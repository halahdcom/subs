1
00:01:46,157 --> 00:01:49,907
Hey, people. How's the job going?

2
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:14,372
Here you are. -Thank you.

3
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:50,260
Cathy, how are you?
- Good and you? -I'm fine.

4
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:54,607
You want as usual? -That.
- Come on, I'm coming right now.

5
00:02:55,317 --> 00:02:59,067
I brought this for the Mouse.

6
00:02:59,353 --> 00:03:03,103
For my Mouse? -That.

7
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:10,605
Thank you. How do you feel? -We have to
go through some more search, but thank you.

8
00:03:10,806 --> 00:03:15,397
If you need help with the kids.
- I will not forget this, Cathy.

9
00:03:34,053 --> 00:03:38,143
Here it is. Dennis
specialty. -Thank you.

10
00:03:39,064 --> 00:03:43,113
Do you need anything else?
- No, it's great. Thank you.

11
00:06:30,856 --> 00:06:34,606
Focus on breathing.

12
00:06:35,499 --> 00:06:39,249
Get down on the mat
when you are ready.

13
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:45,517
And relax with your head
leaning sideways.

14
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:53,094
Now is the time to determine
intentions while you are there.

15
00:06:54,812 --> 00:06:58,562
Anything you want to do.

16
00:07:00,227 --> 00:07:03,977
And focus on that.

17
00:07:07,046 --> 00:07:10,796
Breathe nicely and deeply.

18
00:07:28,207 --> 00:07:34,114
And then stop it
in front of her mat.

19
00:07:42,885 --> 00:07:46,635
Cathy.

20
00:07:47,093 --> 00:07:50,837
Cathy.

21
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:56,417
We raise our hands and
we approach them to our center.

22
00:07:57,855 --> 00:08:02,223
Firmly put beauty into our heart.

23
00:08:02,718 --> 00:08:06,468
And find peace within our exercise.

24
00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:16,816
Alondra, hi. Is it
all right for tonight?

25
00:08:17,217 --> 00:08:23,810
One Warrior poses
let's go to Warrior two.

26
00:08:24,081 --> 00:08:28,059
Gently look over your fingers.

27
00:08:28,635 --> 00:08:33,161
Open your chest and your hips aside.

28
00:08:36,143 --> 00:08:41,982
Excellent. I'll let you know,
I do not know. All right, hi.

29
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:55,527
Not good with the physical
things but also mindful.

30
00:08:55,628 --> 00:08:58,718
My husband is always in business.

31
00:08:58,819 --> 00:09:03,378
One day I noticed these
- <i>Oh, God.</i>

32
00:09:03,479 --> 00:09:09,220
Casey is beautiful. Do you know how to go in
home visits? If you understand me.

33
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:16,041
I do not know the details, I'm sorry.

34
00:09:16,142 --> 00:09:22,239
But he has an internet page so he can
you can find it there. - Exactly, thank you.

35
00:09:40,719 --> 00:09:43,729
I'm sorry. Jesus.

36
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:48,060
I forgot about you
present. I'm Jennifer.

37
00:09:51,147 --> 00:09:54,261
It would be nice to stay
in contact. -Of course.

38
00:09:54,362 --> 00:09:58,112
On Instagram I'm Jennifer Raaz.

39
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:03,962
And your Instagram? -I
I'm Cathy. Cathy @ flowers.

40
00:10:04,063 --> 00:10:08,840
Excellent. I'll follow you.
- Super. -Take care. -Hi. -Hi.

41
00:10:36,196 --> 00:10:39,946
Help!

42
00:10:40,611 --> 00:10:44,825
Not! - I'll kill you here too.

43
00:17:19,232 --> 00:17:23,009
I want you to listen carefully. This
are concrete walls of thickness

44
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:26,986
1.2 meters covered
products for noise absorption.

45
00:17:28,374 --> 00:17:32,124
I know because I did them alone.

46
00:17:33,107 --> 00:17:37,558
I'm talking to you because it makes no sense to
scream. Shake your head if you understand me.

47
00:17:42,322 --> 00:17:47,824
I'll take your tape out of my face and I want to
you say your name. Kim if you understand.

48
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:14,810
Not! Help!

49
00:18:31,326 --> 00:18:36,584
Help me. Please help me.

50
00:21:24,702 --> 00:21:28,452
Help me!

51
00:21:30,584 --> 00:21:34,334
Help!

52
00:21:36,548 --> 00:21:40,298
Help me!

53
00:22:04,336 --> 00:22:11,658
<i>False evidence indicates that the victims are not
died of unnatural death or bickering.</i>

54
00:22:11,859 --> 00:22:15,838
<i>The bodies of the victims represented
are a challenge for investigators.</i>

55
00:22:15,939 --> 00:22:19,689
<i>The case should be reopened.</i>

56
00:23:12,408 --> 00:23:16,158
I see you found the ventilation.

57
00:23:18,162 --> 00:23:22,459
I can leave if you want. You can continue
scream and we'll see how much

58
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:26,756
long will need someone for you
he or she can hear or go to work.

59
00:23:35,028 --> 00:23:38,778
Please do not touch me.

60
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:46,696
I got some money. I have a
$50,000 in savings.

61
00:23:48,742 --> 00:23:53,538
That's a lot of money for a person who is
you deal with your kind of job. -Take it.

62
00:23:56,012 --> 00:23:59,762
I do not want your money.

63
00:24:09,522 --> 00:24:13,258
Animals can smell
death. Did you know that?

64
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:18,114
It was recently a story about
the bull who was waiting in the slaughterhouse.

65
00:24:19,544 --> 00:24:24,282
At the entrance are 3-meter steel walls.

66
00:24:24,617 --> 00:24:29,545
The end of life lurks in the air around him.

67
00:24:30,031 --> 00:24:32,420
Do you know what he did?

68
00:24:32,521 --> 00:24:38,321
Like an animal superhero
he skips the wall and fled the city.

69
00:24:40,135 --> 00:24:44,715
Of course they caught him. They killed him.

70
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,823
They tried to eat it.

71
00:24:48,023 --> 00:24:51,773
But his flesh turned into poison.

72
00:24:52,473 --> 00:24:56,223
It was poisoned with fear.

73
00:24:57,551 --> 00:25:00,869
They'll find my car.

74
00:25:01,069 --> 00:25:06,610
They will take them to you. I promise you if
you do immediately let me tell nobody anybody.

75
00:25:11,431 --> 00:25:15,181
I want you to tell me your name.

76
00:25:21,607 --> 00:25:25,235
Cathy.

77
00:25:25,435 --> 00:25:29,185
My name is Cathy Noland.

78
00:25:41,453 --> 00:25:45,203
My God.

79
00:26:51,545 --> 00:26:55,814
<i>Today is long
the case came to an end.</i>

80

<i>Toxicological finds exhumed
the body did not prove another way of death.</i>

81
00:27:02,692 --> 00:27:08,565
<i>Family members were destroyed by this remark
and announce the fight against that decision.</i>

82
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:12,610
<i>In other news ...</i>

83
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:03,454
Help me!

84
00:30:03,654 --> 00:30:05,839
Help!

85
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:09,789
Shit. Good.

86
00:30:10,994 --> 00:30:14,744
Come on.

87
00:30:19,602 --> 00:30:23,352
Help me!

88
00:30:27,962 --> 00:30:30,145
Anyone!

89
00:30:30,345 --> 00:30:33,834
Please do not kill me. Please.

90
00:30:34,034 --> 00:30:37,784
Please do not kill me.

91
00:30:50,032 --> 00:30:53,782
Oh, shit.

92
00:30:57,154 --> 00:31:00,904
Fuck.
-Jebemti!

93
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:31,303
Somebody help me! Help!

94
00:31:32,162 --> 00:31:36,852
Help! Somebody help me!

95
00:31:37,053 --> 00:31:40,803
Where did you mean to go?

96
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:49,530
Do not get close.

97
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,710
Do not come near, fuck.

98
00:32:00,549 --> 00:32:04,299
How do you know what I'm doing?

99
00:32:05,587 --> 00:32:09,328
You said that was a lot of money for you
someone who is doing my job.

100
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:15,194
How do you know what I'm doing? -You can not
A lot to make selling flowers.

101
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:30,362
The food is better while it is hot.

102
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,070
That's a good way to get to know each other.

103
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,510
Tell me some
things I'm interested in.

104
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:50,100
Your name for the start.

105
00:32:50,669 --> 00:32:54,419
My name is Cathy Noland.

106
00:33:00,496 --> 00:33:03,714
Why not start from scratch?

107
00:33:03,914 --> 00:33:07,664
I just want you to know a little bit better.

108
00:33:09,423 --> 00:33:13,173
Was there any others?

109
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:28,790
Who are you, fuck you?

110
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:34,731
I'm the one with the gun. As far as I know,
the gun is stronger than the knife, so sit down.

111
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:29,360
I guess you're trying to figure me out.

112
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:35,650
I think you're smart.

113
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:40,089
You figured I wanted you
kill me to do it already.

114
00:34:58,956 --> 00:35:02,818
I just asked you one
thing since you came today.

115
00:35:04,707 --> 00:35:08,457
What is this thing?

116
00:35:08,677 --> 00:35:13,389
My name. Tell me your name

117
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:17,580
and then we can actually
start talking.

118
00:35:25,752 --> 00:35:29,502
My name is Cathy Noland.

119
00:35:40,863 --> 00:35:44,613
God!

120
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:15,801
Alondra. What are you doing here?

121
00:37:15,902 --> 00:37:20,542
You remember I called earlier
to see if you need me today?

122
00:37:20,643 --> 00:37:25,900
You said you'd call.
You did not call me so I came.

123
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:29,314
Why is so much mess? -I'm sorry,
Alondra, I forgot to call you.

124
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:33,456
You do not need me today.

125
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:38,833
No, no, leave it.

126
00:37:40,304 --> 00:37:46,547
Is everything OK, Mr. Lewis?
- All right, thank you.

127
00:37:48,371 --> 00:37:52,121
Blur, Mr. Lewis. - Alondra, please.

128
00:37:52,492 --> 00:37:56,242
This is just one of those days.

129
00:37:59,692 --> 00:38:03,442
Now she should go.

130
00:38:03,728 --> 00:38:09,233
Good. I'll come tomorrow with
Summer after lounging.

131
00:40:38,399 --> 00:40:42,149
Let me get you.

132
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:32,567
<i>John Lamptey has passed healthcare
review with the insurance company.</i>

<i>No kidney disease was found.
He was told he was completely healthy.</i>

<i>Investigators are later
detected kidney failure.</i>

135
00:43:50,157 --> 00:43:54,401
No indictment. Lack of evidence
prevented a retrial

<i>for Charleston's three. Members
families have left the courtroom in tears</i>

Are you ready to tell me your name?

140
00:44:31,605 --> 00:44:35,565
I already told you. -Only
tell me what I want to know.

141
00:44:38,057 --> 00:44:42,511
My name is Cathy. -Date of birth?

142
00:44:42,612 --> 00:44:46,617
February 15. -Where are you born?

143
00:44:48,065 --> 00:44:52,638
In Orange County in
California. Where did you go to school?

144
00:44:56,070 --> 00:45:00,588
Medium in TNYU. -What thing?

145
00:45:00,942 --> 00:45:05,279
English. - And later? -Several
years I worked in the library

146
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:09,816
so I came to Atlanta and
she opened her own business.

147
00:45:11,758 --> 00:45:18,677
A church? -Ha? -Are you
raised in the church? -I am not.

148
00:45:20,674 --> 00:45:25,418
Do you have brothers or sisters? -I have not.
- Learning parents? -What is this?

149
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:29,269
Answers to questions.

150
00:45:30,517 --> 00:45:33,664
My parents are divorced.
My dad is dead.

151
00:45:33,782 --> 00:45:37,532
I did not ask you that
but what they were dealing with.

152
00:45:37,803 --> 00:45:42,188
My mom is retired
nurse, and dad worked for

153
00:45:42,289 --> 00:45:46,774
football team. What did he do?
- He was in the staff, he did not play.

154
00:45:47,149 --> 00:45:52,522
Organizer or something. A lots of
he traveled. - Which team? -What?

155
00:45:53,092 --> 00:45:57,232
I was wondering which team. -Detroit Lionse.

156
00:45:59,576 --> 00:46:03,412
So you were born in California,
and dad worked for Detroit Lionse?

157
00:46:03,513 --> 00:46:07,263
I said he had traveled a lot.

158
00:46:12,746 --> 00:46:16,496
I followed you.

159
00:46:16,932 --> 00:46:19,996
I followed you to the moons.

160
00:46:20,196 --> 00:46:25,089
I know you lie almost
for everything I asked you.

161
00:46:27,051 --> 00:46:30,928
Why not go?
scratch? Where are you born?

162
00:46:31,129 --> 00:46:37,180
In California. -I repeat. Where?
- Orange County, California.

163
00:46:37,281 --> 00:46:41,031
Try again. -California!

164
00:46:50,458 --> 00:46:54,208
Next you go to your head.

165
00:46:54,614 --> 00:46:58,364
Where are you born?

166
00:46:58,928 --> 00:47:02,678
Green Bay, Wisconsin.

167
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:11,040
Where did you go to school?

168
00:47:11,434 --> 00:47:15,184
Where did you go to school?!

169
00:47:16,732 --> 00:47:21,296
Easter High. - Are you in the church?

170
00:47:22,186 --> 00:47:25,936
Good church girl?

171
00:47:30,053 --> 00:47:33,533
I can not hear you.

172
00:47:33,733 --> 00:47:37,483
That.

173
00:47:39,589 --> 00:47:44,139
And I know your heart was broken
when the dad left the house.

174
00:47:49,946 --> 00:47:54,055
Who are you? - There are questions.

175
00:47:56,779 --> 00:48:00,270
That broke your heart?

176
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:06,847
That. - Your mother was medical
a sister, and a daddy team doctor.

177
00:48:07,588 --> 00:48:11,338
He left the mommy for the cheerleader.

178
00:48:12,602 --> 00:48:16,352
And it has touched your sister
twin to suicide.

179
00:48:20,286 --> 00:48:24,036
I heard how much you loved her.

180
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:31,590
We all had the people we loved.

181
00:48:34,866 --> 00:48:38,616
But you are a survivor.

182
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:44,307
You went back to school and did it
like something. Why are you doing this?

183
00:48:44,408 --> 00:48:50,516
But there was no English, right?
Like a job in the library, right?

184
00:48:51,346 --> 00:48:55,096
What did you then study?

185
00:48:55,745 --> 00:48:59,495
Answer me! -MEDICINA.

186
00:48:59,959 --> 00:49:04,695
What exactly did you study?
- The patient.

187
00:49:09,729 --> 00:49:14,223
Why not talk about
the biggest part of the puzzle?

188
00:49:14,324 --> 00:49:18,493
About the only thing I want to know
since we came here today.

189
00:49:21,343 --> 00:49:27,293
What's your name? -Cathy.
My name is Cathy. - You do not call.

190
00:49:27,594 --> 00:49:30,777
My name is Cathy.

191
00:49:30,977 --> 00:49:36,266
Cathy was calling your dead sister.

192
00:49:48,996 --> 00:49:52,746
Come on!

193
00:49:59,754 --> 00:50:03,504
Natalie.

194
00:50:06,098 --> 00:50:09,848
My name is Natalie Ann Stevens.

195
00:50:16,964 --> 00:50:20,714
You must wonder why I keep you here.

196
00:50:21,714 --> 00:50:25,464
But you know what, Natalie?

197
00:50:27,402 --> 00:50:31,152
I think you already know.

198
00:52:03,131 --> 00:52:06,881
<i>Oh, no.</i>

199
00:52:12,078 --> 00:52:15,828
<i>Are you hungry?</i>

200
00:53:18,316 --> 00:53:22,048
Come on.

201
00:53:22,248 --> 00:53:25,998
<i>Finally she sleeps.</i>

202
00:53:27,297 --> 00:53:31,047
<i>The most beautiful girl in the world.</i>

203
00:53:36,888 --> 00:53:38,904
Come on.

204
00:53:39,005 --> 00:53:42,899
Police, where it is
problem?</i> -Halo? Police?

205
00:53:44,594 --> 00:53:49,556
Can you hear me? hear
me, the police? Halo.

206
00:54:08,472 --> 00:54:12,222
<i>Oh, no.</i>

207
00:54:16,305 --> 00:54:20,022
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?

208
00:54:20,123 --> 00:54:24,638
My name is Cathy and I'm kidnapped.
Can you locate the signal? Halo.

209
00:54:24,739 --> 00:54:28,582
He put me in a car trunk,
I think it was Dodge.

210
00:54:29,965 --> 00:54:33,715
Hello, do you hear me?

211
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:59,500
Where is? Where's the fucking cell phone?

212
00:55:13,024 --> 00:55:16,222
You want us to finish with this? Alright.

213
00:55:16,323 --> 00:55:20,372
You worked in the hospital, nurse
Stevens. Where were you doing?

214
00:55:20,473 --> 00:55:23,925
St. Mary's Greenmay. And after that?

215
00:55:24,125 --> 00:55:27,175
Little Angels in Charleston.

216
00:55:27,375 --> 00:55:32,380
And how many of these patients died
inexplicable death under your care?

217
00:55:33,489 --> 00:55:40,112
Which? - You know who it is from
Charlestone Troy Was My Wife?

218
00:55:42,553 --> 00:55:48,346
Number three. Alana Mathews Lewis.

219
00:55:49,872 --> 00:55:52,889
Do you remember it?

220
00:55:53,089 --> 00:55:56,015
That's why you moved away, did not you?

221
00:55:56,215 --> 00:56:00,261
Three people died and people died
they became curious.

222
00:56:00,429 --> 00:56:05,351
Nurses were examined.
It was four years ago.

223
00:56:05,452 --> 00:56:09,492
There was also a trial. All sisters
are freed. We were innocent.

224
00:56:09,593 --> 00:56:13,543
Why did you go then?
- I needed a new start.

225
00:56:13,644 --> 00:56:19,741
This trial has ruined my life. -Yes
did those three people get a new start?

226
00:56:19,842 --> 00:56:22,507
What about my wife?

227
00:56:22,707 --> 00:56:26,691
First I dropped the story, but then
some things did not make sense.

228
00:56:26,792 --> 00:56:30,526
For example, a wedding ring
my wife. He never took it off.

229
00:56:30,627 --> 00:56:33,711
Then John Lamptey.
He died of organ failure,

230
00:56:33,812 --> 00:56:37,769
but a month ago it passed
at the doctor. -MR. Lamptey died

231
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:41,726
from undiagnosed diseases
kidney. -Alana was drunk

232
00:56:41,827 --> 00:56:47,572
although I know it was not a lot of shit.
And her blood was full of THP.

233
00:56:48,077 --> 00:56:53,594
Rape for rape. alanine
the blood was full of it.

234
00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:02,865
The court did not find the hospital's failure.
I'm sorry for your loss.

235
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:07,753
Really?

236
00:57:08,416 --> 00:57:12,166
You're not here because
I think you killed my wife.

237
00:57:12,546 --> 00:57:17,976
Here you are because I know you are
he killed and I want to know why.

238
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:23,383
I do not get enough
a good explanation, Natalie,

239
00:57:23,484 --> 00:57:29,759
why did my wife die,
then you will die.

240
00:58:13,103 --> 00:58:17,388
<i>Summer is now four years old.</i>

241
00:58:18,056 --> 00:58:23,691
<i>She's so excited to be
he woke up at five o'clock, did not he?</i>

242
00:58:29,954 --> 00:58:32,878
<i>This is her beautiful mom, Alan.</i>

243
00:58:33,078 --> 00:58:38,162
<i>She's tired because she is
he still has to watch the match.</i>

244
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:42,310
<i>I'm very tired.</i>

245
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,518
<i>Let's paint it.</i>

246
00:59:19,718 --> 00:59:23,509
<i>Greet your family. -Hi.</i>

247
00:59:26,172 --> 00:59:30,750
<i>She's four, old.
She stayed awake all night.</i>

248
00:59:31,685 --> 00:59:35,716
<i>Like mom, she's sleeping all night.</i>

249
00:59:37,203 --> 00:59:43,234
<i>Look at your dad. We are you!
It's very cold and we're freezing.</i>

250
00:59:43,335 --> 00:59:47,085
<i>Snow falls and Summer is dropped.</i>

251
00:59:54,284 --> 00:59:58,034
<i>It's a bit tough.</i>

252
01:00:10,008 --> 01:00:13,760
<i>Happy Thanksgiving Day,
mom and dad. We love you.</i>

253
01:00:13,861 --> 01:00:17,378
<i>Happy Thanksgiving Day,
relatives. -Make a camera.</i>

254
01:00:17,479 --> 01:00:21,829
<i>Say, Get the Gifts! - Put gifts.
- We miss you. - A lot of gifts.</i>

255
01:00:21,930 --> 01:00:25,680
<i>See you soon.</i>

256
01:00:47,253 --> 01:00:51,003
Please do not. Please, I'll tell you.

257
01:00:52,049 --> 01:00:55,799
I'll tell you everything.

258
01:00:59,207 --> 01:01:02,957
Please.

259
01:01:09,934 --> 01:01:13,971
You were right. Sister and I
we were raised in the church.

260
01:01:15,612 --> 01:01:21,766
We have learned the ways of the Bible. They
had we have God in our hearts, we were happy.

261
01:01:21,867 --> 01:01:26,038
We were loved. God protected us.

262
01:01:28,704 --> 01:01:32,682
But not the man who
it was supposed to protect us.

263
01:01:32,883 --> 01:01:37,916
My dad has been having fun for months
with her sister's best friend.

264
01:01:38,191 --> 01:01:43,192
She always lied. Mom found out.

265
01:01:43,293 --> 01:01:46,499
She gathered her courage to face him.

266
01:01:46,698 --> 01:01:50,002
But it's cowardly
packed the jackets and went.

267
01:01:50,103 --> 01:01:56,866
He left us and left with shame.
The locals stopped talking to us.

268
01:01:57,534 --> 01:02:00,547
They stopped looking at us
eyes like we are invisible.

269
01:02:00,648 --> 01:02:04,755
What does this have to do with my wife?
- Sake Sunday we would sit there,

270
01:02:05,277 --> 01:02:09,783
we would listen to churches
the bells they call people on the mass,

271
01:02:09,884 --> 01:02:14,723
and we were holding for
hands. We lost everything.

272
01:02:17,419 --> 01:02:21,169
We did nothing wrong.

273
01:02:21,433 --> 01:02:27,205
We were good people and we were
punished for the father's sins.

274
01:02:28,785 --> 01:02:32,871
And my sister, my dear sister ...

275
01:02:34,485 --> 01:02:38,056
I found her in the stables,

276
01:02:38,230 --> 01:02:41,980
hung on beams.

277
01:02:43,441 --> 01:02:48,545
I have dedicated my life
her. To serve people.

278
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:52,758
Patients in the hospital
they talked to me,

279
01:02:52,859 --> 01:02:56,609
They trust me,
they told me my secrets.

280
01:02:57,922 --> 01:03:01,672
Things they did.

281
01:03:02,704 --> 01:03:06,454
Bad things.

282
01:03:08,938 --> 01:03:12,567
Did you know that John was
Lamptey had two women?

283
01:03:12,668 --> 01:03:15,465
Do you remember Jane Spencer?

284
01:03:15,566 --> 01:03:19,706
She dropped from the second floor
after calling the police

285
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:24,046
and said that her husband was joking. It is
was a lie. She did not even touch it.

286
01:03:24,147 --> 01:03:28,053
He was arrested and charged
for an assassination attempt.

287
01:03:28,154 --> 01:03:32,484
It all confessed to me after I did
he caught hitting the seams on his face

288
01:03:32,585 --> 01:03:37,014
that her wounds look up. Wanted
to take it for divorce.

289
01:03:37,912 --> 01:03:42,095
That man loved her.
- My wife liked me.

290
01:03:42,939 --> 01:03:46,689
Your wife ...

291
01:03:48,368 --> 01:03:53,216
Your wife did not wear a wedding ring

292
01:03:53,351 --> 01:03:56,954
because she spread her legs to another man.

293
01:03:57,055 --> 01:04:02,125
You're lying. - She was at all
four as a fucking bitch.

294
01:04:02,226 --> 01:04:05,081
Do not talk anymore. -Come on.

295
01:04:05,223 --> 01:04:09,022
She was perfectly dressed,
drunk at the hotel bar.

296
01:04:09,123 --> 01:04:12,810
He did not have any documents
to yourself when it crashed.

297
01:04:12,911 --> 01:04:16,768
You really believe it
was in a working meeting?

298
01:04:16,869 --> 01:04:21,330
I saw that guy. stealth
she was visiting her at the hospital.

299
01:04:21,431 --> 01:04:25,509
Feathery, tall guy. Convenient. -Shut up.

300
01:04:25,610 --> 01:04:30,069
He told me they were doing it
constantly. That I can not help.

301
01:04:31,301 --> 01:04:36,331
The Bible says we need it
be honest in marriage.

302
01:04:36,432 --> 01:04:41,233
Your wife was a sinner.
Your wife was a whore.

303
01:04:41,334 --> 01:04:45,339
You did not even cry.
- She was a sinner.

304
01:04:46,171 --> 01:04:51,825
Tell me, who is wrong?

305
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:57,253
You, Natalie?

306
01:04:59,325 --> 01:05:03,075
Or your wife?

307
01:05:09,569 --> 01:05:13,319
I did it.

308
01:05:17,104 --> 01:05:20,854
I want you to say that.

309
01:05:24,239 --> 01:05:27,989
I killed her.

310
01:05:33,782 --> 01:05:37,532
And now you know the reason.

311
01:05:44,819 --> 01:05:48,569
<I>Stop. You are an idiot.</i>

312
01:05:55,785 --> 01:06:00,275
<i>What is it? What do you want me to do?
I tell? My name is Alan.</i>

313
01:06:05,765 --> 01:06:09,515
<i>You're an idiot.</i>

314
01:06:14,859 --> 01:06:18,609
<i>What is it? What do you want me to say?</i>

315
01:09:03,553 --> 01:09:06,348
Do you enjoy that, sir?

316
01:09:06,548 --> 01:09:10,298
I came here first with a woman.

317
01:09:11,455 --> 01:09:14,867
Is your arm good?

318
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:20,376
That. I did not even notice it.
I was doing some housework.

319
01:09:21,114 --> 01:09:26,429
Where's your house? -Over it
bridge, 5 km away.

320
01:09:27,357 --> 01:09:33,021
Do you have a driver's seat, sir?
- Does the problem? - Please, please.

321
01:09:33,394 --> 01:09:37,144
Of course.

322
01:09:48,353 --> 01:09:53,997
All right, Officer? Investigating
a car. Your car corresponds to the description.

323
01:10:02,007 --> 01:10:06,326
Your car is very small
clean, Mr. Lewis. -Is it?

324
01:10:07,855 --> 01:10:10,708
I see.

325
01:10:10,908 --> 01:10:14,658
All is well.

326
01:10:15,905 --> 01:10:19,605
Can I look in the trunk?

327
01:10:19,805 --> 01:10:23,555
Of course.

328
01:10:34,098 --> 01:10:37,848
That's yours? -Ženino.

329
01:10:39,531 --> 01:10:43,615
We apologize for the interference,
sir. -No problem.

330
01:11:47,205 --> 01:11:51,291
What should I say to my daughter when she is
with me? wonder what happened to her mom?

331
01:11:53,175 --> 01:11:59,048
You did not have the right to take away my
wife before but I had a chance to talk to her.

332
01:12:02,547 --> 01:12:06,297
You have to give it to the police.

333
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:10,730
I think that will be a problem.

334
01:12:15,836 --> 01:12:19,586
Why did you have to ruin everything?

335
01:12:19,903 --> 01:12:23,653
My name is Cathy!

336
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:41,576
You think I'm going to give up my life because
of you? I'm Cathy now and I'm so happy.

337
01:12:41,677 --> 01:12:45,427
You expect me to give up
everything? Because of you?

338
01:13:04,722 --> 01:13:08,472
Where's the gun?!

339
01:13:25,708 --> 01:13:29,458
Not!

340
01:14:16,924 --> 01:14:20,789
Dad. -MR. Lewis. -Not!

341
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:24,840
Alondra.

342
01:14:29,951 --> 01:14:32,195
Do not move!

343
01:14:32,395 --> 01:14:36,344
Please do not hurt her.
- Get away, fuck!

344
01:14:37,155 --> 01:14:40,642
Dad! -Summer!

345
01:14:40,842 --> 01:14:45,049
Be very calm, Summer.
Do exactly what the lady says.

346
01:14:45,150 --> 01:14:50,008
Why did you so complicate things?
It was all that easy.

347
01:14:50,288 --> 01:14:54,585
And now this? -Please,
he did not hide anything.

348
01:14:54,686 --> 01:14:58,118
It is not. You did not either.

349
01:14:58,318 --> 01:15:02,103
Neither did I. Natalie,
listen to me. -My name is...

350
01:15:02,825 --> 01:15:06,243
My name is Cathy.

351
01:15:06,443 --> 01:15:12,627
She's a kid! -For everything
this is your fault here!

352
01:15:13,843 --> 01:15:16,828
Dad.

353
01:15:17,028 --> 01:15:22,255
Please. I'm begging you.
Do not hurt my baby.

354
01:15:24,595 --> 01:15:28,345
Your kid.

355
01:15:28,770 --> 01:15:32,520
You think this is your kid?

356
01:15:33,981 --> 01:15:37,731
You were released, Roberta.

357
01:15:42,073 --> 01:15:45,350
Cathy, listen to me.

358
01:15:45,550 --> 01:15:50,326
You do not have to give it to the police.
I will not tell anyone.

359
01:15:50,427 --> 01:15:53,551
I do not believe you. -You can
to return to old life.

360
01:15:53,652 --> 01:15:58,403
I can not. I called the police, they would locate
cell phone. He'll be here. I'll tell them something.

361
01:16:01,816 --> 01:16:07,104
This can only end in one way.
I am very sorry. -Only one thing.

362
01:16:08,761 --> 01:16:11,966
This house shoots everything.

363
01:16:12,166 --> 01:16:16,943
I pray? -You will hear all you've just said.

364
01:16:18,551 --> 01:16:21,363
You're lying.

365
01:16:21,563 --> 01:16:25,313
Summer, get away!

366
01:17:10,206 --> 01:17:13,956
Not.

367
01:17:26,127 --> 01:17:28,521
Summer!

368
01:17:28,721 --> 01:17:31,707
Summer!

369
01:17:31,907 --> 01:17:35,269
Honey.

370
01:17:35,469 --> 01:17:39,219
Summer. Honey.

371
01:17:43,206 --> 01:17:45,644
Oh God.

372
01:17:45,844 --> 01:17:49,594
Let's get outta here.

373
01:17:50,607 --> 01:17:54,357
There you are.

374
01:17:57,271 --> 01:18:01,699
Come. - Dad, there is not.

375
01:18:05,288 --> 01:18:09,038
Come!

376
01:18:10,540 --> 01:18:12,940
Come on in.

377
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:16,890
Close the door. Be here.

378
01:18:23,849 --> 01:18:27,599
Fuck!

379
01:19:46,177 --> 01:19:49,927
Honey. Come.

380
01:20:00,429 --> 01:20:04,179
I'm sorry, Summer. I'm sorry.

381
01:20:28,364 --> 01:20:32,114
I love you.

382
01:20:32,704 --> 01:20:35,576
You are my child.

383
01:20:35,776 --> 01:20:39,526
My child.

384
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:22,340
