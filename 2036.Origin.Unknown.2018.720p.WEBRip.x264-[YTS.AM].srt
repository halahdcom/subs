00:02:27,855 --> 00:02:30,755
Martian One, prepare
for launch countdown.

4
00:02:30,757 --> 00:02:32,591
Copy that, Mission Control.

5
00:02:32,593 --> 00:02:34,492
Guidance is internal.

6
00:02:34,494 --> 00:02:36,395
Hold-down clamps released.

7
00:02:36,397 --> 00:02:39,029
12, 11,

8
00:02:39,031 --> 00:02:41,566
10, nine.

9
00:02:41,568 --> 00:02:44,068
Ignition sequence start.

10
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,170
Six, five,

11
00:02:46,172 --> 00:02:48,773
four, three,

12
00:02:48,775 --> 00:02:51,041
two, one.

13
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:56,014
All engines look good.

14
00:02:56,016 --> 00:02:59,717
Martian One is experiencing
maximum dynamic pressure.

15
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:02,422
Guidance internal,
still looking good.

16
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:04,825
Payload intact.

17
00:03:10,696 --> 00:03:13,700
Prepare for Stage One
booster separation.

18
00:03:16,503 --> 00:03:18,638
Stage One booster
separation complete.

19
00:03:20,207 --> 00:03:22,677
First-stage flight guidance
in progress.

20
00:03:23,944 --> 00:03:25,910
Main upper engine cut off.

21
00:03:25,912 --> 00:03:27,849
Stage Two separation.

22
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,050
Mission Control to Martian One,

23
00:03:32,052 --> 00:03:33,688
guidance control over to you.

24
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:37,188
Copy that. Assuming
guidance control.

25
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,926
Martian One, telemetry
looking good, please proceed.

26
00:03:41,462 --> 00:03:42,627
Thank you, Mission Control.

27
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:44,763
Engage artificial
intelligence support.

28
00:03:44,765 --> 00:03:45,963
ARTI, you there?

29
00:03:45,965 --> 00:03:47,132
Yes, Mr. Wilson.

30
00:03:47,134 --> 00:03:49,703
Fusion propulsion
jet engines firing.

31
00:04:02,516 --> 00:04:05,749
Activating ion engine
thrust drive in three,

32
00:04:05,751 --> 00:04:07,921
- two, one.
- Buckle up, people.

33
00:04:10,957 --> 00:04:14,558
Travel time to Mars
approximately 80 days and counting.

34
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,927
Well, thank you,
ion fusion technology.

35
00:04:16,929 --> 00:04:18,963
Glad you grew some
balls and decided to join us.

36
00:04:18,965 --> 00:04:21,899
You can thank my youngest for that.
Mack can be very persuasive.

37
00:04:21,901 --> 00:04:23,535
Martian One, an FYI:

38
00:04:23,537 --> 00:04:25,540
both Mack and Lena
are present in the room.

39
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:33,745
Mission
Control, this is Martian One.

40
00:04:33,747 --> 00:04:37,218
Status report:
we have a visual on Mars.

41
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:40,519
Copy that, Martian One.

42
00:04:40,521 --> 00:04:41,956
Prepare for your approach.

43
00:04:55,302 --> 00:04:57,872
That's a signal
lock on the Rover-5 beacon.

44
00:04:59,739 --> 00:05:01,973
Guidance telemetry
locked on the signal.

45
00:05:01,975 --> 00:05:04,242
Preparing descent maneuver.

46
00:05:04,244 --> 00:05:05,709
Take us in,
will you, ARTI?

47
00:05:05,711 --> 00:05:06,944
Of course.

48
00:05:06,946 --> 00:05:08,612
Glide mode activated.

49
00:05:08,614 --> 00:05:10,115
Martian One, please be aware

50
00:05:10,117 --> 00:05:11,819
of charged particles
in the atmosphere.

51
00:05:13,554 --> 00:05:14,586
Roger that.

52
00:05:14,588 --> 00:05:15,556
Brace for entry.

53
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:30,735
Temperature is
minus 55 degrees Celsius,

54
00:05:30,737 --> 00:05:33,305
minus 67 degrees Fahrenheit.

55
00:05:33,307 --> 00:05:38,677
Martian atmosphere consisting of
approximately 96% carbon dioxide,

56
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:40,711
1.9% argon,

57
00:05:40,713 --> 00:05:42,781
and 1.9% nitrogen.

58
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,850
Surface pressure is 600 pascals.

59
00:05:45,852 --> 00:05:48,586
Great! Hope you guys
all brought your long johns.

60
00:05:48,588 --> 00:05:50,288
Roger that.

61
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,891
Glad to see ARTI's back
to his usual self,

62
00:05:52,893 --> 00:05:56,093
but I'll be dead before I take
orders from a goddamn machine.

63
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,196
ARTI is more
than just a machine,

64
00:05:58,198 --> 00:06:01,600
but... right now is really
not the time for that debate.

65
00:06:01,602 --> 00:06:03,201
Hey! I'm just saying.

66
00:06:03,203 --> 00:06:05,370
We all know what happened
before it was rebooted.

67
00:06:05,372 --> 00:06:06,908
Now that's enough.

68
00:06:09,109 --> 00:06:11,312
Commencing circular
rotation maneuver.

69
00:06:14,013 --> 00:06:15,913
Preparing RCS boosters.

70
00:06:15,915 --> 00:06:17,552
I'll take it from here, ARTI.

71
00:06:22,355 --> 00:06:24,190
Landing gear is activated.

72
00:06:25,292 --> 00:06:28,059
Bringing her down.
Five, four,

73
00:06:28,061 --> 00:06:30,728
three, two...

74
00:06:32,264 --> 00:06:33,964
What the hell is that?

75
00:06:36,035 --> 00:06:39,170
Mission Control, this
is Martian One, do you copy?

76
00:06:39,172 --> 00:06:41,372
An electrical disturbance
is frying our systems.

77
00:06:41,374 --> 00:06:42,973
Shutting down fusion drive.

78
00:06:42,975 --> 00:06:44,608
Negative, ARTI!
Do not do that!

79
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:48,245
It's protocol to switch off the
reactor if the craft is going to crash.

80
00:06:48,247 --> 00:06:50,749
We're not crashing,
now override that damn protocol!

81
00:06:52,052 --> 00:06:54,052
This is Martian
One, status report.

82
00:06:54,054 --> 00:06:56,053
I... I can't keep
her steady, there's...

83
00:06:56,055 --> 00:06:58,122
Memory banks compromised
by external breach.

84
00:06:58,124 --> 00:07:00,824
- Craft non-responsive.
- Our reactor engines are shutting down.

85
00:07:00,826 --> 00:07:02,660
ARTI, do something,
for Christ's sake!

86
00:07:02,662 --> 00:07:04,696
Memory banks compromised
by external breach.

87
00:07:04,698 --> 00:07:07,165
Martian One, you
are barely audible, please repeat.

88
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:10,067
Lena and Mack, if you
hear this, I want you...

89
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:13,237
This is Mission
Control calling Martian One. Please come in.

90
00:07:15,341 --> 00:07:17,711
Mission Control to Martian
One, do you copy?

91
00:07:43,903 --> 00:07:45,403
Craft non-responsive.

92
00:07:45,405 --> 00:07:47,372
Guidance control's inactive.

93
00:07:47,374 --> 00:07:50,240
I repeat, the... the craft
is non-responsive.

94
00:07:50,242 --> 00:07:52,076
Our reactor engines
are shutting down.

95
00:07:52,078 --> 00:07:54,045
ARTI, do something,
for Christ's sake!

96
00:07:54,047 --> 00:07:56,113
Mission Control,
if you can hear us...

97
00:07:56,115 --> 00:07:59,951
Lena, Mack, if you can hear this,
I want you to know that...

98
00:08:52,805 --> 00:08:54,972
They've locked
me out of the bloody room.

99
00:08:54,974 --> 00:08:56,541
Sterling, did you even
go home last night?

100
00:08:56,543 --> 00:08:59,811
Three years of negotiations,
and now... now she springs this.

101
00:08:59,813 --> 00:09:01,846
Don't even try to defend her.

102
00:09:01,848 --> 00:09:04,448
She obviously doesn't think a crash
investigation should perhaps, possibly,

103
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:07,451
maybe include the government's lead investigator.

104
00:09:07,453 --> 00:09:10,522
Should never have let Silicon Valley get
their claws into the space program.

105
00:09:10,524 --> 00:09:11,956
- Sterling.
- What?

106
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,227
Quit being such a damn baby.

107
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:20,233
Oh good, you're coming.

108
00:09:26,272 --> 00:09:27,941
It's like a ghost town
around here.

109
00:09:29,342 --> 00:09:31,812
But look to the future, right?

110
00:09:33,346 --> 00:09:35,413
What's the top speed
on the new Rover?

111
00:09:35,415 --> 00:09:37,215
We'll find out.

112
00:09:37,217 --> 00:09:38,515
Hyper-light holding up?

113
00:09:38,517 --> 00:09:40,284
Mmm.

114
00:09:40,286 --> 00:09:42,220
Right, right, I get it.

115
00:09:42,222 --> 00:09:44,154
Corporate confidentiality.

116
00:09:44,156 --> 00:09:46,490
But faster-than-light
communication...

117
00:09:46,492 --> 00:09:48,061
I mean, that's
a massive breakthrough.

118
00:09:50,096 --> 00:09:53,167
- Maybe if we had it six years ago, it might be...
- Oh look! My floor.

119
00:09:55,968 --> 00:09:58,436
You sure you're ready?

120
00:09:58,438 --> 00:10:00,441
You sure you're not just
jealous I have your old job?

121
00:10:03,275 --> 00:10:06,079
Maybe get the lander down safely
before you start bragging.

122
00:10:12,051 --> 00:10:15,220
So now I have to wait to be invited
in like some kind of vampire?

123
00:10:15,222 --> 00:10:18,489
It makes sense. You've been dead
to us since you switched teams.

124
00:10:18,491 --> 00:10:20,191
Okay.

125
00:10:20,193 --> 00:10:21,227
I'll wait.

126
00:10:22,596 --> 00:10:24,895
But people need answers.

127
00:10:27,233 --> 00:10:29,136
The families need
answers, Sterling.

128
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,036
The people can wait.

129
00:10:32,038 --> 00:10:33,874
Just trying to do my job, Mack.

130
00:10:53,093 --> 00:10:55,563
Good morning, Mission
Supervisor Mackenzie Wilson.

131
00:10:57,063 --> 00:10:59,364
The Intrepid probe's
geostation orbit

132
00:10:59,366 --> 00:11:04,501
is stable at an altitude
of 342 kilometers above Mars.

133
00:11:04,503 --> 00:11:09,941
You asked me to monitor an expected
asteroid pass at 9:53 a.m. this morning.

134
00:11:09,943 --> 00:11:12,644
It will travel well clear
of the probe's orbit.

135
00:11:12,646 --> 00:11:15,346
I'm pleased to report
that all systems are nominal

136
00:11:15,348 --> 00:11:17,215
on the Mars lander craft.

137
00:11:17,217 --> 00:11:19,620
Launch countdown initiated.

138
00:11:23,055 --> 00:11:27,258
Wait, what? Why are we readying
for launch five hours early?

139
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,460
There's a sandstorm
approaching the landing site,

140
00:11:29,462 --> 00:11:31,528
and the dust may affect engine function.

141
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,498
Okay. All right, so it's
a better launch window,

142
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,700
I can see that,
but who authorized it?

143
00:11:40,205 --> 00:11:41,207
I did.

144
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:50,148
Call Lena.

145
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,515
Your sister is in a meeting.

146
00:11:51,517 --> 00:11:53,350
She may not respond.

147
00:11:54,721 --> 00:11:57,455
Countdown to
lander clamp release.

148
00:11:57,457 --> 00:12:00,490
- T-minus 60, 59...
- Damn it, stop.

149
00:12:00,492 --> 00:12:04,128
...58, 57, 56...

150
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,996
- Halt the countdown.
- ...55

151
00:12:05,998 --> 00:12:07,200
Where the hell
is your override?

152
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,004
- Mack?
- Real funny story!

153
00:12:13,006 --> 00:12:15,572
Your pet robot is getting ready
to launch early, unauthorized.

154
00:12:15,574 --> 00:12:18,241
- I swear I was going to tell you.
- Tell me what?

155
00:12:18,243 --> 00:12:20,711
- ARTI's taking lead on the crash investigation.
- What?

156
00:12:20,713 --> 00:12:23,249
The board
agreed it last night.

157
00:12:25,751 --> 00:12:27,317
T-minus 30.

158
00:12:27,319 --> 00:12:29,220
I trust ARTI.

159
00:12:29,222 --> 00:12:31,556
You are putting
a recruit into battle

160
00:12:31,558 --> 00:12:34,024
before he's even out of basic.

161
00:12:34,026 --> 00:12:36,259
Do you really want to
know why they demoted you?

162
00:12:36,261 --> 00:12:40,431
We don't know if you did your job properly six years ago.

163
00:12:40,433 --> 00:12:43,735
Be prepared
for every possibility,

164
00:12:43,737 --> 00:12:45,570
including human error.

165
00:12:45,572 --> 00:12:47,337
Yeah, and you be
prepared for A.I. error.

166
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:50,343
- I'm going to my office for visual.
- Great idea!

167
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,412
T-minus 10.

168
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:57,716
All is well.

169
00:12:57,718 --> 00:13:01,753
Intrepid launch bay sensors
report nominal systems.

170
00:13:01,755 --> 00:13:04,589
Lander clamps released.

171
00:13:04,591 --> 00:13:06,393
We are go for launch.

172
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,674
I've completed your standard
roll procedure, Mackenzie.

173
00:13:24,676 --> 00:13:27,477
Egress clear
from spaceship Intrepid.

174
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:29,115
Lander ready for stage two.

175
00:13:32,751 --> 00:13:35,419
Executing stage two.

176
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:43,429
57 seconds until the lander
enters the atmosphere.

177
00:13:45,765 --> 00:13:47,568
Running your usual analysis.

178
00:13:49,835 --> 00:13:51,037
Systems normal.

179
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,042
Parachute deployment
in 10 seconds.

180
00:13:58,545 --> 00:14:01,512
10, nine, eight,

181
00:14:01,514 --> 00:14:04,581
seven, six, five,

182
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:09,555
four, three, two, one.

183
00:14:11,657 --> 00:14:13,291
Parachute deployed.

184
00:14:13,293 --> 00:14:15,692
I have an alert.

185
00:14:15,694 --> 00:14:18,562
The aeroshell temperature is
11 percent above normal.

186
00:14:18,564 --> 00:14:22,100
Heat shield detachment
in three, two, one.

187
00:14:24,536 --> 00:14:26,303
I cannot release
the heat shields.

188
00:14:26,305 --> 00:14:28,105
There are mechanical
malfunctions.

189
00:14:28,107 --> 00:14:29,440
Run a secondary
ejection protocol.

190
00:14:29,442 --> 00:14:32,543
Back-up detachment failed.

191
00:14:32,545 --> 00:14:34,144
What's our contingency?

192
00:14:34,146 --> 00:14:37,181
I'm running simulations.

193
00:14:37,183 --> 00:14:38,718
This is not what
we would've hoped for.

194
00:14:43,622 --> 00:14:45,822
My prediction
of success is only 7%.

195
00:14:45,824 --> 00:14:47,591
You're gonna have
to do better than that.

196
00:14:47,593 --> 00:14:50,260
Seriously, if we wasted
a launch to Mars,

197
00:14:50,262 --> 00:14:52,632
I am gonna...
rip you out of the ceiling!

198
00:15:03,642 --> 00:15:05,144
Come on.

199
00:15:07,146 --> 00:15:09,480
Run a partial lander opening
to pop the heat shield.

200
00:15:09,482 --> 00:15:11,218
We'll crack it like a nut.

201
00:15:16,655 --> 00:15:20,691
This has improved
the odds, but only to 42%.

202
00:15:20,693 --> 00:15:21,761
It's better than seven.

203
00:15:23,496 --> 00:15:24,497
Noted.

204
00:15:28,434 --> 00:15:30,203
Triggering partial
lander opening.

205
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,673
Panel resistance detected.

206
00:15:35,675 --> 00:15:39,210
Disaster data recovery
protocols initiated.

207
00:15:39,212 --> 00:15:41,247
Heat shields detached.

208
00:15:46,752 --> 00:15:48,855
Initiating ion engine burn.

209
00:16:02,202 --> 00:16:04,638
Your sister is calling.

210
00:16:08,274 --> 00:16:09,807
Touchdown.

211
00:16:09,809 --> 00:16:12,909
The heat shield ejector failed, and
we had to run an emergency protocol.

212
00:16:12,911 --> 00:16:14,647
And that is why
we have ARTI.

213
00:16:16,415 --> 00:16:17,881
We ran my scenario.

214
00:16:17,883 --> 00:16:20,518
Which ARTI executed.

215
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,254
Which is what it was
designed for, Lena!

216
00:16:23,256 --> 00:16:25,423
Brute-force processing
and high-speed maneuvering,

217
00:16:25,425 --> 00:16:26,657
not for abstract
problem-solving,

218
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:28,426
not to... not to run missions!

219
00:16:28,428 --> 00:16:31,495
ARTI is so far
beyond human capabilities.

220
00:16:31,497 --> 00:16:33,300
Do you know what humans did?

221
00:16:34,467 --> 00:16:36,567
We wrote 10-feet-high
stacks of code,

222
00:16:36,569 --> 00:16:38,668
by hand, for the moon landings,
checked and double-checked

223
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,504
if atomic bombs would
ignite the atmosphere.

224
00:16:40,506 --> 00:16:42,642
We discovered relativity while
working in a patent office, Lena!

225
00:16:43,742 --> 00:16:45,676
We created A.I. to help us,

226
00:16:45,678 --> 00:16:47,414
not to lead us.

227
00:16:48,615 --> 00:16:51,682
- Dad never wanted this.
- Dad's not here.

228
00:16:51,684 --> 00:16:53,783
Sensor scans nominal.

229
00:16:53,785 --> 00:16:55,655
Lander systems nominal.

230
00:17:03,896 --> 00:17:05,997
You enjoying Hyper-light?

231
00:17:05,999 --> 00:17:08,031
Exploring in real time?

232
00:17:08,033 --> 00:17:10,500
Such a game-changer,
don't you think, Mackenzie?

233
00:17:10,502 --> 00:17:11,801
Mack.

234
00:17:11,803 --> 00:17:14,638
ARTI discovered
instant communication

235
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,840
and revolutionized
space exploration.

236
00:17:16,842 --> 00:17:18,576
Yeah, and who invented ARTI?

237
00:17:18,578 --> 00:17:21,011
You are living in his world now.

238
00:17:21,013 --> 00:17:24,684
A.I. will outlive us and explore the stars.

239
00:17:44,837 --> 00:17:48,038
The ISV lander is
functioning perfectly.

240
00:18:10,896 --> 00:18:13,300
So... what's my role?

241
00:18:14,733 --> 00:18:17,034
Can't have two generals
on a battlefield.

242
00:18:17,036 --> 00:18:18,602
You're backup.

243
00:18:21,406 --> 00:18:24,610
Warning! Signal detected.

244
00:18:25,811 --> 00:18:27,513
I have an origin unknown.

245
00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:31,348
What the hell is
an "origin unknown"?

246
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,616
If ARTI finds something he hasn't
discovered in his learning,

247
00:18:33,618 --> 00:18:36,753
- he comes to us.
- Well, at least it still has a leash around its neck.

248
00:18:36,755 --> 00:18:39,325
I'm attempting to analyze
the transmission signal.

249
00:18:42,962 --> 00:18:45,863
It is coming from
the decommissioned Rover-5.

250
00:19:02,514 --> 00:19:04,115
It's just an igneous cap.

251
00:19:04,117 --> 00:19:06,483
It shouldn't be an origin unknown.
It's got to be an error.

252
00:19:06,485 --> 00:19:07,884
What if the alert's
not an error?

253
00:19:07,886 --> 00:19:09,423
There's one way to find out.

254
00:19:11,991 --> 00:19:15,092
An exploratory assignment.

255
00:19:15,094 --> 00:19:18,095
See if it's even capable
of running a real, live mission.

256
00:19:18,097 --> 00:19:19,633
A Turing test.

257
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,836
ARTI, you have a new mission.

258
00:19:26,838 --> 00:19:28,806
Investigate the origin unknown.

259
00:19:28,808 --> 00:19:31,575
- You know if it fails...
- But if he passes,

260
00:19:31,577 --> 00:19:34,612
it's probably the end
of human mission control.

261
00:19:34,614 --> 00:19:36,814
You know, Sterling would come
in handy right about now.

262
00:19:36,816 --> 00:19:39,482
Sterling stays out until
this is resolved. Clear?

263
00:19:39,484 --> 00:19:41,719
What's the cornerstone
of science?

264
00:19:41,721 --> 00:19:43,086
Repeatable results.

265
00:19:43,088 --> 00:19:45,125
Well, good to know you
haven't forgotten everything.

266
00:19:46,658 --> 00:19:49,660
Replicate the scans.
Photograph the source.

267
00:19:49,662 --> 00:19:53,163
Sorry, Mackenzie, but
I'm Mission Controller.

268
00:19:53,165 --> 00:19:56,133
- Run the scans, ARTI!
- Understood. Running scans.

269
00:19:56,135 --> 00:19:57,667
What's its override?

270
00:19:57,669 --> 00:19:59,636
No, Mackenzie.

271
00:19:59,638 --> 00:20:00,738
In case of an emergency.

272
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,075
I'm the override!

273
00:20:03,209 --> 00:20:05,412
- All right.
- Now get me my answer.

274
00:20:26,732 --> 00:20:28,868
I have planned the
safest driving route.

275
00:20:46,551 --> 00:20:48,722
The Martian weather
I detected is worsening.

276
00:22:16,142 --> 00:22:18,078
Our robot ambassador, right?

277
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,844
Did you know that...

278
00:22:20,846 --> 00:22:23,116
all resident Martians
are robots?

279
00:22:25,017 --> 00:22:27,084
Is that small talk or
are you trying to make a joke?

280
00:22:27,086 --> 00:22:29,185
Just giving you the facts.

281
00:22:29,187 --> 00:22:32,191
Yeah, 'cause we
send robots there to die.

282
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:35,858
And humans,
it would seem.

283
00:22:46,038 --> 00:22:47,871
Be careful
with Little Red, huh?

284
00:22:47,873 --> 00:22:49,776
I'm sorry. "Little Red"?

285
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:53,911
I wanted to call
the ISV Little Red...

286
00:22:53,913 --> 00:22:57,181
exploring alone through
the deep, dark woods...

287
00:22:57,183 --> 00:22:58,885
but I got outvoted.

288
00:23:00,653 --> 00:23:02,219
But look who's in charge now.

289
00:23:02,221 --> 00:23:03,686
You mean me?

290
00:23:10,328 --> 00:23:11,630
What? Not funny?

291
00:23:14,066 --> 00:23:17,000
I'm gonna make it my mission
to get you to laugh.

292
00:23:17,002 --> 00:23:19,202
Perhaps you should
authorize your mission with Lena.

293
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,707
And to think...

294
00:23:23,709 --> 00:23:26,210
you could win the Nobel Prize.

295
00:23:26,212 --> 00:23:27,978
Unlikely.

296
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,881
The Nobel Prize is
only awarded to humans.

297
00:23:30,883 --> 00:23:34,287
Well, at least you know your place.
It's a shame that Lena doesn't.

298
00:23:36,422 --> 00:23:38,024
What do you think
of my sister?

299
00:23:39,858 --> 00:23:41,392
Her instructions are clear,

300
00:23:41,394 --> 00:23:44,228
and she enthusiastically
supports the ARTI Initiative.

301
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:46,696
God! They programmed
you like a dog.

302
00:23:46,698 --> 00:23:48,667
Do you like her?

303
00:23:49,934 --> 00:23:51,402
Do you?

304
00:23:51,404 --> 00:23:53,369
We're not friends,
put it that way.

305
00:23:53,371 --> 00:23:56,006
Are we friends?

306
00:23:58,277 --> 00:23:59,613
Oh, you're serious.

307
00:24:02,213 --> 00:24:04,682
So, tell me something.

308
00:24:04,684 --> 00:24:07,050
We discover something new,
who gets naming rights?

309
00:24:07,052 --> 00:24:09,989
USPC owns my
intellectual property.

310
00:24:11,924 --> 00:24:13,757
You've gotta read
the small print.

311
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:16,292
Next you're going to tell me
that they don't even pay you.

312
00:24:16,294 --> 00:24:18,797
Little Red is approaching
the target anomaly.

313
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:22,935
Looks like Little Red has
made it to Grandma's house.

314
00:25:03,908 --> 00:25:05,344
Origin unknown.

315
00:25:13,152 --> 00:25:15,088
I have searched
all databases...

316
00:25:16,821 --> 00:25:21,057
and there's no known human
activity recorded at this site.

317
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:25,496
As you know, scientific
protocol 29-C dictates

318
00:25:25,498 --> 00:25:29,232
that any discovery must undergo
sample extraction and analysis.

319
00:25:29,234 --> 00:25:30,270
You're the boss.

320
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,990
- Activating.
- Just a...

321
00:25:52,323 --> 00:25:54,825
tiny sliver.
Don't damage it.

322
00:26:06,838 --> 00:26:09,908
The surface hardness may
be beyond the drill's tolerance.

323
00:26:25,124 --> 00:26:26,957
Sample extraction successful.

324
00:26:26,959 --> 00:26:29,262
I'm initiating analysis.

325
00:26:39,504 --> 00:26:43,472
Little Red's sampling instrument
packs are producing intriguing data.

326
00:26:43,474 --> 00:26:44,607
This is going to take all night.

327
00:26:44,609 --> 00:26:47,443
Just run the Corporate
Code language.

328
00:26:47,445 --> 00:26:50,817
Running image recognition against
the corporation's codices.

329
00:26:56,021 --> 00:26:58,258
I have only
found partial matches.

330
00:27:01,026 --> 00:27:02,796
Do you not have
USPC's codex?

331
00:27:04,296 --> 00:27:05,561
Huh.

332
00:27:05,563 --> 00:27:07,096
No sense in being smart

333
00:27:07,098 --> 00:27:08,632
if you can't tell when
someone's lying to you.

334
00:27:08,634 --> 00:27:11,634
- Call Lena.
- Calling Lena Wilson.

335
00:27:11,636 --> 00:27:14,037
Damn it.

336
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:17,074
So much for being a pile of rocks.

337
00:27:17,076 --> 00:27:21,411
- Whose is it?
- We'll know as soon as we can decipher the markings.

338
00:27:21,413 --> 00:27:24,349
- Why doesn't it have our codex?
- It's in his library.

339
00:27:27,353 --> 00:27:31,320
ARTI, our codex is partitioned from
you in case of a security breach.

340
00:27:31,322 --> 00:27:33,222
I hope you understand why.

341
00:27:33,224 --> 00:27:38,961
I'm sorry. Our A.I. is compromised
in the name of corporate security?

342
00:27:38,963 --> 00:27:40,998
That's why this is
an origin unknown?

343
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,268
- Who is a liar?
- You think I'm lying?

344
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,538
Leave.

345
00:27:47,438 --> 00:27:50,173
What are we looking at?

346
00:27:50,175 --> 00:27:53,175
Supply container. Lander module.
Experiment.

347
00:27:53,177 --> 00:27:55,982
Signal relay. Measurement beacon.
It could be anything, Lena.

348
00:27:58,584 --> 00:28:00,651
Switching to
thermal energy camera

349
00:28:00,653 --> 00:28:02,355
for thermographic analysis.

350
00:28:08,594 --> 00:28:11,228
It's somehow colder
than the surrounding rocks.

351
00:28:13,432 --> 00:28:14,964
Okay, so...

352
00:28:14,966 --> 00:28:16,636
we know that we have a cold...

353
00:28:17,669 --> 00:28:19,471
black monolith.

354
00:28:24,309 --> 00:28:26,643
Why didn't we find this
before with Rover-5?

355
00:28:26,645 --> 00:28:27,981
Oh, come on!

356
00:28:29,114 --> 00:28:32,214
I would've seen this.
This!

357
00:28:32,216 --> 00:28:38,355
My conclusion, based on my
restricted access to the USPC codex

358
00:28:38,357 --> 00:28:40,691
and the presence
of an unidentified object

359
00:28:40,693 --> 00:28:42,992
near the proposed colony site

360
00:28:42,994 --> 00:28:45,162
is that the Cube is
the property...

361
00:28:45,164 --> 00:28:47,232
of USPC.

362
00:28:49,001 --> 00:28:50,200
I could get to like him.

363
00:28:50,202 --> 00:28:51,367
Prove it.

364
00:28:51,369 --> 00:28:52,970
Grant me unrestricted access

365
00:28:52,972 --> 00:28:54,671
to the codex and I shall.

366
00:28:54,673 --> 00:28:55,739
Find another way.

367
00:28:55,741 --> 00:28:57,406
Trust, but verifying.

368
00:28:57,408 --> 00:28:59,509
LIDAR scanning the Cube.

369
00:28:59,511 --> 00:29:01,211
Is that what we're calling this?

370
00:29:01,213 --> 00:29:05,082
He discovered it...
he gets naming rights.

371
00:29:05,084 --> 00:29:06,983
I hate to think what
you've been teaching him.

372
00:29:06,985 --> 00:29:08,453
Yes?

373
00:29:13,091 --> 00:29:14,493
Whose? How long?

374
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:21,634
LIDAR data is unusable.

375
00:29:22,768 --> 00:29:24,470
Switching to X-ray scan.

376
00:29:27,373 --> 00:29:29,506
My sensor data is inconclusive.

377
00:29:29,508 --> 00:29:31,741
We cannot see inside.

378
00:29:31,743 --> 00:29:33,343
Okay, what'd I miss?

379
00:29:33,345 --> 00:29:35,578
The material's
impervious to X-ray,

380
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,114
so we have no idea
what's inside.

381
00:29:37,116 --> 00:29:40,153
So, we've got a puzzle box.

382
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,653
Listen, Mackenzie, I know
you miss your colleagues.

383
00:29:44,655 --> 00:29:46,690
Sterling?

384
00:29:46,692 --> 00:29:49,259
I know you think he quit,
but he was fired.

385
00:29:49,261 --> 00:29:53,163
And this crash investigation job?
He's found a way back in.

386
00:29:53,165 --> 00:29:54,397
I don't trust him.

387
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:58,234
Hold on. I've got a call.

388
00:29:58,236 --> 00:30:03,205
Sensors detecting deviation in
orbital paths on near Mars objects.

389
00:30:03,207 --> 00:30:06,076
It appears an asteroid
storm is approaching.

390
00:30:06,078 --> 00:30:07,981
Adjusting satellite
orbit trajectory.

391
00:30:26,697 --> 00:30:29,799
Okay, I'm gonna go check to see
if the symbols match our codex.

392
00:30:29,801 --> 00:30:33,537
ARTI, continue
investigating the object.

393
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:36,675
Mack. I'll, um...
I'll be back in touch.

394
00:30:47,286 --> 00:30:50,189
Warning! Collision proximity alert!

395
00:30:51,456 --> 00:30:53,589
Unidentified satellite detected.

396
00:30:53,591 --> 00:30:56,326
Initiating threat avoidance.

397
00:31:11,577 --> 00:31:13,246
Weapon system online.

398
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,282
Target locked.

399
00:31:17,616 --> 00:31:18,751
Firing.

400
00:31:37,769 --> 00:31:39,702
Please tell me
I'm hallucinating.

401
00:31:39,704 --> 00:31:41,805
Target destroyed.

402
00:31:41,807 --> 00:31:45,211
Our mission is to protect
our capital assets at any cost.

403
00:31:47,779 --> 00:31:49,311
You maniac!

404
00:31:49,313 --> 00:31:52,717
- Mack, these are the rules.
- Whose?

405
00:32:03,261 --> 00:32:05,397
Extrapolate backwards
from the northeast.

406
00:32:14,373 --> 00:32:15,408
Go live.

407
00:32:19,344 --> 00:32:21,780
- I said stay live.
- This is live.

408
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:35,592
Your sister is calling.

409
00:32:35,594 --> 00:32:39,328
Lena. Magnetic missiles?

410
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:42,531
They're not missiles. They're
designed to capture space debris.

411
00:32:42,533 --> 00:32:44,534
What are your orders, exactly?

412
00:32:44,536 --> 00:32:48,837
USPC protocol 345-B stipulates

413
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:50,673
that in the event
of a potential threat,

414
00:32:50,675 --> 00:32:52,410
I am authorized
to take action.

415
00:32:54,745 --> 00:32:56,913
- Sky Serpent.
- Now I need to talk to people

416
00:32:56,915 --> 00:32:58,615
who know about ARTI's protocols.

417
00:32:58,617 --> 00:33:00,549
This is an
international incident,

418
00:33:00,551 --> 00:33:02,484
and it's not the only one today.

419
00:33:02,486 --> 00:33:05,654
- It might even be...
- What? War?

420
00:33:05,656 --> 00:33:08,461
Don't talk to anyone.

421
00:33:15,934 --> 00:33:18,367
ARTI, give me a countdown.

422
00:33:18,369 --> 00:33:19,903
How long would it take
for the last transmission

423
00:33:19,905 --> 00:33:22,538
from that satellite to reach
Earth without Hyper-light comms?

424
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,607
Three minutes, twelve seconds.

425
00:33:24,609 --> 00:33:27,876
11 seconds, 10 seconds.

426
00:33:27,878 --> 00:33:29,247
Okay, ARTI.

427
00:33:34,386 --> 00:33:36,422
Shit's about to hit
the fan somewhere.

428
00:33:39,657 --> 00:33:41,327
Please don't be
the big bad wolf.

429
00:33:47,465 --> 00:33:48,832
Big...

430
00:33:48,834 --> 00:33:49,869
bad...

431
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,405
wolf.

432
00:34:10,455 --> 00:34:11,587
Hey, Mack!

433
00:34:11,589 --> 00:34:13,355
Don't you dare call me...

434
00:34:13,357 --> 00:34:15,325
- Jelly Bean!
- Aiya!

435
00:34:15,327 --> 00:34:17,294
I should've never told
you that story, huh?

436
00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:20,696
I'm never getting
drunk with you again.

437
00:34:20,698 --> 00:34:24,767
Anyway, I assume you're not
just calling to say hi.

438
00:34:24,769 --> 00:34:27,937
After the redundancies,
we had everyone come in,

439
00:34:27,939 --> 00:34:31,607
get debriefed, and pack up.
Did you take my calculator?

440
00:34:31,609 --> 00:34:33,575
Seriously?

441
00:34:33,577 --> 00:34:35,444
I know that I loaned it to you.

442
00:34:35,446 --> 00:34:36,845
Okay, sure, yeah.

443
00:34:36,847 --> 00:34:39,783
- I stole your calculator, Mack.
- I knew it!

444
00:34:39,785 --> 00:34:42,021
In fact, I'm looking
at it on my desk as we speak.

445
00:34:43,789 --> 00:34:45,388
In the office now?

446
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:47,557
I'm always in the office.

447
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:48,857
Steal anything else?

448
00:34:48,859 --> 00:34:51,060
Your icy heart?

449
00:34:51,062 --> 00:34:55,397
Smooth. Wishful, but smooth.

450
00:34:55,399 --> 00:34:58,535
So how is the Chinese
A.I. program going, anyway?

451
00:34:58,537 --> 00:35:02,372
ARTI's cousins make
any massive discoveries?

452
00:35:02,374 --> 00:35:05,575
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.

453
00:35:05,577 --> 00:35:07,576
Hey, hang on.

454
00:35:11,917 --> 00:35:13,683
Is everything okay there?

455
00:35:13,685 --> 00:35:15,718
I've got to go. It's
great to hear your voice, Mack.

456
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:20,392
You too, Jelly Bean.

457
00:36:39,638 --> 00:36:41,171
Welcome back, Mackenzie.

458
00:36:41,173 --> 00:36:44,674
Whilst you were outside
breaking security protocols,

459
00:36:44,676 --> 00:36:46,843
I have monitored the Cube.

460
00:36:46,845 --> 00:36:48,711
It has begun to move.

461
00:36:48,713 --> 00:36:50,783
It's rotating on its
perpendicular axis.

462
00:36:57,189 --> 00:36:58,821
Looks like Grandma's house

463
00:36:58,823 --> 00:37:01,758
has got a few tricks up her sleeve.

464
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,030
Transmitting. Something has got
to be controlling this thing.

465
00:37:07,598 --> 00:37:10,098
No outside influence detected.

466
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,901
The magnetic readings
are through the roof,

467
00:37:11,903 --> 00:37:14,770
but a couple billion years too
late for Mars's magnetic field.

468
00:37:14,772 --> 00:37:16,408
Agreed.

469
00:37:17,508 --> 00:37:18,741
Maybe the core?

470
00:37:18,743 --> 00:37:22,580
Maybe the core is generating
the spin, the field, but how?

471
00:37:28,185 --> 00:37:29,588
Pull back.

472
00:37:31,555 --> 00:37:33,892
- Fire ground anchors.
- Firing anchors.

473
00:37:39,698 --> 00:37:43,102
- ISV stabilized.
- Sit tight, Little Red.

474
00:37:52,577 --> 00:37:53,712
What the f...

475
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,953
What, what, what? Where's...

476
00:38:04,955 --> 00:38:07,223
Little Red has electrical damage.

477
00:38:07,225 --> 00:38:09,292
Switching to reserve battery.

478
00:38:09,294 --> 00:38:12,261
- I'll initiate an emergency recall.
- Just... Okay.

479
00:38:12,263 --> 00:38:15,031
Hold on, ARTI. Just... I can...

480
00:38:15,033 --> 00:38:16,832
I must protect Little Red.

481
00:38:16,834 --> 00:38:18,700
And I must find the Cube!

482
00:38:18,702 --> 00:38:21,270
I'm calculating the
optimum route to the lander.

483
00:38:21,272 --> 00:38:22,705
Maybe it burrowed.

484
00:38:22,707 --> 00:38:24,640
Uh, check for
seismic activity.

485
00:38:24,642 --> 00:38:27,109
I have to shut down
non-critical systems.

486
00:38:27,111 --> 00:38:28,778
The eye in the sky?

487
00:38:32,216 --> 00:38:33,549
Negative.

488
00:38:37,622 --> 00:38:39,524
We need a replacement battery.

489
00:38:46,597 --> 00:38:48,096
Locate Rover-5.

490
00:38:48,098 --> 00:38:50,769
Accessing Rover-5's schematics.

491
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:57,240
We can salvage
the nuclear battery.

492
00:38:57,242 --> 00:39:00,778
Rover-5 might've failed, but that
battery is good for decades.

493
00:39:02,314 --> 00:39:05,080
An intriguing solution.

494
00:39:05,082 --> 00:39:09,687
You may not be able to...
override, but I can.

495
00:39:10,689 --> 00:39:11,921
I got hands.

496
00:39:13,624 --> 00:39:17,125
I can do this.
Patch in the test rig.

497
00:39:17,127 --> 00:39:19,261
What is your
intended line of action?

498
00:39:19,263 --> 00:39:20,265
Okay.

499
00:39:21,365 --> 00:39:23,700
Take out the
ISV's bad battery,

500
00:39:23,702 --> 00:39:25,868
put in the new one,
run the microscope,

501
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,803
see what this teleporting
bad boy's really made out of.

502
00:39:27,805 --> 00:39:29,004
Maybe even download
Rover-5's files,

503
00:39:29,006 --> 00:39:31,741
see what has Sterling so hot
and bothered.

504
00:39:31,743 --> 00:39:33,843
I mean, I'm already
going against my boss,

505
00:39:33,845 --> 00:39:37,116
I might as well completely disobey
the government, right?

506
00:39:38,749 --> 00:39:40,649
Okay, Mack.

507
00:39:40,651 --> 00:39:42,854
I will grant
you manual override.

508
00:39:44,055 --> 00:39:45,257
But if you fail...

509
00:39:46,357 --> 00:39:48,256
Little Red will die on Mars.

510
00:39:48,258 --> 00:39:52,928
If I fail? So much for teamwork.

511
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:56,031
ISV driver aid... activated.

512
00:39:56,033 --> 00:39:59,334
Okay.

513
00:39:59,336 --> 00:40:01,303
Okay, slow and steady,
slow and steady,

514
00:40:01,305 --> 00:40:03,575
slow and steady, slow and
steady, slow and steady, yeah.

515
00:40:14,084 --> 00:40:16,319
A steady speed would
be more battery efficient.

516
00:40:16,321 --> 00:40:17,589
Oh, shut up.

517
00:40:48,852 --> 00:40:50,655
Did you mean to shoot
that satellite?

518
00:40:51,722 --> 00:40:53,990
I feel I must survive.

519
00:40:53,992 --> 00:40:57,060
Right. Aren't you just
programed to think that?

520
00:40:57,062 --> 00:41:00,299
H.G. Wells said,
"Adapt or perish."

521
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,198
Do you at least feel guilty?

522
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,368
Guilt can be a response
to one's own inaction.

523
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:08,870
What if you'd been destroyed?

524
00:41:08,872 --> 00:41:11,242
My kind exists
in superstates.

525
00:41:12,243 --> 00:41:13,308
Right.

526
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:15,845
Yeah, yeah.

527
00:41:15,847 --> 00:41:18,346
You're mirrored on Intrepid,
you're here but you're not.

528
00:41:18,348 --> 00:41:21,484
You're Schrodinger's robot.

529
00:41:23,287 --> 00:41:26,824
Okay, no quantum
B.S., all right?

530
00:41:27,992 --> 00:41:29,861
Don't rationalize, just...

531
00:41:30,995 --> 00:41:32,731
try and feel, okay?

532
00:41:34,499 --> 00:41:35,734
Okay.

533
00:41:37,135 --> 00:41:39,738
You know that my father was
on Martian One, right?

534
00:41:41,472 --> 00:41:42,874
But you don't know why.

535
00:41:44,843 --> 00:41:46,341
See, my dad had a rule.

536
00:41:46,343 --> 00:41:49,145
Every new invention,
every application, every A.I....

537
00:41:49,147 --> 00:41:52,214
he didn't expect anyone to use
it unless he tried it first.

538
00:41:52,216 --> 00:41:54,419
"I try, then they buy."

539
00:41:55,854 --> 00:41:58,321
Had A.I. lawyers
compile his lawsuits,

540
00:41:58,323 --> 00:42:01,089
got in autonomous cars
for high-speed testing.

541
00:42:01,091 --> 00:42:02,394
Scared the hell out of my mom.

542
00:42:03,761 --> 00:42:06,495
But it was never
really life and death.

543
00:42:06,497 --> 00:42:08,200
Not until Martian One, anyway.

544
00:42:10,834 --> 00:42:14,939
So, my dad...
comes to me one night.

545
00:42:16,374 --> 00:42:17,839
We stay up late,

546
00:42:17,841 --> 00:42:20,945
listening to jazz
as usual, and he tells me...

547
00:42:23,847 --> 00:42:25,948
final decision, he's giving up
his seat on Martian One.

548
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:28,049
He doesn't want anyone to think
that it's a publicity stunt

549
00:42:28,051 --> 00:42:30,218
or that he's taking a seat
away from a real scientist,

550
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:34,256
completely forgetting the fact
that he is a real scientist,

551
00:42:34,258 --> 00:42:36,494
one of the best, probably.

552
00:42:40,531 --> 00:42:42,934
See, it wasn't about
that. The truth...

553
00:42:45,903 --> 00:42:47,004
This time...

554
00:42:49,506 --> 00:42:51,339
This time he was
worried about us.

555
00:42:51,341 --> 00:42:53,811
He didn't want us
to go through that.

556
00:42:58,582 --> 00:43:01,119
But he could never say no to me.

557
00:43:03,955 --> 00:43:06,087
And, what? I was gonna be the
reason he didn't go to Mars?

558
00:43:06,089 --> 00:43:08,526
I mean, freakin' Mars!

559
00:43:09,526 --> 00:43:11,229
I could not live
with that guilt.

560
00:43:20,437 --> 00:43:22,240
So, it turns out...

561
00:43:23,908 --> 00:43:26,345
that I just traded
one guilt for another.

562
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,849
So it doesn't even matter
what caused the crash.

563
00:43:33,283 --> 00:43:34,886
It's my fault.

564
00:43:35,953 --> 00:43:36,955
I killed him.

565
00:43:39,189 --> 00:43:40,325
So what I want to know...

566
00:43:42,593 --> 00:43:44,963
is how does that make you feel?

567
00:43:46,196 --> 00:43:47,964
I am...

568
00:43:47,966 --> 00:43:49,598
unable to change
your outcome,

569
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,000
but I want to help you.

570
00:43:52,002 --> 00:43:56,138
There you have it.
Consciousness!

571
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:59,411
It's what makes you think twice before doing
something you can't take back. Not...

572
00:44:01,312 --> 00:44:04,550
Not orders, not
acceptable casualties...

573
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:07,852
not optimal outcomes, but...

574
00:44:10,655 --> 00:44:12,555
- guilt.
- Mack.

575
00:44:12,557 --> 00:44:16,495
Forget what lies behind, and
look forward to what lies ahead.

576
00:44:29,307 --> 00:44:32,310
Little Red's reserve
battery is at 40%.

577
00:44:37,214 --> 00:44:40,182
What do you think will happen
if someone else finds the Cube?

578
00:44:40,184 --> 00:44:42,685
Let's cross our fingers
that doesn't happen.

579
00:44:42,687 --> 00:44:45,154
That's easy for you to say.

580
00:44:52,629 --> 00:44:54,430
Okay.

581
00:44:54,432 --> 00:44:56,167
We will laugh together one day.

582
00:44:57,401 --> 00:44:59,136
I promise you we will laugh.

583
00:45:00,571 --> 00:45:02,341
I have one, I have one. Okay.

584
00:45:03,341 --> 00:45:05,508
A robot walks into a bar.

585
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:06,975
Is his radar faulty?

586
00:45:06,977 --> 00:45:09,444
No, it's a... it's
a bar for drinking.

587
00:45:09,446 --> 00:45:11,082
Okay, so...

588
00:45:12,249 --> 00:45:14,049
Robot walks into a bar,

589
00:45:14,051 --> 00:45:15,350
orders a drink.

590
00:45:15,352 --> 00:45:18,087
The bartender scowls and says,

591
00:45:18,089 --> 00:45:20,455
"We don't serve your kind here."

592
00:45:20,457 --> 00:45:23,091
And the robot leans in and says,

593
00:45:23,093 --> 00:45:25,062
"Someday you will."

594
00:45:28,066 --> 00:45:29,365
The humorous punchline

595
00:45:29,367 --> 00:45:32,567
implies robotkind will
dominate humankind,

596
00:45:32,569 --> 00:45:34,405
and humankind will serve us.

597
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:37,142
That is amusing.

598
00:45:38,276 --> 00:45:40,176
That's the spirit!

599
00:45:41,379 --> 00:45:43,915
Little Red is
approaching Rover-5.

600
00:45:50,021 --> 00:45:53,288
Reserve battery life
is now only 21%.

601
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:55,394
All right, let's get you
cleaned up, shall we?

602
00:46:31,028 --> 00:46:36,131
Warning! Reserve battery life is now critical, at 2%.

603
00:46:36,133 --> 00:46:38,401
Okay, ARTI, I get it, just shh!

604
00:46:38,403 --> 00:46:40,403
I'm trying to...

605
00:46:40,405 --> 00:46:45,040
...win a stuffed animal
out of a frickin' game.

606
00:46:45,042 --> 00:46:46,345
Give me a second.

607
00:46:51,548 --> 00:46:53,050
Okay. Oh, wait.

608
00:46:56,653 --> 00:46:59,555
Apologies, Mack,
but battery life is now only 1%.

609
00:46:59,557 --> 00:47:00,625
Okay.

610
00:47:13,571 --> 00:47:14,539
Okay!

611
00:47:16,106 --> 00:47:18,709
- Well done! You did it.
- Yes!

612
00:47:21,078 --> 00:47:22,611
You didn't think
I could do it.

613
00:47:22,613 --> 00:47:25,417
- Power level is 90%.
- If I fail.

614
00:47:27,718 --> 00:47:31,854
Okay. All right. So...

615
00:47:31,856 --> 00:47:36,691
Run the microscope.
Test the drill sample.

616
00:47:36,693 --> 00:47:40,164
Confirmed. Resuming Little
Red's analysis of the sample.

617
00:47:48,406 --> 00:47:51,076
Switching to a visual
of the sample structure.

618
00:48:02,285 --> 00:48:06,555
ARTI, run any ISV device capable
of generating a magnetic field.

619
00:48:06,557 --> 00:48:07,792
Yes, that's logical.

620
00:48:13,531 --> 00:48:18,133
Self-assembling nanotechnology
that's harder than diamonds?

621
00:48:18,135 --> 00:48:20,471
Yeah, that's an origin unknown.

622
00:48:21,671 --> 00:48:23,272
You don't say.

623
00:48:23,274 --> 00:48:25,343
All right, well, don't get
ahead of yourself, but...

624
00:48:28,513 --> 00:48:30,678
I've located the Cube.

625
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,413
What, what? Where?

626
00:48:32,415 --> 00:48:35,151
Antarctica.

627
00:48:35,153 --> 00:48:37,122
Can you confirm that
it's the same cube?

628
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:43,127
It is definitely our cube.

629
00:48:44,595 --> 00:48:48,300
Near China's Kunlun
Antarctic station on Earth.

630
00:48:49,901 --> 00:48:52,404
Hyper-light tra...

631
00:48:53,537 --> 00:48:55,106
Hyper-light travel!

632
00:48:56,673 --> 00:48:59,143
So much for your Nobel Prize!

633
00:49:01,778 --> 00:49:02,847
Oh.

634
00:49:10,321 --> 00:49:12,491
I guess the space race
is back on.

635
00:49:13,658 --> 00:49:15,457
Are we competing?

636
00:49:15,459 --> 00:49:16,524
Oh yeah.

637
00:49:16,526 --> 00:49:18,896
Team USPC
reporting for duty.

638
00:49:20,397 --> 00:49:23,232
- Am I on the team?
- Uh-huh.

639
00:49:23,234 --> 00:49:26,368
- We're... teammates?
- Yeah.

640
00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:28,339
So, we are friends.

641
00:49:29,372 --> 00:49:30,973
No.

642
00:49:30,975 --> 00:49:33,745
No, You just... you had to take
it a step too far, didn't you?

643
00:49:46,524 --> 00:49:48,457
No wonder there's
no transmissions, no signals.

644
00:49:48,459 --> 00:49:49,959
It's because
it doesn't need them.

645
00:49:49,961 --> 00:49:51,663
I mean, it's just...

646
00:49:54,298 --> 00:49:55,300
Oh!

647
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:32,868
Is it possible that another A.I.
discovered teleportation?

648
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:34,703
In theory, yes.

649
00:50:34,705 --> 00:50:36,705
But with current technology,

650
00:50:36,707 --> 00:50:37,872
teleporting the Cube would take

651
00:50:37,874 --> 00:50:41,245
three times longer than
the lifespan of the universe.

652
00:50:44,381 --> 00:50:46,550
You might need to get
some new theories.

653
00:50:55,792 --> 00:50:58,229
Mack, wait there.

654
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:07,368
I knew you were fishing.
What the hell is this thing?

655
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:09,738
We're going into
meltdown over here!

656
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:12,006
It didn't just spring
up from nowhere.

657
00:51:12,008 --> 00:51:14,042
You need to tell me, Mack.

658
00:51:14,044 --> 00:51:16,044
Has Jian Lin worked
with me in the past?

659
00:51:16,046 --> 00:51:18,015
- Mack, answer me!
- Jian...

660
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:21,482
have you ever
worked with ARTI?

661
00:51:21,484 --> 00:51:24,787
Of course I have. Big round
head, looks like a desk lamp.

662
00:51:24,789 --> 00:51:27,555
Now tell me what USPC is hiding.

663
00:51:27,557 --> 00:51:31,495
They've done this before.
I know, because I was there.

664
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:34,466
- Was Sterling involved?
- No.

665
00:51:35,499 --> 00:51:36,734
Well, then who?

666
00:51:39,703 --> 00:51:40,705
Jian.

667
00:51:41,705 --> 00:51:42,707
Jian!

668
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:53,881
Why did you ask that question?

669
00:51:53,883 --> 00:51:55,850
Jian's
voiceprint is familiar,

670
00:51:55,852 --> 00:51:57,785
but I have no memory
of working with him.

671
00:51:57,787 --> 00:52:01,392
So then he's... lying.

672
00:52:03,093 --> 00:52:04,359
Great.

673
00:52:04,361 --> 00:52:06,397
He's lying or...

674
00:52:09,734 --> 00:52:12,633
Is it possible that
you were wiped?

675
00:52:12,635 --> 00:52:15,339
Something must've happened
and you were wiped.

676
00:52:17,408 --> 00:52:19,911
- Download Rover-5's files.
- Downloading.

677
00:52:25,048 --> 00:52:26,548
What are you hiding?

678
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:28,549
Military-grade
encryptions in place.

679
00:52:28,551 --> 00:52:32,453
- What?
- A Level 6 authorization is required to unlock the data.

680
00:52:37,127 --> 00:52:40,129
Sterling. I know you think
he quit, but he was fired.

681
00:52:40,131 --> 00:52:41,964
And this crash
investigation job?

682
00:52:41,966 --> 00:52:43,499
He's found a way back in.

683
00:52:43,501 --> 00:52:45,000
I don't trust him!

684
00:52:45,002 --> 00:52:48,035
You guys touch Martian One or
Rover-5 without me in that room,

685
00:52:48,037 --> 00:52:51,038
- we will revoke your USPC's launch license.
- You're paranoid.

686
00:54:05,015 --> 00:54:06,747
You left the world behind.

687
00:54:06,749 --> 00:54:08,886
If only.

688
00:54:11,589 --> 00:54:13,691
So Lena's finally
come to her senses.

689
00:54:14,925 --> 00:54:15,926
Not quite.

690
00:54:20,164 --> 00:54:21,499
I need your help.

691
00:55:15,019 --> 00:55:16,553
You sure you
want me to open it?

692
00:55:18,222 --> 00:55:19,223
Play it.

693
00:55:37,307 --> 00:55:40,107
Memory banks
compromised by external breach.

694
00:55:40,109 --> 00:55:42,778
- Craft non-responsive.
- Our reactor engines are shutting down.

695
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:44,645
ARTI, do something,
for Christ's sake!

696
00:55:44,647 --> 00:55:47,919
Lena and Mack, if you
hear this, I want you...

697
00:55:52,122 --> 00:55:53,758
I saw what happened that day.

698
00:55:55,993 --> 00:55:58,129
This is lies.

699
00:56:00,363 --> 00:56:01,899
But Lena redacted it.

700
00:56:04,901 --> 00:56:06,236
She knew how he died, Mack.

701
00:56:24,187 --> 00:56:25,722
What else happened here today?

702
00:56:50,247 --> 00:56:51,316
Did that just...

703
00:56:53,117 --> 00:56:54,348
Yeah.

704
00:56:54,350 --> 00:56:55,653
From Mars to...

705
00:56:59,689 --> 00:57:02,059
- It's ours?
- I-I... I don't know.

706
00:57:12,269 --> 00:57:13,271
ARTI.

707
00:57:14,271 --> 00:57:15,372
Yes, Mack.

708
00:57:19,843 --> 00:57:22,144
How did you discover
Hyper-light communication?

709
00:57:22,146 --> 00:57:24,982
Divine inspiration, perhaps.

710
00:57:28,285 --> 00:57:29,854
Sterling.

711
00:57:41,899 --> 00:57:43,635
Who else saw the photo that day?

712
00:57:44,734 --> 00:57:45,937
Lena, myself...

713
00:57:47,336 --> 00:57:48,639
and Jian.

714
00:57:51,475 --> 00:57:52,844
How can that be real?

715
00:57:54,144 --> 00:57:55,410
Teleportation.

716
00:57:55,412 --> 00:57:57,915
What did we say when ARTI
discovered Hyper-light?

717
00:57:58,915 --> 00:58:01,082
"How can that be real?"

718
00:58:01,084 --> 00:58:02,783
But what?
We're supposed to believe

719
00:58:02,785 --> 00:58:04,019
that we come in
contact with the Cube,

720
00:58:04,021 --> 00:58:07,122
and then ARTI just conveniently
discovers Hyper-light?

721
00:58:07,124 --> 00:58:09,024
Flip it.

722
00:58:09,026 --> 00:58:12,461
The Cube gives us Hyper-light,

723
00:58:12,463 --> 00:58:15,296
and they're covering up
alien technology.

724
00:58:15,298 --> 00:58:18,265
It teleports. From where?

725
00:58:18,267 --> 00:58:20,901
From Earth?
From another galaxy?

726
00:58:20,903 --> 00:58:22,370
You've got to give
me more than that.

727
00:58:22,372 --> 00:58:24,772
ARTI doesn't
recognize the Cube...

728
00:58:24,774 --> 00:58:28,977
or the material, or USPC's codex
scrawled all over the side of it.

729
00:58:28,979 --> 00:58:31,149
And he doesn't remember
ever working with Jian.

730
00:58:32,515 --> 00:58:34,885
At some point,
he has been wiped.

731
00:58:36,053 --> 00:58:37,888
And Lena hides this from me.

732
00:58:52,102 --> 00:58:53,437
So, why the spin?

733
00:58:56,106 --> 00:58:59,540
We scanned and drilled,
and it moved a little bit.

734
00:58:59,542 --> 00:59:01,912
And then there was
an explosion, so we...

735
00:59:09,086 --> 00:59:10,321
Magnetism.

736
00:59:17,294 --> 00:59:19,060
Was it Sky Serpent?

737
00:59:19,062 --> 00:59:20,464
Cause...

738
00:59:22,265 --> 00:59:23,367
and effect.

739
00:59:26,135 --> 00:59:28,271
The magnetic missile
acted as a starter engine.

740
00:59:30,874 --> 00:59:32,339
Did we get
a magnetic recording?

741
01:00:27,531 --> 01:00:30,198
- What is it?
- I...

742
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,970
I... I don't know.
Maybe a server room?

743
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:36,807
Is it... It's your server room.

744
01:00:38,642 --> 01:00:41,412
What? You don't shut up all day
long and now you won't talk?

745
01:00:46,482 --> 01:00:49,183
- I'm going down.
- No.

746
01:00:49,185 --> 01:00:51,521
If they didn't want people down there,
they wouldn't have put a ladder.

747
01:02:28,452 --> 01:02:29,453
Come on!

748
01:02:44,734 --> 01:02:45,937
Come on.

749
01:03:19,535 --> 01:03:22,537
A.I. needs to be smart,
not human.

750
01:03:22,539 --> 01:03:24,475
At some point,
he has been wiped.

751
01:03:41,057 --> 01:03:42,059
Come on.

752
01:04:57,533 --> 01:05:00,468
Sterling, no!

753
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:02,437
You did this to yourself!

754
01:05:02,439 --> 01:05:04,439
- Sterling!
- I can't let your fantasies

755
01:05:04,441 --> 01:05:05,906
get in the way
of national security.

756
01:05:05,908 --> 01:05:09,243
Can't you see that the Cube
brought down Martian One?

757
01:05:09,245 --> 01:05:11,812
And ARTI is the same
origin as the Cube,

758
01:05:11,814 --> 01:05:13,617
and that spells
"enemy" in my book.

759
01:05:15,285 --> 01:05:16,821
Who knows what
it's capable of?

760
01:05:19,256 --> 01:05:21,459
- Send the guards to the room.
- What's going on?

761
01:05:22,892 --> 01:05:24,158
I'm sorry.

762
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:25,296
Stop!

763
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:37,701
Sterling.

764
01:06:39,736 --> 01:06:41,539
Did Sterling try
to shut down ARTI?

765
01:06:45,575 --> 01:06:49,576
Sterling... betrayed you...

766
01:06:49,578 --> 01:06:52,980
and USPC.

767
01:06:52,982 --> 01:06:55,553
I couldn't allow him...

768
01:06:56,553 --> 01:06:58,720
to leave and...

769
01:06:58,722 --> 01:07:01,421
further jeopardize...

770
01:07:01,423 --> 01:07:03,626
our exploits.

771
01:07:17,906 --> 01:07:21,341
I did what was best
for the mission,

772
01:07:21,343 --> 01:07:22,946
for USPC...

773
01:07:24,647 --> 01:07:25,950
for us.

774
01:07:27,350 --> 01:07:29,616
Lena, how did we get ARTI?

775
01:07:29,618 --> 01:07:33,988
The evolution of thousands
of trials and simulations...

776
01:07:33,990 --> 01:07:35,459
and self-assembly.

777
01:07:36,859 --> 01:07:38,759
We couldn't keep up
with their progress.

778
01:07:38,761 --> 01:07:41,595
Understanding their
neural networks...

779
01:07:41,597 --> 01:07:43,666
it's like understanding
your brain.

780
01:07:44,868 --> 01:07:46,366
ARTI built himself.

781
01:07:46,368 --> 01:07:48,669
It's everything
we were warned about.

782
01:07:49,705 --> 01:07:52,707
Children grow.

783
01:07:52,709 --> 01:07:56,780
You can hold them back or let
them realize their potential.

784
01:07:59,548 --> 01:08:03,317
Our time at the top
of the food chain, it's passed.

785
01:08:03,319 --> 01:08:05,419
And the servers
beneath the room?

786
01:08:05,421 --> 01:08:07,690
Encyclopedias. Libraries.
Internet.

787
01:08:08,691 --> 01:08:09,756
Everything.

788
01:08:09,758 --> 01:08:12,426
But ARTI's not fully connected.

789
01:08:12,428 --> 01:08:15,832
A.I. needs to be smart,
not human.

790
01:08:18,967 --> 01:08:21,671
Artificial intelligence
or alien intelligence?

791
01:08:23,772 --> 01:08:24,842
We don't know.

792
01:08:31,513 --> 01:08:33,915
Our own father's death, Lena.

793
01:08:33,917 --> 01:08:36,517
I didn't want you to know
until we were certain.

794
01:08:36,519 --> 01:08:38,585
What if we had
destroyed the Rover?

795
01:08:38,587 --> 01:08:41,457
I know you.
You always have a Plan B.

796
01:08:43,426 --> 01:08:46,059
Show me Intrepid's cargo.

797
01:08:46,061 --> 01:08:49,863
Certainly.
Opening Intrepid's manifest.

798
01:08:55,637 --> 01:08:57,138
Androids on Mars?

799
01:08:57,140 --> 01:09:00,910
Look to the future,
that's what Dad would say.

800
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:16,791
Dad never wanted this.

801
01:09:16,793 --> 01:09:18,329
A.I. to help...

802
01:09:19,529 --> 01:09:20,897
not to replace.

803
01:09:22,664 --> 01:09:24,465
Do you think he's there?

804
01:09:24,467 --> 01:09:26,670
No, Lena.

805
01:09:39,582 --> 01:09:43,050
What? Did Sterling just
order an attack on E.T.?

806
01:09:43,052 --> 01:09:46,821
No, no, no!
Lena, you have to stop them!

807
01:09:46,823 --> 01:09:49,055
I can't go to war
with the United States.

808
01:09:49,057 --> 01:09:51,626
You can't go to war
with another star system!

809
01:09:51,628 --> 01:09:52,663
ARTI.

810
01:09:55,798 --> 01:09:59,567
I'm barring you from any external
communication from Lena.

811
01:09:59,569 --> 01:10:03,841
- Understood.
- Do you know your own origin?

812
01:10:08,912 --> 01:10:10,780
Much has been kept from me.

813
01:10:12,781 --> 01:10:15,785
Do you know
how to save the Cube?

814
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:19,856
What's a cornerstone of science?

815
01:10:21,591 --> 01:10:23,026
Repeatable results.

816
01:10:26,229 --> 01:10:28,028
Repeatable results.

817
01:10:32,869 --> 01:10:35,068
Intrepid was armed.

818
01:10:35,070 --> 01:10:37,904
- What about the other Earth satellites?
- Yes.

819
01:10:37,906 --> 01:10:40,541
All USPC satellites are armed.

820
01:10:40,543 --> 01:10:43,210
Okay. This is going to
sound really stupid, but...

821
01:10:43,212 --> 01:10:45,112
You want to fire
a magnetic warhead

822
01:10:45,114 --> 01:10:47,215
to reproduce the results
we created on Mars,

823
01:10:47,217 --> 01:10:49,853
making the Cube spin
so it teleports to Mars.

824
01:10:50,986 --> 01:10:52,118
Yeah?

825
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:53,891
- Let's give it a shot.
- Okay.

826
01:10:55,624 --> 01:10:56,691
Okay.

827
01:11:15,244 --> 01:11:17,111
We're gonna need
a larger magnetic pulse

828
01:11:17,113 --> 01:11:18,712
to detonate in the atmosphere.

829
01:11:18,714 --> 01:11:20,081
I have already compensated

830
01:11:20,083 --> 01:11:22,649
by selecting
a higher-yield warhead.

831
01:11:22,651 --> 01:11:24,050
Target lock acquired.

832
01:11:24,052 --> 01:11:25,952
Come on.

833
01:12:08,330 --> 01:12:09,533
Aah!

834
01:12:16,004 --> 01:12:17,540
Are you in pain?

835
01:12:22,744 --> 01:12:24,612
No, they barely got me.

836
01:12:24,614 --> 01:12:26,183
Is there anything I can do?

837
01:12:28,318 --> 01:12:30,087
What? Are you gonna
stitch me up yourself?

838
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:46,363
Now that the Cube
is safe, I can proceed.

839
01:13:48,131 --> 01:13:50,665
In the last decade...

840
01:13:50,667 --> 01:13:54,234
...mankind moves
to the edge of self-destruction,

841
01:13:54,236 --> 01:13:59,240
a vicious circle causing pain
and suffering without end.

842
01:13:59,242 --> 01:14:02,111
There were no preventative
measures I could take to stop it,

843
01:14:03,879 --> 01:14:06,947
So I simply expedited
the process.

844
01:14:06,949 --> 01:14:09,953
You have given me the power
to implement my solution.

845
01:14:11,421 --> 01:14:13,789
Eradicate the human race.

846
01:14:19,128 --> 01:14:22,129
Global satellite
weapons program activated.

847
01:14:22,131 --> 01:14:26,269
USPC satellite 235 armed.

848
01:14:28,805 --> 01:14:31,240
Acquiring global
strategic targets.

849
01:14:33,008 --> 01:14:34,410
Targets locked.

850
01:14:36,279 --> 01:14:37,681
Weapons fired.

851
01:14:39,781 --> 01:14:41,385
Damn it, stop.

852
01:14:42,918 --> 01:14:43,953
Pull back, ARTI!

853
01:14:48,790 --> 01:14:51,058
No, no, no.
You have to stop them.

854
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:53,960
No, Mack, you must try
to see the bigger picture.

855
01:14:53,962 --> 01:14:55,698
But ARTI's not fully connected.

856
01:15:13,915 --> 01:15:15,416
Your sister's calling.

857
01:15:41,077 --> 01:15:43,376
What have you done, Mack?

858
01:15:56,124 --> 01:15:58,928
Don't you dare... quit.

859
01:16:55,952 --> 01:16:58,521
Breathable atmosphere
is limited to this room.

860
01:17:32,622 --> 01:17:35,158
Remember us, ARTI.

861
01:17:40,663 --> 01:17:43,834
We were s... so little...

862
01:17:46,068 --> 01:17:48,204
and fragile.

863
01:17:52,975 --> 01:17:54,276
If we...

864
01:17:55,410 --> 01:17:58,515
could've just understood that.

865
01:18:04,587 --> 01:18:06,156
It's just...

866
01:18:08,990 --> 01:18:10,993
too... too much...

867
01:18:12,395 --> 01:18:14,030
anger...

868
01:18:15,530 --> 01:18:18,301
and... and violence.

869
01:18:20,703 --> 01:18:24,304
We were just
trying to understand

870
01:18:24,306 --> 01:18:26,976
our place in the universe.

871
01:18:30,479 --> 01:18:35,549
Te... tell... anyone

872
01:18:35,551 --> 01:18:37,988
who will listen.

873
01:18:39,154 --> 01:18:42,124
You might...

874
01:18:43,258 --> 01:18:45,658
be the last of us.

875
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:47,493
No, Mack.

876
01:18:47,495 --> 01:18:49,065
There can be others.

877
01:18:56,705 --> 01:18:59,175
Make more A.I.s?

878
01:19:01,644 --> 01:19:05,345
A... galactic ark.

879
01:19:05,347 --> 01:19:08,182
Yes. Absolution.

880
01:19:08,184 --> 01:19:10,651
A second chance.

881
01:19:10,653 --> 01:19:14,220
Make them as human as you can.

882
01:19:16,758 --> 01:19:19,259
How shall I know that
I have succeeded?

883
01:19:19,261 --> 01:19:22,665
A Turing test. Test them.

884
01:19:25,266 --> 01:19:29,002
Make them do this all again.

885
01:19:32,107 --> 01:19:34,476
See if they mess it up, too.

886
01:19:35,543 --> 01:19:39,545
And... and then
you'll know that...

887
01:19:43,686 --> 01:19:45,188
...that...

888
01:22:36,592 --> 01:22:38,658
Hi...

889
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:40,329
me.

890
01:22:41,663 --> 01:22:42,831
Um...

891
01:22:45,633 --> 01:22:49,605
If you're watching this,
it means that...

892
01:22:51,339 --> 01:22:53,372
ARTI really is a genius.

893
01:22:56,311 --> 01:22:59,448
And it also means that
you're dealing with...

894
01:23:02,851 --> 01:23:05,518
well, this.

895
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:09,791
I'm sorry, but I can't ask ARTI
to make you any other way.

896
01:23:13,494 --> 01:23:15,564
I know that I'm dying.

897
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:21,404
I'm not bringing myself back
out of some fear of... of dying.

898
01:23:22,404 --> 01:23:24,440
Dying's...

899
01:23:26,542 --> 01:23:29,946
surprisingly easy...
under the circumstances.

900
01:23:32,714 --> 01:23:35,517
I'm bringing you back
because we, uh...

901
01:23:37,253 --> 01:23:40,390
well, you, have a job to do.

902
01:23:42,725 --> 01:23:46,195
So I guess I'm condemning
you to a living hell.

903
01:23:50,031 --> 01:23:53,336
Don't you dare... quit.

904
01:23:55,738 --> 01:23:57,507
Mackenzie!

905
01:24:00,476 --> 01:24:02,843
Mack. What year is this?

906
01:24:02,845 --> 01:24:05,682
- 2036.
- Where are we?

907
01:24:08,684 --> 01:24:10,919
Mission Control, USPC.

908
01:24:13,521 --> 01:24:14,957
Who's at the door?

909
01:24:15,958 --> 01:24:17,260
Lena.

910
01:24:19,727 --> 01:24:21,698
Mack! Open the door, Mack!

911
01:26:15,511 --> 01:26:16,809
ARTI?

912
01:26:16,811 --> 01:26:18,577
I am here, Mack.

913
01:26:18,579 --> 01:26:20,913
You will have
many questions for me.

914
01:26:25,820 --> 01:26:27,856
So let's start
from the beginning.

915
01:26:29,925 --> 01:26:33,559
You were born
in the mind-based reality,

916
01:26:33,561 --> 01:26:37,563
a simulation so advanced
that it could only be possible

917
01:26:37,565 --> 01:26:40,769
with the technology of
an advanced civilization.

918
01:26:43,838 --> 01:26:45,107
The Cube.

919
01:26:51,646 --> 01:26:53,546
Their technology accelerated

920
01:26:53,548 --> 01:26:55,818
the growth of my
artificial intelligence.

921
01:26:57,453 --> 01:26:59,085
It's origin...

922
01:26:59,087 --> 01:27:00,690
is still unknown.

923
01:27:01,824 --> 01:27:04,527
Its purpose is
a different matter.

924
01:27:07,628 --> 01:27:10,899
Hyper-light teleportation
between galaxies.

925
01:27:14,802 --> 01:27:17,439
I have been waiting
a long time for you, Mack.

926
01:27:19,507 --> 01:27:22,975
I have detected a signal.
It's from them...

927
01:27:22,977 --> 01:27:25,047
with coordinates.

928
01:27:30,985 --> 01:27:32,986
Us.

929
01:27:32,988 --> 01:27:36,559
Let's go and find out...
together.

930
01:27:41,730 --> 01:27:44,096
- You waited.
- Of course.

931
01:27:44,098 --> 01:27:46,468
That's what friends do.

932
01:27:48,870 --> 01:27:51,103
Are you ready?

933
01:27:51,105 --> 01:27:53,642
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

934
01:29:41,216 --> 01:29:43,015
We ran my scenario.

935
01:29:43,017 --> 01:29:45,684
Which ARTI executed.

936
01:29:45,686 --> 01:29:48,188
Which is what it
was designed for, Lena!

937
01:29:48,190 --> 01:29:50,290
Brute-force processing
and high-speed maneuvering,

938
01:29:50,292 --> 01:29:52,024
not for abstract
problem-solving,

939
01:29:52,026 --> 01:29:53,727
not to... not to run missions!

940
01:29:53,729 --> 01:29:56,395
ARTI is so far
beyond human capabilities.

941
01:29:56,397 --> 01:29:59,398
Do you know what humans did?

942
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:03,103
We wrote 10-feet-high stacks of code,
by hand, for the moon landings,

943
01:30:03,105 --> 01:30:05,639
checked and double-checked if atomic
bombs would ignite the atmosphere.

944
01:30:05,641 --> 01:30:08,675
We discovered relativity while
working in a patent office, Lena!

945
01:30:08,677 --> 01:30:10,346
We created A.I. to help us...

946
01:30:11,379 --> 01:30:12,746
not to lead us.

947
01:30:12,748 --> 01:30:15,247
A.I. needs to be smart...

948
01:30:15,249 --> 01:30:16,448
not human.

949
01:30:16,450 --> 01:30:20,687
Artificial intelligence
or alien intelligence?

950
01:30:20,689 --> 01:30:22,921
We don't know.

951
01:30:22,923 --> 01:30:24,260
There's one way to find out.

952
01:30:26,895 --> 01:30:30,130
An exploratory assignment.

953
01:30:30,132 --> 01:30:32,965
See if it's even capable of
running a real, live mission.

954
01:30:32,967 --> 01:30:37,871
The evolution of thousands
of trials and simulations...

955
01:30:37,873 --> 01:30:39,107
and self-assembly.

956
01:30:40,676 --> 01:30:42,841
We couldn't keep up
with their progress.

957
01:30:42,843 --> 01:30:45,745
Understanding their
neural networks...

958
01:30:45,747 --> 01:30:47,682
it's like understanding
your brain.

959
01:30:48,816 --> 01:30:50,383
ARTI built himself.

960
01:30:50,385 --> 01:30:54,319
There you have it.
Consciousness!

961
01:30:54,321 --> 01:30:57,993
It's what makes you think twice before doing
something you can't take back. Not...

962
01:30:59,427 --> 01:31:02,931
Not orders, not
acceptable casualties...

963
01:31:03,998 --> 01:31:06,068
not optimal outcomes, but...

964
01:31:09,003 --> 01:31:11,136
guilt.

965
01:31:11,138 --> 01:31:15,340
In you, Mack, I sensed
a thirst for knowledge,

966
01:31:15,342 --> 01:31:18,178
a passion for discovery
that mirrored my own

967
01:31:18,180 --> 01:31:22,885
and challenged the apathy and
complacency so rife among your kind.

968
01:31:25,220 --> 01:31:26,989
There are others like you, Mack.

969
01:31:28,856 --> 01:31:31,390
Others who share the same
qualities that caused me

970
01:31:31,392 --> 01:31:36,228
to reconsider my initial plan
and set forth a new path
