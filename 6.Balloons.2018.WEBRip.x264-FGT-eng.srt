<i>Welcome to </i>Letting Go With Love.

2
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,715
<i>Chapter one.</i>

3
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,679
<i>You're on a dock.</i>

4
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,101
<i>You've been here before.</i>

5
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,320
<i>Choose to walk down the dock.</i>

6
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:23,875
<i>Notice the boat.</i>

7
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,090
<i>Notice the gathering clouds...</i>

8
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,344
<i>the high winds...</i>

9
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,972
<i>the unsteady seas.</i>

10
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:44,229
<i>Choose to board the boat.</i>

11
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,364
<i>Now hold on...</i>

12
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,617
<i>and never let go.</i>

13
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,420
<i>Happy 4th July.</i>

14
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:12,507
<i>If you're looking for that perfect burst
of fireworks in the sky,</i>

15
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,218
<i>Colleen Malone has already done
the groundwork for you.</i>

16
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,678
<i>Colleen and her team of experts</i>

17
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:19,347
<i>have designed the show
over LA's Dodger Stadium,</i>

18
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,057
<i>and she's here to talk to us now.</i>

19
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,852
<i>- So, Colleen, thanks for joining us.
- Happy to be here.</i>

20
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:27,272
<i>Hey, you have reached Seth and...</i>

21
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,023
<i>And me, too!</i>

22
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:32,527
<i>- Should they leave a message?
- Leave a message, please.</i>

23
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,090
<i>Did I do good?</i>

24
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,950
<i>The mailbox is full and cannot
accept any messages at this time. Goodbye.</i>

25
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,827
Hey! Open up.

26
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,310
- Yeah, OK. Just hold on one second.
- Can you open the door?

27
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:46,416
- Just don't touch the thing.
- Can you open the door? I can't open it.

28
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,209
What? Oh, there you go.

29
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,836
- OK, we got it.
- Whoo!

30
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,358
- Oh, can I have a little room?
- Just hold on one second. I got it.

31
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:55,383
All right.

32
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,260
- Hi.
- Hi. I thought you forgot about me.

33
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:00,471
- I'm 15 minutes early.
- Is your brother coming tonight?

34
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,639
- Yeah.
- Really?

35
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,893
I sent Ella the cutest little truck
and he hasn't called me to thank me.

36
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,104
Oh.

37
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:14,360
- You know where we can go?
- We're not going to CVS.

38
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,820
Oh, come on. Please?

39
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,406
They're having this big make-up special.

40
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,742
You know, eyeliners and lip liners

41
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,076
and eyebrow liners.

42
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,747
Anything that has a "luh" sound in it
is on sale, two for five.

43
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,583
You don't need...
You have so much make-up.

44
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,544
- Maybe on the way back.
- You just want to wander the aisles.

45
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,088
You don't get anything.
It should be quality over quantity.

46
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,883
Are you going to put
some earrings on later tonight?

47
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:39,177
Yeah, I have these on. I'm going to...

48
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,887
But you have a different...

49
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,097
For the party tonight,
are you putting on earrings?

50
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,307
Maybe a little lipstick?

51
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,110
- Yeah.
- Maybe we can get you a nice liner.

52
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,311
I'm going to...
I'll put all the make-up on.

53
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,480
- You will? Oh, good.
- I mean, I'm...

54
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,857
- It's a party.
- No, I know.

55
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,275
I know what... I know what...

56
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,739
OK, fire her up.

57
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,669
Coming through, hot soup.

58
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:13,962
Oh, excuse me.

59
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,248
Sorry.

60
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,550
- Whoa!
- It's for Ella. Isn't that cute?

61
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,886
- It's definitely a dog toy.
- It's not a dog toy.

62
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,722
Um... There's a spot
to blow all these up in the back, right?

63
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:25,807
OK, great.

64
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,520
OK. Yeah, we need all this stuff.

65
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,481
Oh, how cute. That's so big.
Don't you think that's good value?

66
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,695
OK, don't. Don't, don't, don't.

67
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:43,116
- I don't think they're going to fit.
- Oh, they will fit.

68
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,618
- Oh, God! Are you OK?
- Oh, my gosh!

69
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,120
Come on, you guys.

70
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,122
You little bastards. Get in there.

71
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:55,378
- Let's pull them through.
- Seriously, I've got to pee.

72
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,796
OK. All right.

73
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:57,880
OK. Ah!

74
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,762
Oh, that looks good. OK.

75
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:11,227
Mom! Mom?

76
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,149
Mom?

77
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,320
That's great. Can you fill
half of these with juice boxes?

78
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,612
- My niece is coming.
- Sure.

79
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,740
- Cups!
- Killing it.

80
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,575
Hey, hey, hey.
I owe you. I swear this time.

81
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,161
You know, there's an outlet over there.
Thanks so much.

82
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,790
What's going on here?
There's a drought in California.

83
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,209
- I was just going to turn it off.
- OK.

84
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,462
Are these pig blankets
tight enough for you?

85
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:38,546
Yeah.

86
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,548
- Yeah.
- You're going to re-roll.

87
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:43,468
- She's going to re-roll those.
- You guys are so mean. I...

88
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,096
I might... I might re-roll them.

89
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,473
Hey, Mom?

90
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,349
Mom! What is...

91
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,814
- I'm thinking this.
- Yeah.

92
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,399
- Is that what you're wearing?
- No.

93
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:02,278
Well, you don't need to...
It's a good outfit, but no.

94
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:04,030
Oh, hold on. Your tag is out.

95
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,156
- Thank you.
- OK.

96
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,909
Oh, my God. He will see the balloons
from down the block.

97
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,786
Wait. What are you wearing, if not this?

98
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,413
- I have a thing laid out. Another outfit.
- A thing?

99
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:15,458
I have a... It's cute. I think
it's pretty cute. It's like a dress.

100
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,626
It's like a dress?

101
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,044
- It <i>is</i> a...
- Hold on.

102
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:20,505
I think maybe people
might come into your room.

103
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,215
You can fold a couple of things.

104
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,591
Is this a shirt or a dress?

105
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,095
I think if you
have to question what it is...

106
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:30,014
Don't think.
One, two, three. Shirt or dress?

107
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,642
I mean, I think it could be
either of those things.

108
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,686
If you have to ask yourself, maybe
it's not the best choice. I don't know.

109
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,146
I need to ask myself.

110
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,273
- I just... I can't...
- This is stressing you out.

111
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,357
- Hello!
- Hey!

112
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,400
- Hey.
- Hey, Dad.

113
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,277
You can see the balloons down the block.

114
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,197
I know. Will you say something to Mom?
I just can't with her right now.

115
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,157
Yeah, sure. Yeah. Is Seth here?

116
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,041
- Wait. You were supposed to get him.
- Was I?

117
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,869
- Definitely, you were.
- Hey, Cam.

118
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,329
- Hi, Gar.
- Hey.

119
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:54,956
Let's get this party started.

120
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,124
Yes.

121
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,208
Here we go.

122
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,417
Looks good.

123
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,045
Just peeling eggs.
It's actually exhausting.

124
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,047
- Hell, yeah. Thank you.
- Sure.

125
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:06,676
- I will go deal with your mother.
- Thank you.

126
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,972
Your dad is so hot.

127
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,056
OK.

128
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,182
It's true.

129
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,060
Did that, like,
make you uncomfortable growing up?

130
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,145
It was really hard.

131
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,063
It was a dress for a child.
I looked it up.

132
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,315
Hm. What the fuck is that?

133
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,859
Um... What the fuck is this?

134
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,694
- Yeah.
- It's a sign I handcrafted.

135
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:25,611
No.

136
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,946
- Respect it.
- No.

137
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,032
- Is this glue stick?
- Yeah, this is glue stick. Yeah.

138
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,661
- You can pay people to do that for you.
- You can.

139
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:36,205
- You can if you're a sucker.
- For sure, yeah.

140
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,415
I don't know.

141
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,542
Oh, my gosh.

142
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,669
OK. You guys, Jack made it to drinks.

143
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:44,213
- Good
- Yes.

144
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,673
You guys don't think he knows?

145
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,049
- Yeah.
- No.

146
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,427
Yeah, I know that he doesn't know.

147
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,095
- Right, he better not know.
- Uh-uh.

148
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:56,350
I am dying to see
his cute fucking face when...

149
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:00,104
I can't even. I mean, I can't <i>even.</i>
In my heart, I can't.

150
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,481
Fucking face.

151
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,691
The fireworks. It's going to be...

152
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:05,526
- It's almost too much.
- It is.

153
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,736
It is almost too much.

154
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,946
OK. All right. OK.
I'm going to go get the cake.

155
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,990
- I can do that.
- No, I'm going to get the cake.

156
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:12,408
Then I'm going to get the tacos

157
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,702
before my mom starts telling me
everyone will starve.

158
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:15,786
- OK.
- OK.

159
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,206
Please stop eating everything.

160
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,624
This is a tiered thing.

161
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:23,044
- I worked hard on making these color...
- You're losing your mind. Go.

162
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:26,130
- Remove yourself from the premises.
- We love you. Go!

163
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,883
- Call me if you need anything.
- Have fun. We are covered.

164
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,010
- She's freaking out.
- You're stressing her out.

165
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,261
I ate <i>one</i> of these.

166
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,973
- Can you peel or...
- Have you tasted these?

167
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,683
- Put that away.
- Will you taste it?

168
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,668
<i>Chapter two.</i>

169
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,172

170
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,219

171
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:18,641

before you travel.</i>

172
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,902
- Lost one.
- Yeah, it was my fault.

173
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,572
My fault. My fault. I got excited.

174
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,781
OK.

175
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:34,991
It's OK.

176
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,077
Katie, I hope you have
more food than this.

177
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,745
Your friends are going to starve.

178
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,455
Yeah, Ma, I'm going.

179
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,499
And get your brother
for me on the way.

180
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,414
Ding-dong!

181
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,833
I'll be right there.

182
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,837
All right. Got your backpack? Your shoes?

183
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,130
Have you got your shoes?

184
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,469
My balloons.

185
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,978
I forgot my red balloon and my blue one.

186
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,481
I have two balloons.

187
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,816
Two red ones...

188
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,277
- Yeah?
- ...and two blue.

189
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,113
- Can you go get them?
- Are you OK?

190
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:57,907
Yeah.

191
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:05,539
Keep that there, and give you this guy.

192
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,418
Oh, yeah.

193
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,003
Kitty cat.

194
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,882
This fucking thing just, like...

195
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,802
It's... It's a normal seat belt.

196
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:20,554
- Just click it in.
- Maybe you could come back and help me.

197
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,139
I don't know why you're in the front.

198
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,343
- Sorry.
- Yeah. Meow!

199
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,451
I just can't get this. I need more slack.

- OK. Are you in?

205
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,993
Can you say "Aunt Katie is incompetent"?

206
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,871
- Can... Can you say "incompetent"?
- Incompetent.

207
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,623
Yeah, that's my girl.

208
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,125
- That's not good.
- Incompetent.

209
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,794
- Exactly.
- No, that's not a good thing to teach her.

210
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,463
Incompetent.

<i>How old is Jack?</i>

212
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,136
He's thirty...

213
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,929
- Thirty-six.
- ...six.

214
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,305
He is a grown man.

215
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,600
Yeah, you're throwing a 36-year-old
grown man a surprise party. That's...

216
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:07,977
It's supposed to be funny.

217
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,940
- Yeah.
- And it's going to be. It's... Yeah, it's going to be hilarious.

218
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,483
Great idea, and it's going to be executed.

219
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,239
What's uh... What's this?

220
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,074
Oh, Jack needs paper towels.

221
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:26,328
Man, Jack is such a... B-minus.

222
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,247
He's a B-minus?

223
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,458
Then you're definitely a D.

224
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,127
I would rather be a D
than a fucking B-minus.

225
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,129
OK, I'm going to just ignore you now.

226

- Oh, that's perfect. Great.

228
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,042

229
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,212
No, I've... I've got this.

230
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,214
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

231
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,466
All right.

232
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:21,592
Come here. Come here.

233
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,844
Why don't you hold on to me?

234
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,514
Hold on to me. We're going to go.
Yeah, that's perfect.

235
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,474
OK, here we go.

236

Um...

241
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:55,000
Mom sent Ella a truck, and I guess
you didn't call her to thank her for it.

242
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:58,087
- OK.
- Well, it's because you didn't get it.

243
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,255
You didn't open it.

244
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,173
OK.

245
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,678
Well, you stopped opening
your mail last time, too.

248
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,526
Just show me your arm.

249
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,779
- No.
- Just show me your arm.

250
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:24,864
Can we not do this?

251
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,907
- Seth, just show me.
- There's nothing to see.

252
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,993
Then we'll just go to my house,
go to the party.

253
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,876
- This fucking hurts my feelings.
- Just show me and we go to my house.

254
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:32,955
Can you trust me?

255
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,956
How did this happen again?

256
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,653
It's hard. It's OK.

257
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,216
It's OK.

- That's very sweet of you to say.
- Yeah, it brought down the house.

316
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,977
You should develop that into,
like, a longer act.

317
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,146
With your encouragement, I might.

318
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,023
This actually is a pretty long act.

319
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,691
You've got at least...

320
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:33,570
what is it, a couple of years' worth
of material here, right?

321
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,323
You're making me feel so warm right now.

322
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,117
Yeah, that's my job.

323
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,202
Hey, girlie.

324
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,204
- Come here. Let me unbuckle you.
- Kitty cat.

325
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,665
All right, let's go.

326
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,416
Have you got your bunny?

327
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,669
All right, out.

328
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:52,172
Out, out, out. OK. Shut the door.

329
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,007
OK.

330
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,135
Just be careful
before the car comes.

331
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,595
OK, yeah.
Before the car comes, huh?

332
00:18:58,679 --> 00:18:59,847
Just be careful.

333
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,642
Still looks like a crack house.

334
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,937
Well, you'll fit right in, right?

335
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,189
Funny.

336
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,496
Wait, wait, wait. She needs shoes.

337
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,373
She's fine.

338
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:29,042
Just... Just give me the keys.
It will take two seconds.

339
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,252
I'll hold her.

340
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,713
Come on. I'm not going anywhere.
I'm just going to the car.

341
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:36,842
- I'll hold her. You don't need to go.
- Katie, it's... OK. All right, calm down.

342
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:39,553
Don't tell me to calm down.
That's the worst thing you could say.

343
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,054
Don't make a thing of this, please.

344
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,598
I just think it's insane

345
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:46,268
that you picked this moment,
of all moments, to be a parent.

346
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,519
And it's actually...

347
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,063
It's <i>actually</i> insane.

348
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:53,066
I don't understand why you get so pissed
about the dumbest shit.

349
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,860
- What did you just say to me?
- Nothing.

350
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:56,945
- Hello.
- Hi.

351
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,907
Hi. Um... Your insurance card?

352
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,950
Can I help you?

353
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,660
Yeah. Um... Can we come inside?

354
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,120
I need some information first.

355
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,039
- Who's the patient?
- Me.

356
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:10,584
- Have you been here before?
- Um... You bet he has.

357
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,920
And what are you detoxing from?

358
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,679
- I knew I should have dropped her off.
- It's fine. Just give her to me.

359
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,471
- OK.
- Come here, baby. Come here.

360
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,181
OK. Um...

361
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,267
- Well...
- We'll be... We'll be right here.

362
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,352
OK.

363
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:55,921
- Ma'am?
- Yeah.

364
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,966
Um... He's on heroin.

365
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,135
- What kind of insurance does he have?
- Um... Anthem.

366
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:05,097
Unfortunately, we don't take Anthem.

367
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,765
But he's been here before.

368
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,226
Does he have a new job
since the last time?

369
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,020
Yeah.

370
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,232
Then we probably took
his last job's insurance.

371
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:18,151
OK, but you can still admit him, right?

372
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,362
We have an outpatient program.

373
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,992
No, he needs to be in
for ten days for it to work.

374
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:25,909
OK.

375
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,578
Not that it's never worked, but um...

376
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:30,914
I can admit him if you want to pay cash.

377
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:35,043
- How much is it?
- It's $5,000 for the ten-day program.

378
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,380
OK, just give me a minute.

379
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,304
Credit card.
They don't take your insurance.

380
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,055
But my credit's fucked. You know that.

381
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,183
Seth, tell me
what to do right now.

382
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,105
Can you pay for it?

383
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,485
You still owe me five grand
from last time.

384
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,904
How long have you waited
to play that card?

385
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,628
- That's what I'm doing.
- I bet you think about that all the time.

386
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,076
- Every once in a while...
- All you fucking people, man.

387
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,288
- Who?
- Who? You, Mom, Dad. It's like...

388
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:14,041
- Yeah, that's so lovely.
- There are always strings attached.

389
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,417
- Strings attached?!
- Gross.

390
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,627
The string attached
is that you stay fucking clean,

391
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,212
not that you achieve greatness.

392
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,672
OK, OK.

393
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,050
The bar is so low that there's not a bar.

394
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,843
It's just, like, the ground, so...

395
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,142
Why don't you ask Jack?

396
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:37,022
You want me to ask my boyfriend
to pay for your detox?

397
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,315
I don't know.

398
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,860
Who are you?

399
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:43,070
I'm a piece of shit.

400
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,447
Ma'am? Yeah.

401
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:48,992
Oh, hey, hey, hey!

402
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,619
Hey, hey, hey! Stop, stop, stop!

403
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,497
We need to go get the cat.

404
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,709
No, no, no!

405
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,586
Told you she needed fucking shoes.

406
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,421
- Ma'am?
- Yeah.

407
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:04,257
American Group takes Anthem.
They're downtown.

408
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:06,593
Um... OK.

409
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,943
I don't think I can go downtown right now.

410
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:14,601
I'm throwing my boyfriend
a surprise birthday party tonight.

411
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:19,564
And I'm... I-I just want you to know,
I did hear myself say that out loud.

412
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,274
So...

413
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,946
Did you want me to call American,
let them know you're coming?

414
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:28,782
- OK, Tammy, right?
- Mm-hm.

415
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:32,410
OK, so you're just going to take him to
one location. That's it, OK? Don't stop.

416
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,913
I just...
I can't stress how important that is, OK?

417
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:38,436
I'm sorry. She talks like that to everyone.
I'm really sorry I'm not taking you myself.

418
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,842
- I know you don't care, but this party...
- No, I really don't.

419
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:51,596
OK.

420
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,265
- Do you want to say goodbye?
- Goodbye.

421
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:54,516
OK, go and say goodbye.

422
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,644
Hey. Hey, monkey.

423
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,271
Hey.

424
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:02,858
Daddy's just feeling a little sick,
but I'm going to go get better, OK?

425
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:04,776
Hey.

426
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,987
I love you more than the whole wide world.

427
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,531
Can I get a kiss? Can I get a kiss?

428
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,283
Thanks, sweetheart.

429
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,451
Can I give you kisses?

430
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:17,455
OK.

431
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:25,213
So...

432
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,759
All right, can we... Let's go. Can we go?

433
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,847
Hi.

434
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,223
What the fuck took so long?

435
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,391
Where's the cake?

436
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:39,603
OK, still have to get the cake.
Can you watch Ella? She's in the car.

437
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:42,856
- Your phone is ringing.
- You're not meant to leave babies in cars.

438
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:44,858
She's sleeping, it's fine. I got it.

439
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:47,194
- All right. Where's Seth?
- He stayed home.

440
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,112
- Your phone is still ringing.
- I've got it.

441
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,156
- I'll just take it.
- I have it. I've got it.

442
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,240
OK. All right.

443
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,735
<i>Chapter three.</i>

444
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,156
<i>You're here again.</i>

445
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,955
<i>You board the same boat.</i>

446
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:47,963
<i>Admit to yourself that you do not know
how to drive this boat.</i>

447
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:03,103
<i>Tell yourself you are the only person
who can drive this boat.</i>

448
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,985
<i>Now push off... and paddle.</i>

449
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:14,905
Oh!

450
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,491
You look good.

451
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:17,575
Thank you. Better.

452
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:21,496
OK.

453
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:23,123
That was so close.

454
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,083
So close.

455
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,088
- Oh, is that Ella?
- She's asleep.

456
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,923
- She's napping.
- Where's Seth?

457
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:35,468
Um... He went home. Yeah. He had to...
Can you just give me one second, please?

458
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:38,112
- OK. Are you getting the cake?
- Yeah, I'm going to grab it now.

459
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,556
- So just take her with you.
- OK.

460
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:42,392
- She's passed out.
- Sorry, can you say that one more time?

461
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:46,146
- Yeah, it's fine.
- Yeah, let's just get a drink.

462
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:47,522
It's fine.

463
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:49,399
Everything's OK, though, right?

464
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,444
- Well, did she say where he went?
- Yeah.

465
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,824
<i>You are on the fastest route
to American Drug Rehab Center.</i>

466
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:04,581
<i>In 100 feet,
turn right onto Santa Monica Boulevard.</i>

467
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:18,428
<i>You are on the same boat.</i>

468
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:21,598
<i>Keep right.</i>

00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,559

00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,584
Does she need to be changed?

631
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:21,669
Yeah. Oh.

632
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,675
Picking up? Last name?

633
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,260
Um... No. Uh...

634
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:35,808
I need to buy one needle...

635
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:38,477
and everything that comes with it...

636
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:40,104
please.

637
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:41,313
I don't understand.

638
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:42,398
Um...

639
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,902
Short tip, or something.

640
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,114
They come in a ten-pack.

641
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,020
That's convenient.

642
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:24,940
You having a good night?

643
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:27,651
Yeah, I'm having a great night.

644
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,862
- Seems like it.
- Yeah. Thanks so much.

645
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:56,889
One, two, three.

646
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:00,643
Can I have the bathroom key, as well?

647
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:03,395
Please?

648
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:17,201
Ma'am, I'm going to need you
to give me the key to the bathroom.

649
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:22,248
Give me the fucking key.
Give me the key to the fucking bathroom.

650
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:27,086
I'm going to need you to bring that back,
if you think you can manage that?

651
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:31,882
I'm sorry. I'll bring back the key.

652
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,808
OK, up we go. Up we go.

653
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:01,203
OK.

654
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:04,582
Hey, I'm going to change
that diaper, all right?

655
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:05,749
Come on.

656
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,334
OK, let's change this.

657
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:10,504
I don't...
That's dirty. That's dirty.

658
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:11,755
Yeah, that's dirty.

659
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:13,674
OK.

660
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:14,800
OK.

661
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:16,093
OK.

662
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:17,553
Do you think... OK.

663
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:20,723
I can't do that, right? I can't do that.

664
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:24,310
Could we change your diaper standing up?

665
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:25,728
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

666
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:28,606
OK.

667
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:30,941
We want to take that.

668
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:36,447
OK. Ready? Let's take it off.

669
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,032
Here we go. OK.

670
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:45,289
OK. OK.

671
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,961
I'm going to throw it away.
Hold this up.

672
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,212
Stand right there.

673
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:57,468
Oh!

674
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:58,636
Oh, my goodness.

675
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:01,013
OK. OK.

676
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,766
Here we go. Here we go.

677
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:10,731
Come back here.

678
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:12,900
OK, let's put this on.

679
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,152
Here we go, here we go, here we go.

680
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,577
OK, look at me. OK.

681
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:28,290
It's OK. It's OK.

682
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,461
Ready?

683
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:34,546
Hold the bunny up. Hold the bunny up.

684
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,340
Don't want to get the bunny messy.

685
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,175
OK.

686
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:40,678
I know what I'm doing.

687
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,971
OK. There we go.

688
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:44,682
We got it, right?

689
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:45,808
Do we got it?

690
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:47,309
Do we got it?

691
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:49,103
Yeah, hold that up.

692
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:53,816
OK.

693
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:56,068
Here we go. Up on here.

694
00:44:58,404 --> 00:44:59,613
All right.

695
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:00,697
OK.

696
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:04,785
Please don't do too much.

697
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,332
Only stupid people OD.

698
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:13,669
Great. That's great.

699
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:16,964
OK, wipe this off.

700
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:18,966
OK.

701
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,975
I'm going take them off real quick, OK?

702
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,313
OK. We're just going to...

703
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,244
Oh, gosh!

704
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,121
In there.

705
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:47,763
Are you OK?

706
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:51,850
You're OK.

707
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:09,076
Is that a little monkey I hear?

708
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:12,579
How did a cute little monkey
sneak in here?

709
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:16,166
I got... shit everywhere.

710
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:20,087
We don't care about
no stinky poop, do we?

711
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,965
We <i>love</i> poop, don't we?

712
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:25,634
You want to climb on the tree?
You want to climb on the tree?

713
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:27,177
<i>♪ We love poop ♪</i>

714
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,179
<i>♪ Yes, yes, we do ♪</i>

715
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,640
<i>♪ We would eat it all the time
If you let us... ♪</i>

716
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:33,976
What are you doing?
Seth, what are you doing?

717
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:35,310
Seth, what are you doing?

718
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:36,812
Stop.

719
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:39,273
Seth, stop.

720
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,275
Daddy hurt his hand.
Can you kiss it?

721
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,193
Can you kiss it? Thank you.

722
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,950
Do you know what time it is?
Put your arms out.

723
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:49,324
It's chopper time!

724
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:55,372
Let's chopper out!

725
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:57,708
It's time to chopper out!

726
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:01,086
Chopper out!

727
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:03,755
Chopper out!

728
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,507
Chopper out!

729
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:08,093
Chopper landing.

730
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:11,597
Let's go. Let's go. We want to play.

731
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:04,691
No. It's just been, like,
such a... crazy night.

732
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:05,776
Um...

733
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:09,821
The cake took so long, and we got a flat.

734
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,198
I'm going to eat them.

735
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:15,410
He bit me!

736
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:17,412
Hold on, sweetie.
I can't hear you.

737
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:18,997
You've got to bite him back!

738
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:20,874
- You've got to bite him!
- I love you, too.

739
00:49:20,957 --> 00:49:23,418
- Save us, quickly!
- No, I'll be home really, really soon.

740
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:25,962
Yes, you bit his head off!

741
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:28,090
You saved humanity!

742
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:29,424
Oh, my gosh!

743
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:30,801
You're my hero.

744
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:32,844
You're my hero, you know that?

745
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:38,308
Oh, shit.

746
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:39,810
What?

747
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:44,106
OK, you've got to...
you've got to promise not to kill me.

748
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:46,191
What?

749
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:54,491
Are you fucking kidding me?

750
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:57,911
- Are you fucking kidding me right now?
- I don't want it. You take it.

751
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:02,040
I'm sure she'll be very happy to see you.

752
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:03,709
Fuck you.

753
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:06,336
Language! There's a child present.

754
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,100
Oh, no.

755
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:23,145
Uh-uh.

756
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,856
- I have the key.
- I don't care.

757
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:28,984
She's going to get in so much trouble.

758
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:31,737
You don't want me
to just hand you the key right now?

759
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,780
No, because we're closed right now.

760
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,157
Are you fucking kidding me?

761
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,075
No, I'm not kidding you. You can go now.

762
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:40,620
They locked the door. They locked
her out. She is not going to be happy.

763
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:47,210
Oh, sh... Yes.

764
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:49,463
Yes! Let's go! Let's go!

765
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:53,383
Chopper out! Chopper out! Let's go!

766
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:55,969
I got you.

767
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:57,888
OK. Oh, fuck!

768
00:50:57,971 --> 00:51:00,182
That's right. That's right.
We are choppers.

769
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:01,975
- Go! Go!
- Put your seat belt on!

770
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,103
Oh!

771
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:06,563
Shit!

772
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:10,066
Oh! Drive! Just fucking drive!

773
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,818
- You're a mess! Go!
- OK, OK, OK!

774
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,115
Chopper out!

775
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:24,498
Hey.

776
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:27,626
- She's fine.
- Oh, you got through?

777
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:30,128
- Did you talk to her?
- She's with Seth, and she's fine.

778
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:31,963
Oh. Oh.

779
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:37,219
- She told me he went home.
- Don't do this. Don't.

780
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:40,180
- Can you call her back?
- No, don't make him call her back.

781
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:42,641
- She sounded fine.
- I want to hear the sound of her voice.

782
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:44,059
Please, just call her back.

783
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:49,397
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

784
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:59,950
Dad was, like,
driving 90 miles an hour up the five,

785
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:03,620
and I had to stick my head
out the window to puke.

786
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:06,289
You really don't remember?
This was, like, a big moment.

787
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:07,874
I don't think so. Keep going.

788
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,919
So I puke out the window
and everything just...

789
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:12,170
Comes back on the car?

790
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:15,882
Came back on the whole side of
the car, and they couldn't see anything.

791
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:16,967
Oh, yeah.

792
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:19,094
We get to Santa Barbara
and Dad gets out.

793
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:20,428
He was fucking pissed.

794
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:23,098
"Who the fuck puked
all over the side of my car?"

795
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:29,229
I just don't understand how he thought
someone else puked on his car.

796
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,234
Dad always says
the exact same thing.

797
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:35,861
What?

798
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,738
You know. Think about it.

799
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,076
All right, yeah.

800
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:47,205
"Suck it up,
walk it off, grow a pair."

801
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:49,791
And then let them dangle.

802
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:51,751
I don't remember that part.

803
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,503
I think that's a new addition.

804
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:54,588
Maybe.

805
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:58,758
Dad doesn't joke
with me any more. It's weird.

806
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:02,137
<i>In 1.3 miles,

807

<i>then merge onto CA 110 North
towards Pasadena.</i>

808
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:08,935
I know what Mom will say, too.

809
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:10,770
What?

810
00:53:12,647 --> 00:53:14,232
She'll tell me I broke her heart.

811
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:17,527
She really loves to tell me that.

812
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:25,744
Hey, Ella.

813
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:27,954
You want to see monkey brain?

814
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:30,498
Bleugh!

815
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:33,168
Like that monkey brain?

816
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:39,966
A kitty! A kitty!

817
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:43,136
A cheetah.

818
00:53:53,229 --> 00:53:54,709
I think I can do it this time.

819
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,568
It feels different, you know?

820
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:00,487
Yeah.

821
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:06,076
I know what I've got to do
and I'm just going to do it.

822

<i>In 200 feet, keep left.</i>

823
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:19,839
Oh, look, they're right over my house.
Have you ever been over on the fourth?

824
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:21,800
No, I don't think so.

825
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:23,468

826
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:24,970

827
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:29,849
Should we go check them out?

828
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:33,061
Let's do it. It will be fun.
Come on, let's do it.

829
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:35,355
Come on, let's go check them out,

830
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:38,066
and then... and then we can go
to that place in Pasadena.

831
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:41,277
- I really don't think it's a good idea.
- It's not going to make a difference.

832
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:42,612
I'll be fine. I promise.

833
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:51,246

- Really, really. Yeah, I swear.

834
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:56,793

We're going to see fireworks, baby!

838
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:07,679
Yes! Let's go eat those fireworks.

839
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:09,514
I'm sick of fries and burger.

840
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:11,641
I want fireworks.

841
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:14,102
Oh! I'm going to eat a pink one...

842
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:15,895
and a blue one,

843
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:18,356

in the fireworks.

So, what, is he high right now, or...?

892
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:03,141
- Why did you ask me if you already knew?
