00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:28,921
I mean, you know

166
00:09:28,932 --> 00:09:31,983
it's, it's a long shot
obviously, but --

167
00:09:32,054 --> 00:09:33,202
Right.

168
00:09:33,762 --> 00:09:36,143
I went by the public school
that we are zoned for now

169
00:09:36,154 --> 00:09:38,915
and it's not great, honestly.

170
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:40,407
The classrooms are overcrowded.

171
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:43,272
I'm just worried
he could get totally lost.

172
00:09:43,306 --> 00:09:46,538
I -- I know we've always said
we're not those parents.

173
00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:48,789
- But I don't know, maybe?
- Well, we can't afford to be.

174

- Greg. Greg!
- Relax!

175
00:09:52,229 --> 00:09:53,572
Anyway..

176
00:09:54,732 --> 00:09:57,424
You know, she said we should
at least try a few privates

177
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:59,806
along with
the magnet programs, so..

178
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,452
I was hoping you could
help me brainstorm.

179
00:10:01,462 --> 00:10:03,603
- Tonight?
- You're so much better at this.

180
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:05,353
- Well, I'm not better at this than you.
- No, no, no, you are.

181
00:10:05,363 --> 00:10:07,917
- Everything I write sounds so cloying.
- Alex..

182
00:10:09,507 --> 00:10:11,164
Is there a prompt?

183
00:10:11,276 --> 00:10:12,697
Oh, you know.

Okay, okay.
Is there an actual prompt?

187

Uh.. Let's see.

188
00:10:23,381 --> 00:10:24,899
All right.

That's exactly the kind of thing

195

that sounds
like parent bullshit.

But that is not bullshit!

babies don't typically

do that for days, at least.

- Yeah.

00:11:16,537 --> 00:11:17,953
I've always said

214
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:20,390
the more attention we pay now

215
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:22,751
the more we really listen

216
00:11:22,831 --> 00:11:25,868
the more engaged and confident
they'll be.

217
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:28,088
Not just in school,
but their whole lives.

218
00:11:28,342 --> 00:11:30,241
Which is why it is so important

219
00:11:30,275 --> 00:11:32,719
to create a preschool atmosphere

220
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,821
where children
are encouraged to be

221

their truest,
most authentic selves.

222
00:11:37,662 --> 00:11:40,458
At this age, that's really
the most important thing.

223
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:43,899
Yeah, but they're just
playing all day, right?

224
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,946
I mean, basically,
what you've got here

00:11:45,981 --> 00:11:48,086
is a, a well-funded playroom.

Well..

Uh, the truth is

228
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,886
uh, creativity and imagination
are both foundational

for all types
of higher learning.

230

A colleague of mine
wrote a great book

on the subject,
if you're interested.

I get it.

No -- no. M -- maybe this is
not even worth it.

- Really?

Yes.

244
00:12:32,924 --> 00:12:34,132
There's only one thing --

245
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:36,341
No, of course.
I mean, you must have notes.

246
00:12:36,376 --> 00:12:39,714
You talk about his imagination,
which is great

247
00:12:39,776 --> 00:12:41,827
since that's really
the best indicator.

248
00:12:41,838 --> 00:12:43,805
Why not use that as a lead-in

249
00:12:43,832 --> 00:12:46,627
to talk a little about
his gender expansive play.

250
00:12:49,082 --> 00:12:50,737
But anecdotes.

251
00:12:51,038 --> 00:12:52,626
So you mean, like..

252
00:12:53,591 --> 00:12:55,524
It could be anything, really.

253
00:12:55,699 --> 00:12:57,972
I was in his classroom
on Tuesday

254
00:12:57,984 --> 00:13:00,800
and he, and Emily, and Michelle

255
00:13:01,015 --> 00:13:03,979
were creating
their own fairy tale

256
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,681
this enchanted forest.

257
00:13:05,715 --> 00:13:08,373
And they'd made trees

258
00:13:08,408 --> 00:13:10,168
out of chairs and pillows

259
00:13:10,203 --> 00:13:11,860
and, and Jake..

260
00:13:11,894 --> 00:13:13,839
Jake was this princess

261
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,437
who didn't know
she was a princess.

262
00:13:15,448 --> 00:13:18,934
And Emily was the witch
who was keeping her locked up

263
00:13:18,945 --> 00:13:23,190
and Michelle was somebody's
helper or something, but..

264
00:13:24,665 --> 00:13:26,564
Anyway, it was really Jake..

265
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,912
...who was the ringleader.

266
00:13:29,947 --> 00:13:32,397
You -- you think talking
about that would..

267
00:13:32,432 --> 00:13:33,699
I -- I mean,
I'm -- I'm sure you're right

268
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:35,780
I just wanna make sure
that I understand.

269
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,679
Well, for one thing,
someone's gonna read this

270
00:13:38,714 --> 00:13:40,267
and then
they're gonna meet Jake.

271
00:13:40,302 --> 00:13:42,545
And it is always a good sign

272
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,893
when parents seem to really
know their kids

273
00:13:44,927 --> 00:13:46,584
which, of course, you do.

274
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:48,758
- Right.
- But there's sort of a..

275
00:13:48,793 --> 00:13:52,417
A big part of his personality
that you don't even mention.

276
00:13:52,452 --> 00:13:53,407
Right?

277
00:13:54,156 --> 00:13:55,445
Here's the second thing.

278
00:13:55,558 --> 00:13:57,284
The numbers are ridiculous.

279
00:13:57,319 --> 00:13:59,657
Especially when it
comes to which families

280
00:13:59,668 --> 00:14:01,590
they're gonna help financially.

281
00:14:02,082 --> 00:14:03,766
But what you have to remember is

282
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:05,468
everybody wants diversity.

283
00:14:06,272 --> 00:14:07,825
Mm-hmm.

284
00:14:07,985 --> 00:14:10,504
Let's be honest, Jake..

285
00:14:11,781 --> 00:14:14,301
...he's, he's very special.

286

And believe me, this is the part
of my job I hate the most

this, this strategizing.

288
00:14:19,402 --> 00:14:20,887
But I really think that

289
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,411
this is a card you could play.

290
00:14:24,518 --> 00:14:25,876
That's all.

291
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,337
Not to mention, you want him
to be somewhere

292
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,041
he can thrive, right?

00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,720
- I got it. This is all Jake.
- Are you sure?

324
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,042
- Yes.
- Let me take that.

325
00:15:40,077 --> 00:15:41,616
Thank you. Okay, bye.

326
00:15:41,673 --> 00:15:43,778
Sanjay, come on!
Mommy's had a long day.

327
00:15:43,789 --> 00:15:46,827
- He can't, he can't leave.
- I have to do this first.

328
00:15:59,403 --> 00:16:01,647
You really don't think
it's weird?

329
00:16:01,658 --> 00:16:02,798
About Judy?

330
00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:06,551
I don't know.

331
00:16:06,586 --> 00:16:10,596
I mean, she was strategizing,
right?

332
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:12,443
Yeah, no.
The strategizing, I get.

333
00:16:12,454 --> 00:16:13,627
But the way she was talking

334
00:16:13,662 --> 00:16:15,043
it was just a little..

335
00:16:16,492 --> 00:16:18,115
I don't know.

336
00:16:21,877 --> 00:16:24,017
I mean, he does like to play
dress-up.

337
00:16:24,052 --> 00:16:25,605
That's not news.

338
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:27,020
Not that I care, obviously

339
00:16:27,031 --> 00:16:31,096
but he's not exactly
Johnny Basketball.

340
00:16:31,107 --> 00:16:32,453
Johnny what?

341
00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:33,752
You know.

342
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:35,647
That's not an expression.

343
00:16:35,658 --> 00:16:38,143
I know it's not,
I'm just saying.

I have a break around noon.

- Hi, Greg.
- Hey, listen, um..

352
00:17:20,151 --> 00:17:21,393
I've been meaning to mention

353
00:17:21,406 --> 00:17:22,638
and maybe
you've already noticed it

354
00:17:22,649 --> 00:17:25,238
but the walls here
are a little..

355
00:17:28,793 --> 00:17:31,865
And I.. Most of my patients,
they're pretty tame.

00:17:31,876 --> 00:17:34,879
But you know, if you ever,
if there's a noise issue, or..

357
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:38,737
Oh! You're so sweet!
I haven't even noticed.

358
00:17:38,748 --> 00:17:40,815
Oh, and I wouldn't want you
to worry about that.

359
00:17:40,834 --> 00:17:42,767
I know, in my own work

360
00:17:42,778 --> 00:17:45,884
how important vocalizing can be.

361
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,971
I find it's so helpful
in releasing

362
00:17:47,982 --> 00:17:50,053
all kinds of emotional build-up.

363
00:17:50,064 --> 00:17:52,135
I'm sure you're familiar
with Arthur Janov?

364
00:17:54,816 --> 00:17:56,542
It's scream therapy.

365
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:57,668
It's what?

366
00:17:57,735 --> 00:17:59,116
It.. Janov.

367
00:17:59,181 --> 00:18:01,597
He was big in the '60s,
it was all about

368
00:18:01,632 --> 00:18:05,014
finding your primal scream
and releasing it into the world.

369

Jesus.

370
00:18:06,825 --> 00:18:08,500
Yeah, and apparently this is,
like, her niche, you know.

371
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,409
So, which means
this is not going to stop.

372
00:18:12,263 --> 00:18:15,226
- Hello?
- Yeah, sorry. I just..

373
00:18:15,651 --> 00:18:18,723
It's not his personality.
I think that's what bugged me.

374
00:18:18,734 --> 00:18:19,873
What?

375
00:18:20,047 --> 00:18:21,566
About Judy, she, she was acting

376
00:18:21,617 --> 00:18:22,963
like I'd failed to mention

377
00:18:22,998 --> 00:18:25,173
some deep-seated part of him,
and it's like..

378
00:18:25,207 --> 00:18:26,829
Yeah, he likes fairy tales

379
00:18:26,864 --> 00:18:29,867
but maybe that's not the most
critical thing worth mentioning.

380
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:32,697
He knows all 50 states,
he's already started reading.

381
00:18:32,732 --> 00:18:34,389
How many kids his age
are reading?

Hey, Ally, Ally,
okay, I love you

383

but I think
that you're fixating.

384
00:18:38,427 --> 00:18:40,947
No, I'm not fixating! I just
think he should get a clean slate.

385
00:18:40,981 --> 00:18:43,743
I don't wanna send him off
to kindergarten labeled as --

I don't think anyone's
trying to label him.

You know, Ally, Judy loves Jake.
Judy loves you.

She's on your side, all right?

That's actually not that bad.

But that's just an idea.
We don't have to..

00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,026
- I don't know.
- I can't deal with this..

485
00:24:09,037 --> 00:24:10,107
There.

486
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,195
Right?

487
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,454
[music continues]

488
00:24:28,743 --> 00:24:30,987
I mean, it's insane!

489
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:36,526
Between the down-regs
and the stims

490
00:24:36,716 --> 00:24:39,013
trigger shots, blood samples

491
00:24:39,024 --> 00:24:41,855
not to mention anesthetic
for egg retrieval.

492
00:24:41,997 --> 00:24:44,344
All in all,
you're probably stabbed

493
00:24:44,379 --> 00:24:47,045
about 75 times per cycle.

494
00:24:47,447 --> 00:24:50,208
And most of the stabbing,
you're doing to yourself.

495
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,840
I had this whole kit
at the office.

496
00:24:53,008 --> 00:24:54,941
They say if you're squeamish
about needles

497
00:24:54,976 --> 00:24:57,944
IVF will either cure you
or break you.

498
00:24:58,527 --> 00:25:00,011
I, actually..

499
00:25:00,084 --> 00:25:02,431
[muffled screaming]

500
00:25:03,881 --> 00:25:05,456
That doesn't bother you?

501
00:25:05,467 --> 00:25:08,441
- You mean..
- The banshee next door.

502
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,444
[sighs]

503
00:25:17,713 --> 00:25:19,197
What about Ben?

504
00:25:19,256 --> 00:25:20,533
What about him?

505
00:25:20,795 --> 00:25:22,451
Was he supportive?

506
00:25:22,486 --> 00:25:24,823
Just.. In all this.

507
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:27,042
[sighs]

508
00:25:27,077 --> 00:25:28,665
We've got a few minutes.

509
00:25:30,202 --> 00:25:31,618
He'd call the office.

510
00:25:32,634 --> 00:25:34,360
Constantly checking in.

511
00:25:35,141 --> 00:25:37,536
You know, he'd e-mail me
these fertility blogs.

512
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:39,089
What to eat, what not to eat.

513
00:25:39,123 --> 00:25:40,711
That sounds like
a lot of pressure.

514
00:25:41,712 --> 00:25:42,989
You have kids?

515
00:25:44,094 --> 00:25:45,371
Yeah. One.

516
00:25:46,447 --> 00:25:49,553
It's like when guys say,
"We're pregnant!"

517
00:25:49,736 --> 00:25:51,151
You know?

518
00:25:51,303 --> 00:25:54,962
Like, wow! Equality, great!

519
00:25:55,036 --> 00:25:57,625
But actually you're not,
so maybe you could just..

520
00:25:58,845 --> 00:26:00,260
...fuck off a little bit?

521
00:26:04,336 --> 00:26:07,788
Ally, come on,
you're being ridiculous.

522
00:26:07,862 --> 00:26:09,795
I'm fine.
You've got clients.

523
00:26:09,947 --> 00:26:12,881
So, what?
So, I'll reschedule.

524
00:26:12,916 --> 00:26:15,021
It's his first interview.
This is important.

525
00:26:15,056 --> 00:26:16,575
- He's gonna be nervous.
- Exactly.

526
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:17,704
You know, I'm sorry,
but what happens

527
00:26:17,714 --> 00:26:19,094
if you puke on the train?

528
00:26:19,129 --> 00:26:20,993
You think that's gonna put him
in a good mood?

529
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:24,444
All right, th -- there's
some apple slices

530
00:26:24,479 --> 00:26:25,504
with peanut butter
in the kitchen.

531
00:26:25,514 --> 00:26:26,644
Make sure he eats on the way.

532
00:26:26,654 --> 00:26:28,172
[Jake humming]

533
00:26:29,864 --> 00:26:31,624
Yeah, but "The Little Mermaid's"

534
00:26:31,659 --> 00:26:33,592
my favorite movie.

535
00:26:33,626 --> 00:26:34,626
Mm-hmm.

536
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:43,912
- Here you go.
- Thank you very much.

537
00:26:43,947 --> 00:26:45,845
Hey, Jake, let's go over here.

538
00:26:52,035 --> 00:26:53,139
First time?

539
00:26:54,698 --> 00:26:55,699
Yeah.

540
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,130
At our last one,
they left the door open

541
00:26:59,235 --> 00:27:00,823
so I could peek in.

542
00:27:00,834 --> 00:27:03,035
And I saw my son
was drawing a picture

543
00:27:03,069 --> 00:27:05,658
and I thought, "That's good,
that's good," right?

544
00:27:05,693 --> 00:27:08,868
So the teacher comes over
and says, "Hey, what's that?"

545
00:27:08,903 --> 00:27:10,490
And he said, "A gun."

546
00:27:10,525 --> 00:27:12,389
[chuckles]

547
00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:16,976
Well, he can't fix America, huh?

548
00:27:16,987 --> 00:27:18,954
No, he can't.

549
00:27:20,553 --> 00:27:21,692
Mr. Wheeler?

550
00:27:22,748 --> 00:27:24,197
Can I have a word with you?

551
00:27:27,884 --> 00:27:29,615
Alexandra, it's your mother.

552
00:27:29,626 --> 00:27:32,079
I haven't heard from you
in over a week.

553
00:27:32,098 --> 00:27:33,686
Call me old-fashioned,
but I don't think

554
00:27:33,721 --> 00:27:36,313
a simple phone call
is so much to ask.

555
00:27:36,324 --> 00:27:38,292
An emoji does not count.

556
00:27:38,432 --> 00:27:40,607
In any case, listen,
I just talked to your brother

557
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,061
and Kimmie's got
a piano recital on the 11th.

558
00:27:43,144 --> 00:27:45,318
I don't know if you've
heard her play recently

559
00:27:45,353 --> 00:27:48,356
but she's really getting
very good.

560
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:51,014
It's amazing, frankly,
the discipline at her age.

561
00:27:51,048 --> 00:27:53,154
I thought it might be nice
for Jake to see.

562
00:27:53,188 --> 00:27:55,087
It might inspire him.
Who knows?

563
00:27:55,121 --> 00:27:57,986
Oh, have you set a date
for his birthday party yet?

564
00:27:58,021 --> 00:28:00,215
I don't want a situation
like last year.

565
00:28:00,226 --> 00:28:03,057
It really broke my heart.
So call me, I'm at the office.

566
00:28:03,068 --> 00:28:05,346
Be here all day.
Remember what that's like?

567
00:28:23,805 --> 00:28:25,634
Of course, it's ridiculous.

568
00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:27,834
- I'm not saying it's not.
- I think "Abusive" was the word you used.

569
00:28:27,844 --> 00:28:30,709
You said whoever had the bright
idea to evaluate toddlers

570
00:28:30,743 --> 00:28:32,459
using test scores deserves
a special place in hell.

571
00:28:32,469 --> 00:28:34,091
But he got a 96!

572
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:36,680
Ou -- out of 100?

573
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:37,809
Yeah, well, I mean,
it's percentile

574
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:39,165
so you can't get higher than 99.

575
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,064
- What is all this?
- Look, look. Okay, look.

576
00:28:41,098 --> 00:28:42,859
- So they break it down. Right?
- Mm-hmm.

577
00:28:42,893 --> 00:28:44,757
There's verbal ability,
spatial relations.

578
00:28:44,792 --> 00:28:46,392
- Fine motor skills.
- Fine motor skills?

579
00:28:46,414 --> 00:28:47,439
Yeah, like how he holds
a pencil.

580
00:28:47,449 --> 00:28:48,729
And I was worried about that too

581
00:28:48,761 --> 00:28:50,477
'cause he's left-handed,
which, I mean, obviously

582
00:28:50,487 --> 00:28:51,892
they can't discriminate,
but his form --

583
00:28:51,902 --> 00:28:53,766
- You are out of your mind.
- Okay, okay, look.

584
00:28:53,801 --> 00:28:56,691
Lo -- look at the narrative.

585
00:28:57,035 --> 00:29:00,754
- "Jake was enthusiastic and curious..
- Enthusiastic.

586
00:29:00,773 --> 00:29:03,500
"And proved remarkably focused
on the task at hand.

587
00:29:03,534 --> 00:29:06,123
"With a keen eye,
he was able to group pictures

588
00:29:06,158 --> 00:29:08,850
"based on common properties
copying several rows of symbols

589
00:29:08,885 --> 00:29:10,117
- to match a code."
- What the fuck!

590
00:29:10,127 --> 00:29:12,647
But it's like shapes and things,
relax. Okay.

591
00:29:12,681 --> 00:29:14,720
Wait, wait, wait,
this is my favorite part.

592
00:29:14,731 --> 00:29:16,595
"Using an unconventional

593
00:29:16,606 --> 00:29:19,574
"but still effective
left-handed grip.

594
00:29:19,585 --> 00:29:21,966
A delight to work with."

595
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:25,512
What's wrong?

596
00:29:27,524 --> 00:29:28,663
I -- I don't understand.

597
00:29:28,697 --> 00:29:30,976
I guess Jake had made friends

598
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,771
with one of the girls
in his group

599
00:29:32,805 --> 00:29:34,842
and one of the boys overheard

600
00:29:34,876 --> 00:29:35,843
what they were talking about.

601
00:29:35,877 --> 00:29:37,672
And, uh, that boy

602
00:29:37,706 --> 00:29:39,156
told some other boy

603
00:29:39,191 --> 00:29:42,988
who told some other boy,
who started teasing Jake.

604
00:29:43,022 --> 00:29:44,852
- What were they saying?
- I don't know.

605
00:29:44,886 --> 00:29:48,027
But apparently before
the teacher could intervene

606
00:29:48,062 --> 00:29:49,339
things got physical.

607
00:29:49,373 --> 00:29:50,640
They started shoving each other.

608
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,169
- I think Jake fell down.
- Jesus.

609
00:29:52,204 --> 00:29:53,826
Yeah, and then
I guess Jake shoved

610
00:29:53,861 --> 00:29:55,379
the other kid back, I..

611
00:29:55,414 --> 00:29:56,774
And then I guess
he started crying.

612
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,510
But -- but did you tell them
he's not like that?

613
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,143
When has he ever shoved anyone?

614
00:30:00,177 --> 00:30:01,938
They knew that he was
being teased, okay?

615
00:30:01,972 --> 00:30:04,733
The man was really nice
about it. I..

616
00:30:04,768 --> 00:30:06,879
I actually think he was
a little embarrassed.

617
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,484
- Why?
- Well..

618
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,626
He kept dancing around
what had happened

619
00:30:11,637 --> 00:30:13,673
talking about
Jake's creative role-play

620
00:30:13,708 --> 00:30:16,262
or whatever, and then suddenly,
I realized

621
00:30:16,297 --> 00:30:18,122
Oh, God, this guy

622
00:30:18,145 --> 00:30:20,301
doesn't know how to tell me
that my son was

623
00:30:20,335 --> 00:30:23,649
uh, well, he was the
Little Mermaid, it turns out.

624
00:30:23,683 --> 00:30:25,478
Damn this thing.

625
00:30:25,513 --> 00:30:26,953
Anyway, once it was over,
the teacher

626
00:30:26,963 --> 00:30:28,343
she sat both of them down.

627
00:30:28,378 --> 00:30:30,483
They had a talk about
respectful behavior.

628
00:30:30,518 --> 00:30:32,727
And, uh, she encouraged
Jake to use

629
00:30:32,761 --> 00:30:34,522
his words if he was angry.

630
00:30:36,825 --> 00:30:38,146
He couldn't talk.

631
00:30:38,181 --> 00:30:39,941
- No, I guess not.
- No, no, no.

632
00:30:39,976 --> 00:30:42,116
I -- I mean, the Little Mermaid
loses her voice.

633
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,773
She can't talk
for, like, half the movie.

634
00:30:44,941 --> 00:30:46,701
Y -- you never thought of that?

635
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:50,607
Well, are you mad at me?

636
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:52,712
Well..

637
00:30:52,747 --> 00:30:54,645
Now they're gonna think
he's got anger issues

638
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,682
or doesn't know
how to communicate his feelings.

639
00:30:56,716 --> 00:30:59,167
[sighs]
I should have taken him.

640
00:30:59,202 --> 00:31:01,721
- Well, thanks.
- No, I -- I'm not saying it's your fault.

641
00:31:01,756 --> 00:31:04,138
- 'Cause it's not.
- Well, it's a red flag.

642
00:31:04,172 --> 00:31:06,519
Okay? Uh, they're looking
for anything.

643
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,246
[sighs]

644
00:31:09,281 --> 00:31:10,558
Shit.

645
00:31:12,974 --> 00:31:15,287
Now, somehow, I was a little
more concerned about Jake

646
00:31:15,321 --> 00:31:16,909
than how it might
affect his chances.

647
00:31:16,944 --> 00:31:18,869
- Excuse me?
- I just..

648
00:31:18,994 --> 00:31:20,790
Maybe we've got things
a little backwards here.

649
00:31:20,801 --> 00:31:21,904
Hey, hey, that is not fair.

650
00:31:21,914 --> 00:31:24,234
Being concerned for his chances
is being concerned for Jake.

651
00:31:24,244 --> 00:31:25,307
Yeah, I realized that.

652
00:31:25,331 --> 00:31:27,023
And frankly, if you're
worried about him

653
00:31:27,057 --> 00:31:29,094
being teased at Sibley Hall

654
00:31:29,128 --> 00:31:30,775
maybe you ought to think about
what it'd be like for him

655
00:31:30,785 --> 00:31:33,029
some place where
the teacher's got 40 kids

656
00:31:33,063 --> 00:31:34,927
crammed into a class
half the size.

657
00:31:34,962 --> 00:31:36,091
You think this won't
happen again?

658
00:31:36,101 --> 00:31:37,206
Okay, fine.

659
00:31:37,766 --> 00:31:40,079
So don't tell me
I'm not concerned about Jake.

Okay, I'm not a crazy mom, Alex.

668
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,357
I don't want to hoard him.

669
00:33:00,392 --> 00:33:02,601
I want him to have
his father in his life

670
00:33:02,635 --> 00:33:05,190
but he needs routine right now.

671
00:33:05,224 --> 00:33:07,951
- It's so important at this age.
- Of course.

672
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,022
I mean, honestly,
I shouldn't even complain.

673
00:33:10,057 --> 00:33:11,265
It's..

674
00:33:11,299 --> 00:33:15,407
It's a good thing that he wants
to be involved. I just..

675
00:33:15,441 --> 00:33:17,305
I honestly think sometimes
it's the lawyers

676
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,031
that make it all impossible.

677
00:33:20,446 --> 00:33:23,415

- No, I'm sure you're right.

- You ladies need any help?
- Yes, I do.

680
00:33:28,523 --> 00:33:30,594
I was looking at
the Power Rangers costumes

681
00:33:30,629 --> 00:33:32,251
and I couldn't see
anything in red.

682
00:33:32,286 --> 00:33:34,529
My son's like... yay high.

683
00:33:34,564 --> 00:33:36,807
We may be sold out
of that color. I can check.

684
00:33:36,842 --> 00:33:39,017
Oh, no, no, you see, it's..

685
00:33:39,051 --> 00:33:40,915
It really has to be red.

686
00:33:40,949 --> 00:33:42,606
- Okay.
- Yeah, okay.

687
00:33:43,849 --> 00:33:45,782
So, what does Jake wanna be? Hm?

688

Oh, you know Jake.

He has a different idea
every other day.

I'll just grab a few options.

00:33:53,438 --> 00:33:55,361
- Yeah, smart.
- Miss?

Oh, my God, my hero!
Yes! You found it!

00:33:59,828 --> 00:34:04,695
Hey, Teresa, can you do a price check
on baby Frankenstein kit. Thanks.

694
00:34:20,996 --> 00:34:22,859
Maybe we should explain to him

695
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:25,871
why Rapunzel's not a good idea.

696
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,527
I just think..

697
00:34:30,309 --> 00:34:33,278
What if someone says something?
Or even a funny look?

698
00:34:33,312 --> 00:34:34,762
I know.

699
00:34:37,385 --> 00:34:39,491
It is our job to protect him.

Why?
Why can't I be Rapunzel?

Did you see the pirate?
It's awesome.

707
00:35:12,765 --> 00:35:15,320
- It's got these tassels.
- No! No!

You promised me!

- Trick or treat.

I hate you!

Jake, I need you to calm down.

00:35:28,988 --> 00:35:32,337
- Your ideas are lazy!
- Just calm down for one second.

He was Ben.

He just had the face of the man
from the bodega.

723
00:36:13,094 --> 00:36:17,269
Like the man from the bodega
was playing Ben in my dream.

724
00:36:18,141 --> 00:36:18,949
Okay.

725
00:36:19,453 --> 00:36:21,964
And we get to the top
of the mountain

726
00:36:22,142 --> 00:36:25,519
and the snaps on my pack pop off

00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:28,705
and all of my gear
just falls off.

Just rolling down this ravine.

729
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:32,972
And I'm watching it go,
and I know this is bad

730
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:34,088
but for some reason

00:36:34,122 --> 00:36:36,019
I just start laughing.

732
00:36:36,731 --> 00:36:38,940
So I guess I'm wondering,
what does that mean?

733
00:36:41,509 --> 00:36:44,024
- Well, that depends.
- Yeah, I know.

734
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,607
I'm just wondering
what you think it means.

735

I mean,
just give me your two cents.

I mean,
isn't that why we're here?

I think that's less important
than your own --

Oh, my God. I'm sorry,
are you always like this?

I'm sorry. I think we should end
early today.

You're allowed to feel
frustrated.

first started coming

he would always ask me
whose side you were on.

I told him..

751

...you don't like taking sides.

I just.. I -- I got here
early today

756
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,340
so I figured I would just

757
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:29,469
I don't know, check in and see

758
00:38:29,479 --> 00:38:30,998
if there were any updates.

759
00:38:31,032 --> 00:38:33,207
The truth is, I haven't talked
to Bethany this week

760
00:38:33,241 --> 00:38:35,105
but we spoke on Friday,
and she said

761
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:38,108
that Jake had actually been
a little better.

762
00:38:38,143 --> 00:38:39,317
"Better?"

763
00:38:39,351 --> 00:38:42,320
I -- I just meant the schools.

764
00:38:42,354 --> 00:38:44,012
Oh.

765
00:38:44,047 --> 00:38:45,760
Uh, wha -- what's up
with Bethany?

766
00:38:45,771 --> 00:38:47,670
No, there were, oh

767
00:38:47,704 --> 00:38:49,913
one or two incidents in class.

768
00:38:49,948 --> 00:38:52,882
I spoke with Alex about it
briefly, over the phone.

769
00:38:53,986 --> 00:38:56,126
She didn't tell me.

770
00:38:56,161 --> 00:38:58,750
[chuckles]
Oh, here, honey. Come on in.

771
00:39:01,612 --> 00:39:03,579
It was nothing serious.

772
00:39:03,684 --> 00:39:06,652
He's always liked doing things
his own way, you know that.

773
00:39:06,664 --> 00:39:08,148
Yes.

774
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:11,059
But lately, according to Bethany

775
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:13,521
he's been a little more..

776
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:16,614
...obsessive?

777
00:39:16,766 --> 00:39:18,975
Refusing to leave
the dress-up corner

778
00:39:18,986 --> 00:39:20,781
when it's time to move on
to something else.

779
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:23,676
He'll act out the, uh

780
00:39:24,396 --> 00:39:27,261
what do you call it,
the, the "Stroke Of Midnight"

781
00:39:27,295 --> 00:39:28,296
over and over again.

782
00:39:28,317 --> 00:39:30,575
- Right. Right.
- "Bong, bong, bong."

783
00:39:30,609 --> 00:39:32,404
Yeah, "Wait, come back.

784
00:39:32,439 --> 00:39:33,819
I don't even know your name."

785
00:39:33,854 --> 00:39:35,925
- Ha-ha.
- Exactly.

786
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:38,272
Alex says he's been fine
at home.

787
00:39:40,964 --> 00:39:42,690
No, no, no, he's just, it's..

788
00:39:42,725 --> 00:39:44,485
He's been a handful lately.

789
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,798
It's, it's normal stuff.

790
00:39:51,975 --> 00:39:53,598
Alex thinks..

791
00:39:55,462 --> 00:39:58,168
...that maybe
we need to set, uh..

792
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,277
...better boundaries.

793
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,952
So that Jake can learn
a little more self-control.

794
00:40:03,815 --> 00:40:05,199
Do you agree?

795
00:40:05,554 --> 00:40:08,129
It's just that I also know
that she's not..

796
00:40:08,992 --> 00:40:11,650
She's not totally herself
right now.

797
00:40:11,685 --> 00:40:13,065
And I don't blame her, you know

798
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:16,966
she's scheduling everything,
the interviews, the tours.

799
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,624
For a while there, she was
nauseous every other morning.

800
00:40:19,658 --> 00:40:21,108
She's been sick?

801
00:40:23,386 --> 00:40:24,559
Oh, shit.

802
00:40:24,603 --> 00:40:26,743
[chuckling]

803
00:40:26,941 --> 00:40:28,909
- Please don't tell anyone.
- I won't, I won't.

804
00:40:28,943 --> 00:40:31,083
Uh, we're not telling anyone
till we're past 13 weeks.

805
00:40:31,118 --> 00:40:33,766
You know, she told people sooner
last time, and then when we lost --

806
00:40:33,776 --> 00:40:35,743
I know how hard she took it.

807
00:40:38,051 --> 00:40:41,503
I just know how much she
respects you. She always has.

808
00:40:41,749 --> 00:40:44,585
And I was thinking,
if you do talk to her

809
00:40:45,124 --> 00:40:48,100
that maybe... you could try

810
00:40:48,135 --> 00:40:49,895
to reassure her
that nothing's wrong.

811
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:52,864
Just that things
are gonna be okay.

812
00:40:55,429 --> 00:40:58,881
I'd like to show you something.
If you have a minute?

813
00:41:00,886 --> 00:41:04,130
He did these last Thursday.

814
00:41:05,877 --> 00:41:09,674
I was going to show Alex,
but as long as you're here..

815
00:41:12,711 --> 00:41:14,402
Jake did these?

816
00:41:14,437 --> 00:41:15,507
Mm-hmm.

817
00:41:18,286 --> 00:41:21,047
They don't,
they don't look like his.

818
00:41:25,157 --> 00:41:27,367
I mean, I -- I get it.
That's..

819
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:30,434
That's a lot of blood.

820
00:41:30,673 --> 00:41:33,268
Well, the blood's one thing.

821
00:41:33,836 --> 00:41:36,518
A lot of children
are fascinated by it.

822
00:41:36,792 --> 00:41:38,138
And justifiably so.

823
00:41:39,393 --> 00:41:42,396
But sometimes artwork like this

824
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:43,777
can be an opportunity.

825
00:41:43,811 --> 00:41:46,814
It can help us understand
something a child

826
00:41:46,849 --> 00:41:49,783
might be having difficulty
communicating.

827
00:41:55,789 --> 00:41:57,204
[sighs]

828
00:41:57,238 --> 00:41:59,940
Do you ever see children,
in your practice?

829
00:42:00,148 --> 00:42:04,463
No. Couples occasionally,
but mostly individuals. Why?

830
00:42:05,799 --> 00:42:07,317
I guess it's beside the point.

831
00:42:07,352 --> 00:42:08,752
I was, uh..

832
00:42:09,331 --> 00:42:12,748
...just curious if Jake has

833
00:42:12,978 --> 00:42:15,268
you know, ever expressed concern

834
00:42:15,279 --> 00:42:17,557
to either of you
about his gender.

835
00:42:18,525 --> 00:42:19,595
No.

836
00:42:21,743 --> 00:42:23,676
I mean, I don't think so.

837
00:42:25,784 --> 00:42:28,197
I mean, there's a curiosity,
maybe.

838
00:42:28,442 --> 00:42:31,134
Um, he asked once,
we were having dinner

839
00:42:31,169 --> 00:42:35,260
and he asked why boys
can't wear skirts.

840
00:42:35,932 --> 00:42:38,210
You know, 'cause girls
can wear pants.

841
00:42:39,338 --> 00:42:40,477
What'd you tell him?

842
00:42:40,597 --> 00:42:43,151
We told him the truth,
I guess, which is..

843
00:42:43,162 --> 00:42:46,096
...there is no good reason,
really.

844
00:42:46,287 --> 00:42:48,151
But then,
I -- I mentioned that, um

845
00:42:48,186 --> 00:42:50,637
in Scotland men wear kilts

846
00:42:50,671 --> 00:42:53,396
which are kind of like skirts.

847
00:42:53,407 --> 00:42:56,410
We Google-imaged kilts,
looked at some pictures.

848
00:42:56,712 --> 00:42:59,542
[chuckles]
He wasn't very impressed.

849
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:03,132
So you didn't tell him

850
00:43:03,166 --> 00:43:05,375
there are men
who do wear dresses

851
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:06,687
in our culture?

852
00:43:17,871 --> 00:43:20,321
You talk to Judy at all?
Recently?

853
00:43:21,288 --> 00:43:23,808
Week before last maybe.
Why?

854
00:43:27,052 --> 00:43:29,641
I was just wondering if we might

855
00:43:29,676 --> 00:43:32,368
wanna bring Jake to see someone.

856
00:43:32,402 --> 00:43:34,197
- A professional.
- Why?

857
00:43:34,232 --> 00:43:38,305
It's a lot of change,
all at once. You know?

858
00:43:38,339 --> 00:43:41,273
- He's visited a bunch of schools.
- Right.

859
00:43:41,308 --> 00:43:43,369
I mean, and if he's already
having trouble regulating

860
00:43:43,379 --> 00:43:46,071
his, you know, I mean..

861
00:43:46,953 --> 00:43:48,886
[sighs]

862
00:43:48,897 --> 00:43:50,761
Maybe it could be helpful.

863
00:43:50,772 --> 00:43:52,523
You don't think that might
make things worse?

864
00:43:52,705 --> 00:43:53,809
How?

865
00:43:55,322 --> 00:43:58,152
I don't know. He's only four.

866
00:43:59,852 --> 00:44:02,639
We put him in therapy,
and then there's a..

867
00:44:02,985 --> 00:44:05,712
Suddenly, there's a stranger
asking all these questions --

868
00:44:05,746 --> 00:44:08,305
You know that's not
how it works.

869
00:44:09,094 --> 00:44:11,121
But what if he starts thinking
there's something wrong with him?

870
00:44:11,131 --> 00:44:13,064
That's not what I'm saying.

871
00:44:13,098 --> 00:44:15,929
No, I know it's not.
But, you know, it's..

872
00:44:17,724 --> 00:44:20,209
I don't know, it's,
it's the message he might get.

873
00:44:28,044 --> 00:44:30,668
Kids are moody.
He'll be fine.

874
00:44:34,982 --> 00:44:37,951
[indistinct chatter]

875
00:44:37,985 --> 00:44:40,091
Okay, I think it's time
that we clean all this up

876
00:44:40,125 --> 00:44:42,576
and get ready to go home.

877
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:45,303
Jake, I'd like you to come out
and help us, please.

878
00:44:45,337 --> 00:44:46,304
No.

879
00:44:46,338 --> 00:44:47,754
I really, really, really

880
00:44:47,788 --> 00:44:48,962
need your help to clean up

881
00:44:48,996 --> 00:44:51,447
because we're getting ready
to go home.

882
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:54,450
Jake, I'd like you to come out
and help us clean this up.

883
00:44:54,484 --> 00:44:55,796
Please?

884
00:44:55,831 --> 00:44:58,765
[mellow music]

885
00:45:01,214 --> 00:45:02,802
You need help in there?

886
00:45:12,606 --> 00:45:15,146
Sandra.
Hi, it's -- it's Greg Wheeler.

887
00:45:15,643 --> 00:45:17,645
I -- I thought we were scheduled
for 2 p.m. today.

888
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:21,794
Um, maybe you're on your way,
or maybe something came up.

889
00:45:22,054 --> 00:45:26,747
Anyway, uh, call me back so we can
reschedule, if -- if we need to.

890
00:45:41,462 --> 00:45:42,429
Here you go, bud.

891
00:45:42,463 --> 00:45:43,499
[grunts]

892
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:44,973
- Working on your states again?
- Yeah.

893
00:45:44,983 --> 00:45:45,950
[doorbell buzzing]

894
00:45:46,124 --> 00:45:48,057
Oh, I bet that's your grandma.

895
00:45:50,167 --> 00:45:52,393
Oh, Catherine!
You are a lifesaver!

896
00:45:52,404 --> 00:45:54,579
I'm so sorry.
We had a sitter lined up.

897
00:45:54,613 --> 00:45:55,614
She's very reliable.

898
00:45:55,649 --> 00:45:56,882
I have no idea
what happened this time.

899
00:45:56,892 --> 00:45:58,894
Well, I don't know why
you would pay anyone.

900
00:45:58,928 --> 00:46:00,723
I've told Alex a thousand times

901
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:01,887
I'm happy to have my time
with him.

902
00:46:01,897 --> 00:46:03,208
That's very sweet.

903
00:46:03,243 --> 00:46:04,923
We just.. We know that
you're busy and we..

904
00:46:04,934 --> 00:46:06,384
- We wanted to --
- Hi, honey.

905
00:46:06,418 --> 00:46:08,973
Oh, I ran into Simon Weingold.

906
00:46:09,007 --> 00:46:10,491
He was asking after you.

907
00:46:10,526 --> 00:46:11,724
Said they're missing you
terribly.

908
00:46:11,734 --> 00:46:12,804
Aww, that's nice of him.

909
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:14,244
And I said with Jake in school
next year

910
00:46:14,254 --> 00:46:16,739
you're gonna have a lot
more time on your hands.

911
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,016
Uh, Jake?

912
00:46:18,051 --> 00:46:20,398
- Come say hi to nana!
- I still need Montana.

913
00:46:20,432 --> 00:46:21,744
Honey, no time to
curl your hair?

914
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,919
How often do you go out,
for goodness sakes?

915
00:46:23,953 --> 00:46:26,677
Well, wear it behind
if you can't.. Yeah.

916
00:46:27,163 --> 00:46:28,613
Oh, what have we got here?

917
00:46:28,647 --> 00:46:31,374
Uh, that's from the dress-up
corner at Jake's school.

918
00:46:31,409 --> 00:46:33,159
- Let me see it.
- His teacher let him take it.

919
00:46:33,169 --> 00:46:36,932
Oh. Oh, no need to explain,
I do read "The New York Times."

920
00:46:36,966 --> 00:46:38,830
God forbid anything
should be off-limits.

921
00:46:38,865 --> 00:46:39,831
So, um --

922
00:46:39,866 --> 00:46:41,660
Where is my favorite grandson?

923
00:46:41,695 --> 00:46:43,076
His dinner's ready
in the fridge.

924
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:44,239
Just zap it in the microwave,
two, three minutes.

925
00:46:44,249 --> 00:46:45,216
Set the timer
and it goes automatically.

926
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:46,320
Remember, keep it behind.

927
00:46:46,355 --> 00:46:47,518
Yeah, I have used
a microwave before.

928
00:46:47,528 --> 00:46:48,796
Oh, and the super's
right downstairs.

929
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:50,704
If you -- you need anything,
just knock.

930
00:46:50,738 --> 00:46:52,144
He stays there,
he's almost always home.

931
00:46:52,154 --> 00:46:53,603
[laughing]

932
00:46:53,638 --> 00:46:56,089
I did raise two of my own,
you remember that, don't you?

933
00:46:56,123 --> 00:46:57,607
- Very true.
- Thank you.

934
00:46:57,642 --> 00:46:59,220
Okay. Put a brush through
your hair, honey, really.

935
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:00,808
- Thank you again. Love you.
- All right.

936
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,750
- Thank you.
- Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

937
00:47:04,028 --> 00:47:06,295
Here I come! Ready or not!

938
00:47:06,604 --> 00:47:08,815
Yeah, marketing's gotta be
fascinating in that way.

939
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:11,069
Just the whole "Trying to get
inside peoples' heads."

940
00:47:11,104 --> 00:47:13,002
It must be such
a creative challenge.

941
00:47:13,037 --> 00:47:15,177
You know, it is not about
being creative.

942
00:47:15,211 --> 00:47:16,557
That's what people don't get.

943
00:47:16,592 --> 00:47:18,239
- Well, I think you're creative.
- Thank you.

944
00:47:18,249 --> 00:47:19,733
But you gotta understand

945
00:47:19,767 --> 00:47:22,529
people are up against
so many goddamn options.

946
00:47:22,563 --> 00:47:25,532
- You want some more?
- For everything. Right?

947
00:47:25,566 --> 00:47:28,052
I mean, you walk into a market,
you see like

948
00:47:28,086 --> 00:47:29,975
twenty different kinds of water,
for Christ sake.

949
00:47:29,985 --> 00:47:31,400
I mean..

950
00:47:31,434 --> 00:47:33,150
So the best marketing strategy
is not about being creative.

951
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,255
- I'm not gonna..
- No, no, no, no.

952
00:47:34,265 --> 00:47:35,335
It's about being direct.

953
00:47:35,369 --> 00:47:37,130
It's about being simple.

954
00:47:37,164 --> 00:47:38,994
And ultimately, people..

955
00:47:39,028 --> 00:47:41,272
And, look, I'll just say this.

956
00:47:41,306 --> 00:47:42,576
I'm sorry.

957
00:47:43,136 --> 00:47:44,576
Especially women..

958
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:46,933
...they wanna be told
what to do.

959
00:47:47,685 --> 00:47:48,720
[laughs]

960
00:47:48,818 --> 00:47:50,474
No, we don't.

961
00:47:50,626 --> 00:47:52,421
I call complete bullshit
on that.

962
00:47:52,455 --> 00:47:54,216
- It's not bullshit.
- So much bullshit.

963
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:55,803
Can I get anyone another round?

964
00:47:55,838 --> 00:47:57,253
Yeah, I'd love another drink.

965
00:47:57,288 --> 00:47:58,254
Uh..

966
00:47:58,289 --> 00:47:59,428
I'm sorry.

967
00:47:59,462 --> 00:48:00,971
What is your favorite
specialty cocktail?

968
00:48:00,981 --> 00:48:02,051
Ah! Case in point.

969
00:48:02,086 --> 00:48:03,180
No, that's not what I'm doing.

970
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:04,433
I'm asking her opinion.

971
00:48:04,467 --> 00:48:05,987
I really like
the elderflower saketini.

972
00:48:06,021 --> 00:48:08,644
- I can't hear you.
- Um, yeah, sure. I'll have one of those.

973
00:48:08,678 --> 00:48:10,680
- Thank you.
- What's going on?

974
00:48:10,715 --> 00:48:12,648
I -- I'm so sorry.

975
00:48:13,097 --> 00:48:14,477
He what?

976
00:48:16,134 --> 00:48:18,067
- I'll be back.
- Yeah. Okay.

977
00:48:19,482 --> 00:48:22,037
Calm down.
No, no, no, I understand.

978
00:48:22,071 --> 00:48:23,417
What happened?

979
00:48:23,452 --> 00:48:25,523
- He threw Cinderella at her.
- What?

980
00:48:25,557 --> 00:48:26,731
The figurine.

981
00:48:26,765 --> 00:48:27,801
[chuckles]

982
00:48:27,835 --> 00:48:29,147
[exhales]

983
00:48:29,182 --> 00:48:32,495
Look.. Look, just -- just
put him on the phone, okay?

984
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:34,050
I wanna talk to him.

985
00:48:35,015 --> 00:48:36,948
Yeah, well, tell him
if he doesn't stop now

986
00:48:36,983 --> 00:48:38,215
we're canceling his
birthday party.

987
00:48:38,225 --> 00:48:39,354
- I'm -- I'm serious.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.

988
00:48:39,364 --> 00:48:40,331
Wait. Wait a minute.
Let me talk to her.

989
00:48:40,365 --> 00:48:41,332
Let me talk to her.
Come here.

990
00:48:41,366 --> 00:48:43,023
Hey.
Hi, Cate. It's Greg.

991
00:48:43,058 --> 00:48:45,094
I'm so sorry.
Do you need us to come home?

992
00:48:45,129 --> 00:48:47,683
- That's exactly what he wants!
- What's that?

993
00:48:47,717 --> 00:48:49,271
No, I know.

994
00:48:50,515 --> 00:48:52,897
No, we'll leave the phone on
so you co..

995
00:48:54,851 --> 00:48:57,750
Right. Okay, well.. Bye.

996
00:48:58,004 --> 00:49:00,144
I mean, he's not an idiot.
He knows what he's doing.

997
00:49:00,178 --> 00:49:02,298
Well, yeah. I mean, honestly,
if you're upset about it

998
00:49:02,318 --> 00:49:03,620
you might consider
listening to me

999
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:04,932
and maybe we should bring him
to see someone.

1000
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,278
Okay.
Can we not do this right now?

1001
00:49:06,288 --> 00:49:07,772
He just assaulted
his grandmother.

1002
00:49:07,806 --> 00:49:09,291
Well, she's probably
exaggerating.

1003
00:49:09,325 --> 00:49:11,431
Oh, and you threaten to cancel
his birthday party

1004
00:49:11,465 --> 00:49:12,865
because she's probably
exaggerating?

1005
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,538
Greg, I was setting a boundary.
That's allowed.

1006
00:49:15,573 --> 00:49:17,599
Yeah, it is, but don't flip it
around and try to minimize it.

1007
00:49:17,609 --> 00:49:18,980
If he's acting out,
he's acting out.

1008
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:20,992
Greg, he's a kid.

1009
00:49:21,027 --> 00:49:23,546
God forbid, he should be a
little more aggressive than you.

1010
00:49:29,449 --> 00:49:32,003
- I'm so sorry, guys.
- Oh, of course.

1011
00:49:32,038 --> 00:49:34,454
- Is everything okay?
- Oh, y -- you know.

1012
00:49:34,488 --> 00:49:36,525
He's just punishing us
for having a night out.

1013
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:38,285
You know, maybe I should go.

1014
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,873
- Greg, we offered.
- I know.

1015
00:49:39,907 --> 00:49:41,451
But I just think that
if one of us was there --

1016
00:49:41,461 --> 00:49:43,911
We can't just upend our plans
every time he's in a mood.

1017
00:49:43,946 --> 00:49:46,535
- Where's the lesson in that?
- Fine. You're the boss.

1018
00:49:46,569 --> 00:49:48,433
Here you are, miss.
The elderflower saketini.

1019
00:49:48,468 --> 00:49:49,607
Thank you.
Perfect timing.

1020
00:49:49,641 --> 00:49:51,195
- Cheers to grown-up time.
- Cheers.

1021
00:49:51,229 --> 00:49:52,541
[laughing]

1022
00:49:53,645 --> 00:49:54,612
[Darren clears throat]

1023
00:49:54,646 --> 00:49:57,028
So, Caitlyn Jenner.

1024
00:49:57,063 --> 00:50:00,066
- Is she a lesbian now or what?
- What?

1025
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,344
Well, okay, so I was listening
to this interview

1026
00:50:02,378 --> 00:50:08,315
where, um, he, she, uh, yeah,
Ms. Jenner, uh, she said that

1027
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:10,628
she was still attracted
to women.

1028
00:50:10,662 --> 00:50:13,458
And, you know,
even though now she's a..

1029
00:50:13,493 --> 00:50:16,599
So I was just wondering,
is she.. What is she now?

1030
00:50:16,634 --> 00:50:17,659
- Is she a lesbian or what?
- I'm sorry.

1031
00:50:17,669 --> 00:50:19,188
- How did we get onto..
- I know.

1032
00:50:19,223 --> 00:50:21,121
It was just.. I have no idea.

1033
00:50:21,156 --> 00:50:23,089
It just, you know,
he watches so much TV.

1034
00:50:23,123 --> 00:50:26,264
I was just reminded of it
because when you were outside

1035
00:50:26,299 --> 00:50:28,856
we were talking
about your son, and..

1036
00:50:29,738 --> 00:50:33,811
I, I was just explaining that..

1037
00:50:34,874 --> 00:50:37,083
I was just saying it's hard,
you know?

1038
00:50:37,344 --> 00:50:39,381
Admissions time, kindergarten.

1039
00:50:39,415 --> 00:50:42,729
It's so hard for,
for a child, you know, who..

1040
00:50:42,763 --> 00:50:45,111
- Who, who what?
- Who just..

1041
00:50:45,145 --> 00:50:47,044
Who has a unique expression.
Alex --

1042
00:50:47,078 --> 00:50:49,563
Listen, hey, you know,
my brother, Mikey

1043
00:50:49,598 --> 00:50:54,120
when he was a kid,
he was obsessed with that

1044
00:50:54,154 --> 00:50:56,994
uh, that, that game
Pretty Pretty Princess.

1045
00:50:57,067 --> 00:51:00,770
And, you know, you cut to, uh,
freshman year of college

1046
00:51:00,781 --> 00:51:02,300
and he's on the football team.

1047
00:51:02,335 --> 00:51:03,991
Two hundred pounds,
six-foot-three.

1048
00:51:04,026 --> 00:51:05,303
So it just goes to show --

1049
00:51:05,338 --> 00:51:06,580
I'm not sure I follow.

1050
00:51:06,615 --> 00:51:08,479
I'm just saying that you,
you may..

1051
00:51:08,513 --> 00:51:11,102
You, you probably don't need,
need to worry.

1052
00:51:11,137 --> 00:51:12,690
- That's all.
- No one's worried.

1053
00:51:12,724 --> 00:51:13,794
That's not what he meant.

1054
00:51:13,829 --> 00:51:14,889
Well, that's not exactly true.

1055
00:51:14,899 --> 00:51:16,003
I'm a little worried.

1056
00:51:16,038 --> 00:51:17,522
And so are his teachers --

1057
00:51:17,557 --> 00:51:18,868
All right, you know what?

1058
00:51:18,903 --> 00:51:20,180
Amal, let me ask you something.

1059
00:51:20,215 --> 00:51:22,941
You took Sanjay to see
a therapist last year, right?

1060
00:51:22,976 --> 00:51:24,874
- Greg.
- I'm sorry.

1061
00:51:24,909 --> 00:51:27,808
Is that a taboo subject?
I just.. We're all friends here.

1062
00:51:27,843 --> 00:51:29,283
I think you've had
a little too much to drink.

1063
00:51:29,293 --> 00:51:33,319
I just am curious about
your experience as a parent.

1064
00:51:33,533 --> 00:51:35,218
And it's fine.

1065
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:37,128
Well, with the divorce

1066
00:51:37,163 --> 00:51:38,612
we wanted to be safe.

1067
00:51:38,647 --> 00:51:40,511
- So I took him to a therapist.
- Thank you.

1068
00:51:40,545 --> 00:51:43,134
Okay. Well, that was
a very different situation.

1069
00:51:43,169 --> 00:51:44,004
How is that different?

1070
00:51:44,015 --> 00:51:46,093
Because with Sanjay there
was an obvious problem.

1071
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:48,760
- What do you mean by that?
- No, not, not problem. I..

1072
00:51:48,795 --> 00:51:51,246
- Right.
- No, no, no. I just meant..

1073
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,144
You know,
there was something external.

1074
00:51:53,179 --> 00:51:54,653
- Not just how he likes to play.
- I think we should just..

1075
00:51:54,663 --> 00:51:56,172
I really think we should just
drop this right now.

1076
00:51:56,182 --> 00:51:57,345
It's more than
how he likes to play.

1077
00:51:57,355 --> 00:51:58,450
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means --

1078
00:51:58,460 --> 00:51:59,944
What?
What were you gonna say?

1079
00:51:59,978 --> 00:52:02,536
- We can talk about it later.
- No. What?

1080
00:52:03,085 --> 00:52:04,283
Let's have it.
What were you gonna say?

1081
00:52:04,294 --> 00:52:05,903
We're all friends, right?

1082
00:52:06,784 --> 00:52:07,661
Fine.

1083
00:52:07,672 --> 00:52:10,530
Uh, I was giving Jake a bath
the other night

1084
00:52:10,541 --> 00:52:14,027
and he tucked his penis
between his legs, okay?

1085
00:52:14,061 --> 00:52:15,832
All boys do that.

1086
00:52:16,108 --> 00:52:17,316
Right?

1087
00:52:17,444 --> 00:52:18,894
- Well, not really.
- Sure.

1088
00:52:18,928 --> 00:52:20,792
Oh, come on.
You're saying Sanjay's never..

1089
00:52:20,827 --> 00:52:21,931
- No.
- Okay.

1090
00:52:21,966 --> 00:52:23,450
You're saying
he's done this before?

1091
00:52:23,485 --> 00:52:24,451
[chuckles]

1092
00:52:24,486 --> 00:52:25,625
Well, it's bath time.

1093
00:52:25,659 --> 00:52:27,627
What am I supposed to say, "No?"

1094
00:52:27,661 --> 00:52:29,481
Clearly, you're the one
who had a problem with it.

1095
00:52:29,491 --> 00:52:30,975
I didn't say
I had a problem with it.

1096
00:52:31,009 --> 00:52:33,115
I said that there are people
who specialize

1097
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,772
in exactly this type
of behavior.

1098
00:52:34,806 --> 00:52:36,843
Frankly, I'm not sure what
Jake needs right now

1099
00:52:36,877 --> 00:52:39,156
is one more adult in his life
gossiping behind his back.

1100
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:40,502
Oh, my --

1101
00:52:40,536 --> 00:52:41,503
Trying to come up
with some sort of diagnosis.

1102
00:52:41,537 --> 00:52:43,298
No one was gossiping, Alex!

1103
00:52:43,332 --> 00:52:45,714
You need to really stop it.
It's just..

1104
00:52:45,748 --> 00:52:48,199
Hey, can I interest anyone
in some dessert?

1105
00:52:48,234 --> 00:52:49,235
We're good.

1106
00:52:49,269 --> 00:52:51,513
Just, just the check.

1107
00:53:32,519 --> 00:53:35,971
Okay. You can just take
a seat back there.

1108
00:53:39,159 --> 00:53:43,232
- How much have I gained?
- Three pounds since last time.

1109
00:53:43,243 --> 00:53:48,110
So a total of almost five.

1110
00:53:48,129 --> 00:53:49,716
I feel like with my son
it was more.

1111
00:53:49,916 --> 00:53:51,124
Yeah, it varies.

1112
00:53:51,158 --> 00:53:54,092
But it's definitely within
the normal range.

Hey! Hi, Kimmie.

Good Lord!
That is almost as big as Jake!

00:55:09,167 --> 00:55:10,366
Yeah.
Well, I kept the receipt.

- Nice to see you. How are you?

Oh, my goodness gracious.

Don't you look nice.

- Who was, uh..
- Hi, Kimmie.

- Everybody, it's for Jake.
- Let me see it.

1142

It's his present, his birthday.

You know,
I wish you wouldn't do that.

What?

1149
00:56:08,157 --> 00:56:12,265

a waste of time.

with you, baby?

What happened?

Sanjay pushed Bobby.

1157
00:56:32,561 --> 00:56:35,978
He started it, because
Bobby called Jake a flag.

1158
00:56:36,013 --> 00:56:37,601
- Oh.
- Oh.

1159

but this is --

I'm not with a client.

00:59:08,855 --> 00:59:10,029
Right on time.

1187
00:59:10,063 --> 00:59:12,031
Got some good news for us?

1188
00:59:13,066 --> 00:59:14,447
Come on in.

[sighs]

1190
00:59:19,348 --> 00:59:22,041
Okay, but this is
preliminary feedback, right?

1191
00:59:22,075 --> 00:59:23,308
They haven't made
their decisions.

1192
00:59:23,318 --> 00:59:24,664
That's true.

1193
00:59:24,699 --> 00:59:28,461
So is there any chance one could
still end up accepting him?

1194
00:59:28,495 --> 00:59:31,568
It's possible,
but I have to be honest.

1195
00:59:31,602 --> 00:59:35,442
At this point, it's unlikely it
would come with financial aid.

1196
00:59:35,567 --> 00:59:39,156
What about, uh, the magnets?
Uh, BSI? PS 20?

1197
00:59:39,167 --> 00:59:40,927
We'll know more in a few weeks.

1198
00:59:41,151 --> 00:59:43,049
But his scores were so high.

1199
00:59:43,131 --> 00:59:44,719
They're very strong

1200
00:59:44,753 --> 00:59:46,203
but the cut-offs go up
every year.

1201
00:59:46,237 --> 00:59:48,343
There's just too much demand.

1202
00:59:49,429 --> 00:59:52,830
So, you're saying he could be
shut out everywhere?

1203
00:59:53,706 --> 00:59:56,640
I'm saying
we need to be prepared.

1204
00:59:59,776 --> 01:00:01,743
You know what?
This is a numbers game.

1205
01:00:01,941 --> 01:00:02,907
We knew this.

1206
01:00:03,028 --> 01:00:04,270
We went to public school.

1207
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:06,533
- We turned out okay, right?
- Mm-hmm.

1208
01:00:06,568 --> 01:00:08,639
Remember, he could also do
another year with us.

1209
01:00:08,674 --> 01:00:10,296
Reapply next fall.

1210
01:00:10,330 --> 01:00:14,024
I know it's not ideal,
but under the circumstances

1211
01:00:14,058 --> 01:00:17,234
I think it might be
the best thing for him.

1212
01:00:17,268 --> 01:00:19,408
- What do you mean?
- She's just --

1213
01:00:19,443 --> 01:00:20,986
I mean, if the gifted
programs don't work --

1214
01:00:20,996 --> 01:00:23,999
No, but, but what circumstances?

1215
01:00:24,010 --> 01:00:27,865
Look, there is no question
he's bright.

1216
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:31,144
He's creative. That comes across
in all of the feedback.

1217
01:00:31,179 --> 01:00:35,252
But several places also note
that he gets stubborn

1218
01:00:35,286 --> 01:00:37,288
and defensive
when dealing with other kids.

1219
01:00:37,323 --> 01:00:41,085
Frankly, you two are very lucky
to be raising a kid like Jake

1220
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:44,192
now instead of 50 years ago,
even 20 years ago.

1221
01:00:44,226 --> 01:00:46,884
What exactly does that mean?
"A kid like Jake?"

1222
01:00:46,919 --> 01:00:48,220
Okay, you know, I think
we're getting off topic --

1223
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:51,026
Alex, I'm very sorry
that this isn't the news

1224
01:00:51,061 --> 01:00:53,270
we were hoping for,
but you have to understand

1225
01:00:53,304 --> 01:00:54,961
the number of spots
we're talking about --

1226
01:00:54,996 --> 01:00:56,307
Of course, and -- and -- and

1227
01:00:56,342 --> 01:00:58,102
I know how many kids
you have to place.

1228
01:00:58,137 --> 01:01:01,519
Whoa. I'm not sure
what you're implying here

1229
01:01:01,554 --> 01:01:04,074
but you know that
I care very deeply about Jake.

1230
01:01:04,108 --> 01:01:06,352
Which is why
I'm doing everything in my power

1231
01:01:06,386 --> 01:01:08,388
to place him somewhere
where he feels safe

1232
01:01:08,423 --> 01:01:09,700
and comfortable enough to --

1233
01:01:09,735 --> 01:01:11,771
- To dress like a girl.
- Okay.

1234
01:01:11,806 --> 01:01:14,360
I mean, that -- that's obviously
what you're saying

1235
01:01:14,394 --> 01:01:17,915
and maybe the problem is that we
all started pitching him as --

1236
01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:19,355
Alex, he had no idea
what was in that essay.

1237
01:01:19,365 --> 01:01:20,607
It doesn't matter!

1238
01:01:20,642 --> 01:01:22,782
Obviously it's going
to affect the way that people --

1239
01:01:22,817 --> 01:01:25,761
I'm talking about him feeling
safe and respected.

1240
01:01:25,772 --> 01:01:28,535
Yes, but isn't there
a danger of imposing --

1241
01:01:28,546 --> 01:01:31,411
Imposing what exactly?

1242
01:01:31,446 --> 01:01:32,758
[exhales]

1243
01:01:32,792 --> 01:01:34,483
No, not, not, not imposing.

1244
01:01:34,518 --> 01:01:37,107
That -- that was, that..

1245
01:01:37,970 --> 01:01:39,143
Greg.

1246
01:01:39,178 --> 01:01:42,422
Alex, do you think
my sexual orientation

1247
01:01:42,457 --> 01:01:45,702
has anything to do with
my advice regarding your son?

1248
01:01:45,736 --> 01:01:47,220
- What?
- Judy, of course not.

1249
01:01:47,255 --> 01:01:49,775
Because every time
I try to bring up my concerns

1250
01:01:49,809 --> 01:01:52,709
you respond like I'm pushing
some political agenda.

1251
01:01:52,743 --> 01:01:54,124
And let me tell you

1252
01:01:54,158 --> 01:01:57,127
the impulse to embrace children
as they are is not an agenda.

1253
01:01:57,161 --> 01:01:58,611
No, I -- I never --

1254
01:01:58,645 --> 01:02:00,993
And like it or not, you two have
some choices to make here.

1255
01:02:01,027 --> 01:02:02,270
There's a problem.

1256
01:02:02,304 --> 01:02:04,893
If you don't believe me,
just read the feedback yourself.

1257
01:02:04,928 --> 01:02:07,378
He's acting out.
Verbally. Physically.

1258
01:02:07,413 --> 01:02:09,760
Yes, and, maybe..

1259
01:02:09,795 --> 01:02:10,934
Maybe he's sick of us

1260
01:02:10,968 --> 01:02:13,695
of us pushing him
into this, this role.

1261
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,525
Alex, you can't expect him
to never realize he's different.

1262
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:19,425
No, but I can wait
until he tells me himself --

1263
01:02:19,459 --> 01:02:21,082
But it sounds like he's trying

1264
01:02:21,116 --> 01:02:22,773
but you're just determined
to ignore it.

1265
01:02:22,808 --> 01:02:24,006
- I am not ignoring it!
- Okay.

1266
01:02:24,016 --> 01:02:25,880
- Jesus!
- Okay. Okay.

1267
01:02:25,914 --> 01:02:28,365
Maybe if you'd ever had
your own kids..

1268
01:02:33,266 --> 01:02:34,889
You know what?

1269
01:02:34,923 --> 01:02:36,856
We're done. Okay?

[machine beeping]

1272
01:03:13,686 --> 01:03:15,170
And I'll come grab him.

1273
01:03:15,205 --> 01:03:18,729
Um, I guess I'll just..
I'll text you when we're..

1274
01:03:18,847 --> 01:03:20,849
No, no, everything's fine.
He's..

1275
01:03:21,142 --> 01:03:23,006
Um, it's, it'll be fine.

1276
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:25,387
Yeah. Okay. Thank you.

1277
01:03:26,112 --> 01:03:27,251
Bye.

1280
01:04:21,098 --> 01:04:22,410
You should lie down.

[water gushing]

1282
01:05:06,972 --> 01:05:08,042

1283
01:05:16,809 --> 01:05:17,844
Come on.

[sniffles]

1285
01:05:45,527 --> 01:05:47,115
I think you should leave.

1286
01:05:52,362 --> 01:05:53,673
I'm not going anywhere.

1287
01:05:54,778 --> 01:05:56,504
We don't have to talk

1288
01:05:56,538 --> 01:05:58,851
but I'm not leaving you alone
right now.

1289
01:05:58,885 --> 01:06:01,440
I don't think I can not talk.

If you're here,
I, I don't think I can..

1292
01:06:09,034 --> 01:06:11,001
...not say something.

1293
01:06:11,036 --> 01:06:12,992
Something mean.

1294
01:06:13,003 --> 01:06:16,524
I'm very angry.

1295
01:06:18,112 --> 01:06:19,423
I understand.

1296
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:23,393
I'm angry at you, Greg.

1297
01:06:26,801 --> 01:06:28,250
You should have said something.

1298
01:06:28,536 --> 01:06:31,159
To Judy. She was out of line.

1299
01:06:31,194 --> 01:06:34,576
And -- and -- and
you just sat there.

1300
01:06:43,824 --> 01:06:45,471
We're not gonna have this
conversation right now.

1301
01:06:45,482 --> 01:06:47,691
Yes, please tell me
what conversations --

1302
01:06:47,702 --> 01:06:49,246
Alex, if you need
to be mad at me, that's fine

1303
01:06:49,257 --> 01:06:50,845
but I am not going to fight.
That's --

1304
01:06:50,869 --> 01:06:53,604
You should have said something.

1305
01:06:53,615 --> 01:06:54,927
[exhales]

1306
01:06:54,938 --> 01:06:57,518
Well, frankly,
I could barely get a word in.

1307
01:06:57,776 --> 01:06:59,951
I was trying to keep things
from escalating.

1308
01:07:00,087 --> 01:07:02,710
Right. Right.
God forbid anyone gets angry.

1309
01:07:02,777 --> 01:07:04,917
God forbid
you ever piss someone off.

1310
01:07:04,951 --> 01:07:06,919
All right, this is ridiculous.
You're in shock.

1311
01:07:06,953 --> 01:07:09,853
- And we're both grieving.
- Oh, thank you. I'd forgotten.

1312
01:07:09,887 --> 01:07:11,948
You know, trying to make me
feel as much pain as you do --

1313
01:07:11,958 --> 01:07:13,305
That is not what I'm doing.

1314
01:07:13,339 --> 01:07:15,376
Of course it is,
maybe not consciously.

1315
01:07:15,410 --> 01:07:16,712
- But that's definitely --
- Oh, my God!

1316
01:07:16,722 --> 01:07:17,792
Things I could do without.

1317
01:07:17,826 --> 01:07:20,346
Number one,
the fucking unconscious.

1318
01:07:20,381 --> 01:07:22,245
Please, please, spare me that.

1319
01:07:22,279 --> 01:07:23,763
Fine. Let's blame Freud, right?

1320
01:07:23,798 --> 01:07:25,627
It's Freud's fault
you miscarried.

1321
01:07:25,662 --> 01:07:27,146
Oh, I miscarried?

1322
01:07:27,181 --> 01:07:29,045
No, that is not what I..

1323
01:07:29,079 --> 01:07:31,840
You think if I'd just taken
better care of myself?

1324
01:07:31,875 --> 01:07:33,463
Would you please --

1325
01:07:33,497 --> 01:07:36,111
If -- if -- if -- if, if I hadn't
overburdened myself

1326
01:07:36,112 --> 01:07:36,120
 Stop. Stop. Stop.

1327
01:07:36,121 --> 01:07:37,456
with Jake's applications?

1328
01:07:37,467 --> 01:07:39,656
If -- if -- if I had let you call
an ambulance

1329
01:07:39,667 --> 01:07:39,675
Ally, for God sake.

1330
01:07:39,676 --> 01:07:40,706
Instead of taking a cab

1331
01:07:40,717 --> 01:07:42,019
maybe we would have
gotten there sooner?

1332
01:07:42,030 --> 01:07:44,198
Yeah, well,
now we'll never know, will we?

1333
01:07:53,138 --> 01:07:54,794
Ally, I'm sorry.

1334
01:07:54,829 --> 01:07:56,831
- You're an asshole.
- Jesus.

1335
01:07:56,865 --> 01:07:58,315
This is hard for me too.

1336
01:07:58,350 --> 01:07:59,789
Is that impossible for you
to understand.

1337
01:07:59,799 --> 01:08:02,906
I needed help, Greg

1338
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:04,770
and you just sat there.

1339
01:08:04,804 --> 01:08:06,530
Like, like you were embarrassed.

1340
01:08:06,565 --> 01:08:08,143
- Do you have any idea --
- Okay, I'm not gonna do this.

1341
01:08:08,153 --> 01:08:10,675
What.. Where're you going?
Greg!

1342
01:08:10,925 --> 01:08:13,399
Greg, you can't just walk away
in the middle --

1343
01:08:13,434 --> 01:08:14,883
In the middle of what?
An argument?

1344
01:08:14,918 --> 01:08:18,175
This is not an argument.
This is you shitting on me.

1345
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:20,406
So I'm gonna go pick up Jake

1346
01:08:20,441 --> 01:08:22,191
and I'm gonna take him out,
and when I get back

1347
01:08:22,201 --> 01:08:23,754
I hope that you're in bed

1348
01:08:23,789 --> 01:08:25,869
'cause frankly, he doesn't need
to see you like this.

1349
01:08:25,894 --> 01:08:28,449
Fine. Fine.

1350
01:08:28,483 --> 01:08:29,898
[scoffs]

1351
01:08:29,933 --> 01:08:32,556
Yeah, go take him out
for ice cream.

1352
01:08:32,591 --> 01:08:33,720
And when you're done,
why don't you both

1353
01:08:33,730 --> 01:08:35,525
get your nails done, huh?

1354
01:08:35,559 --> 01:08:37,354
I mean, why not?

1355
01:08:37,389 --> 01:08:39,149
It's not like you've ever
taken him to a park

1356
01:08:39,184 --> 01:08:41,772
or thrown a ball
in his direction.

1357
01:09:01,413 --> 01:09:03,829
That's a disgusting thing
to say.

1358
01:09:07,212 --> 01:09:09,815
You think it's my fault
he likes dresses?

1359
01:09:10,353 --> 01:09:13,390
No, you think
I'm too effete a role model?

1360
01:09:13,425 --> 01:09:15,348
- Who the fuck are you?
- Greg, that's, that's not --

1361
01:09:15,358 --> 01:09:17,601
Did you listen to the feedback?

1362
01:09:17,636 --> 01:09:19,293
"Stubborn? Defensive?"

1363
01:09:19,327 --> 01:09:21,640
Did that not remind you
of anyone?

1364
01:09:21,674 --> 01:09:23,010
Not to mention
you're the one reading him

1365
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:25,437
fairy tales every night,
you're the one buying him

1366
01:09:25,471 --> 01:09:28,474
every Disney princess DVD
you can get your hands on

1367
01:09:28,509 --> 01:09:31,546
and then, freaking out
when people start to notice.

1368
01:09:31,581 --> 01:09:34,417
I mean, is it any wonder
he's confused?

1369
01:09:35,412 --> 01:09:37,542
You know, maybe the reason
I didn't say anything to Judy

1370
01:09:37,552 --> 01:09:39,237
is because I agree with her.

1371
01:09:39,248 --> 01:09:41,733
And I think we need
to make some choices

1372
01:09:41,936 --> 01:09:43,731
about how to address
the situation.

1373
01:09:43,765 --> 01:09:45,595
Fine. You know, bring, bring him
to a shrink.

1374
01:09:45,629 --> 01:09:47,217
What do I know, right?

1375
01:09:47,252 --> 01:09:49,150
I'm just the one
at home with him.

1376
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:52,188
- All day, every day. What?
- Oh, for God's sake!

1377
01:09:52,222 --> 01:09:55,191
You get to have a life outside
this apartment. I gave that up.

1378
01:09:55,225 --> 01:09:56,561
Do you wanna go back
to work? Do it!

1379
01:09:56,571 --> 01:09:57,700
- No one's stopping you.
- No. No.

1380
01:09:57,710 --> 01:10:00,023
I made a choice to be here

1381
01:10:00,057 --> 01:10:02,405
because I wanted him to have
a mother who's devoted --

1382
01:10:02,439 --> 01:10:04,752
And because you hated
being a lawyer!

1383
01:10:04,786 --> 01:10:08,583
Christ! Don't pretend like you
weren't desperate to get out.

1384
01:10:08,618 --> 01:10:10,240
This is what you wanted.

1385
01:10:10,275 --> 01:10:12,311
So, I'm sorry
if motherhood turns out to be

1386
01:10:12,346 --> 01:10:14,727
just another disappointment,
but I am his father.

1387
01:10:14,762 --> 01:10:16,902
I live here too,
and I'm sick of being treated

1388
01:10:16,936 --> 01:10:19,525
like you're raising him alone.

1389
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:23,529
Jake is not a disappointment.

1390
01:10:23,564 --> 01:10:26,152

1394
01:10:37,198 --> 01:10:39,407
I'm sorry
for making you so unhappy.

1395
01:10:39,442 --> 01:10:43,066
I'm -- I'm sorry
for taking you for granted.

I'm -- I'm sorry
for all the ways

01:10:46,311 --> 01:10:48,244
I've fucked things up with Jake.

- Ally.
- I am. I am.

- I'm sorry about the baby.
- No.

For whatever I did wrong.

1401
01:10:55,354 --> 01:10:57,770
I am not asking you
to apologize.

1402

Just please, please,
let's just stop.

She called before
at the hospital.

1407

everything was okay.

is holding you back?

I mean, like I said it's stupid.
It's just a signature.

It's not like
it changes anything.
