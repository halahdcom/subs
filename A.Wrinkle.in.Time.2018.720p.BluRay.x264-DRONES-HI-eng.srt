Well, Dad always told me

163
00:10:02,357 --> 00:10:04,059
to stand up
for what I believe in.

164
00:10:12,165 --> 00:10:14,268
Don't use Dad like that.

165
00:10:15,169 --> 00:10:16,905
It's not fair.

166
00:10:23,312 --> 00:10:26,082
He's not coming back,
is he?

(SIGHS)

168
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:37,221
Don't give up hope, Meglet.

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,162
CHARLES WALLACE: I knew
it was you! Come on in.

171
00:10:43,164 --> 00:10:46,666
WOMAN: Wow! Talk about
a dark and stormy night.

172
00:10:46,668 --> 00:10:49,568
Are those
Mrs. Buncombe's sheets?

173
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:50,772
WOMAN: (CHUCKLES) Maybe.

174
00:10:56,578 --> 00:10:57,744
Excuse me.

175
00:10:57,746 --> 00:11:00,446
Oh, aren't you dazzling!
You must be Dr. Murry.

176
00:11:00,448 --> 00:11:01,880
MRS. MURRY: Yes. And...

177
00:11:01,882 --> 00:11:03,750
WOMAN: Your house is so warm.

178
00:11:03,752 --> 00:11:05,921
You've done a wonderful job
keeping the darkness out.

179
00:11:07,254 --> 00:11:09,055
(QUIETLY) Mom. Mom!

180
00:11:09,057 --> 00:11:11,356
- Do you want me to call 911?
- (BELL JINGLES)

00:11:11,358 --> 00:11:13,326
Well, almost all the darkness.

00:11:13,328 --> 00:11:15,562
You must be Meg.

183
00:11:15,564 --> 00:11:17,430
How... How do you
know my name?

184
00:11:17,432 --> 00:11:18,599
CHARLES WALLACE:
Because I told her.

185
00:11:18,601 --> 00:11:20,566
Guys, calm down.

186
00:11:20,568 --> 00:11:22,939
Don't worry.
She's my friend.

187
00:11:23,805 --> 00:11:25,740
Call me Mrs. Whatsit.

188
00:11:26,641 --> 00:11:28,172
Mrs. Who?

189
00:11:28,174 --> 00:11:29,610
No, Mrs. Whatsit.

190
00:11:29,612 --> 00:11:31,110
Mrs. Who is...

191
00:11:31,112 --> 00:11:32,579
She's, like,
a billion years older

192
00:11:32,581 --> 00:11:34,547
and way more
knowledgeable.

193
00:11:34,549 --> 00:11:38,552
What can I do for you,
Mrs. Whatsit?

194
00:11:38,554 --> 00:11:40,152
CHARLES WALLACE:
I caught her stealing sheets.

195
00:11:40,154 --> 00:11:42,187
Guys, she's harmless.

196
00:11:42,189 --> 00:11:44,557
You're six. Come on.

197
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:45,959
What do you know
about harmless?

198
00:11:45,961 --> 00:11:47,793
CHARLES WALLACE:
Have I ever been wrong?

199
00:11:47,795 --> 00:11:50,096
One of these days, you
might be, Charles Wallace.

200
00:11:50,098 --> 00:11:51,296
MRS. WHATSIT:
Oh, I highly doubt that.

201
00:11:51,298 --> 00:11:53,736
He's one of the greatest minds
in recent history.

202
00:11:54,302 --> 00:11:55,935
He's prodigious.

203
00:11:55,937 --> 00:11:59,572
But of course, we can't take
any credit for our talents.

204
00:11:59,574 --> 00:12:02,078
It's how we use them
that counts.

205
00:12:04,545 --> 00:12:06,946
MRS. MURRY: Okay, then.
The thing is...

206
00:12:06,948 --> 00:12:10,649
we don't know you,
and it's late, so...

207
00:12:10,651 --> 00:12:14,020
Oh, is it?
I'm terrible with time.

208
00:12:14,022 --> 00:12:16,223
Mrs. Which
usually handles that.

209
00:12:16,757 --> 00:12:18,490
MRS. MURRY: Uh... Right.

210
00:12:18,492 --> 00:12:19,759
Um...

211
00:12:19,761 --> 00:12:21,527
The thing is, uh...

212
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:24,630
the kids need
to get to bed...

213
00:12:24,632 --> 00:12:27,335
so if you don't mind
visiting some other time.

214
00:12:28,703 --> 00:12:30,905
Oh, of course I will.

215
00:12:31,906 --> 00:12:34,910
I just wanna tell you
one thing before I go.

216
00:12:42,183 --> 00:12:46,119
I want you to know
that no matter what happens...

217
00:12:46,121 --> 00:12:50,025
you and your husband achieved
something truly extraordinary.

218
00:12:51,259 --> 00:12:53,427
What are you
talking about?

219
00:12:53,429 --> 00:12:54,927
Just that there really is

220
00:12:54,929 --> 00:12:57,933
such a thing
as a tesseract.

221
00:12:59,001 --> 00:13:00,068
What?

222
00:13:04,472 --> 00:13:06,572
A tesseract?

223
00:13:06,574 --> 00:13:08,774
That's what I said.
Tesseract.

224
00:13:08,776 --> 00:13:11,512
MEG: Is... Is this
some kind of joke?

225
00:13:11,514 --> 00:13:13,745
Did Veronica
put you up to this?

226
00:13:13,747 --> 00:13:16,450
(SIGHS) You really don't
trust easily, do you?

227
00:13:16,452 --> 00:13:18,018
Hmm.

228
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,385
Charles Wallace,
I'm not sure about Meg.

229
00:13:20,387 --> 00:13:21,990
Give her a chance.

230
00:13:22,491 --> 00:13:23,789
Okay.

231
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,725
You're the boss.

232
00:13:25,727 --> 00:13:27,463
I better run.

233
00:13:29,631 --> 00:13:33,334
Ah! Wild nights are my glory.

234
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,555
MEG: Never do that again.

235
00:13:54,557 --> 00:13:57,957
Never let anyone in the house
without our permission.

236
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:02,095
And please stop talking
to strangers.

237
00:14:02,097 --> 00:14:04,195
CHARLES WALLACE: I don't
talk to them, they talk to me.

238
00:14:04,197 --> 00:14:05,999
MEG: Doesn't mean
you have to answer.

239
00:14:06,001 --> 00:14:08,400
CHARLES WALLACE: Now,
that's just bad manners, Meg.

240
00:14:08,402 --> 00:14:10,336
MEG: (SIGHS) Charles Wallace.

241
00:14:10,338 --> 00:14:11,504
Hey, buddy!

242
00:14:11,506 --> 00:14:12,705
How's it going?

243
00:14:12,707 --> 00:14:14,142
MAN: I'm cool.

244
00:14:14,876 --> 00:14:16,411
Hello, princess.

245
00:14:18,713 --> 00:14:20,580
CHARLES WALLACE: See?
Told ya.

246
00:14:20,582 --> 00:14:22,485
MEG: (SIGHS)
Yeah, be yourself.

247
00:14:25,721 --> 00:14:27,887
Don't be like me.

248
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:29,792
CALVIN: What's wrong
with being like you?

249
00:14:31,392 --> 00:14:32,994
You have a pretty good arm.

250
00:14:34,462 --> 00:14:35,497
Veronica.

251
00:14:36,263 --> 00:14:37,466
Direct hit.

252
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,199
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

253
00:14:40,201 --> 00:14:42,234
Hi. I'm Charles Wallace,
Meg's brother.

254
00:14:42,236 --> 00:14:44,305
- You're Calvin, aren't you?
- CALVIN: That I am.

255
00:14:45,707 --> 00:14:47,443
What are you doing here?

256
00:14:48,143 --> 00:14:49,779
I don't know.

257
00:14:50,578 --> 00:14:52,445
I was doing my homework...

258
00:14:52,447 --> 00:14:53,647
and suddenly
I got this feeling

259
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:54,950
that I had to come here.

260
00:14:55,784 --> 00:14:57,484
Like, right here.

261
00:14:57,486 --> 00:14:58,520
Is that weird?

262
00:14:59,954 --> 00:15:01,553
Maybe a little.

263
00:15:01,555 --> 00:15:04,657
CHARLES WALLACE: The truth is,
you were called here.

264
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:06,993
You're good at diplomacy.

265
00:15:06,995 --> 00:15:09,428
What do we need diplomacy for,
Charles Wallace?

266
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:13,032
Well, the fact that you asked
is exactly why we need it.

267
00:15:13,034 --> 00:15:15,136
So what do you say, Calvin,
you wanna come with us?

268
00:15:18,073 --> 00:15:19,073
Sure.

269
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,575
Why not?

270
00:15:22,043 --> 00:15:23,409
CHARLES WALLACE: Great.

271
00:15:23,411 --> 00:15:25,346
Let's go meet Mrs. Who.

272
00:15:25,981 --> 00:15:28,280
MEG: No! No, Charles Wallace!

273
00:15:28,282 --> 00:15:30,350
Charles Wallace,
do not go in there.

274
00:15:30,352 --> 00:15:33,219
That house is falling apart,
it's off-limits.

275
00:15:33,221 --> 00:15:35,455
He's a fearless
little guy.

276
00:15:35,457 --> 00:15:37,393
(SIGHS) Unfortunately.

277
00:15:39,461 --> 00:15:41,027
I told you no.

278
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:43,730
We cannot go in there.
It's not safe.

279
00:15:43,732 --> 00:15:46,700
It's practically
the safest place...

280
00:15:46,702 --> 00:15:48,500
in the universe.

281
00:15:48,502 --> 00:15:50,506
(MUSIC PLAYING)

282
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,410
CALVIN: Look.

283
00:16:10,626 --> 00:16:12,457
Mrs. Who, it's me,
Charles Wallace.

284
00:16:12,459 --> 00:16:14,463
(LAUGHS) Oh.

285
00:16:33,582 --> 00:16:35,347
MRS. WHO:
"Life without love...

286
00:16:35,349 --> 00:16:38,353
"is like a tree
without blossoms or fruit."

287
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,891
Gibran, Lebanese.

288
00:16:43,724 --> 00:16:46,560
Calvin. Uh, American.

289
00:16:46,562 --> 00:16:47,693
CHARLES WALLACE:
Mrs. Who prefers

290
00:16:47,695 --> 00:16:49,261
not to think for herself.

291
00:16:49,263 --> 00:16:52,132
MEG: That's just rude,
Charles Wallace.

292
00:16:52,134 --> 00:16:54,866
No. She's just evolved
past language...

293
00:16:54,868 --> 00:16:56,568
so when
she needs to think...

294
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:59,739
she cheats and uses
other people's words.

295
00:16:59,741 --> 00:17:01,774
It's nice how
she gives them credit.

296
00:17:01,776 --> 00:17:04,947
Mrs. Who, meet my Meg.

297
00:17:09,383 --> 00:17:10,385
MEG: Okay.

298
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:12,554
Okay.

299
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:20,429
"The wound is the place where
the light enters you."

300
00:17:22,631 --> 00:17:25,233
Rumi, Persian.

301
00:17:33,842 --> 00:17:35,742
CHARLES WALLACE:
(SIGHS) Poor Mrs. Who.

302
00:17:35,744 --> 00:17:37,141
We tired her out.

303
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:39,279
CALVIN: I guess she was
really tired. (CHUCKLES)

304
00:17:40,381 --> 00:17:42,113
CHARLES WALLACE:
She's still adjusting.

305
00:17:42,115 --> 00:17:44,118
MEG: Adjusting to what?

306
00:17:45,019 --> 00:17:46,887
CHARLES WALLACE:
Sorry, you're almost,

307
00:17:46,889 --> 00:17:48,854
but not quite ready
to find out.

308
00:17:48,856 --> 00:17:50,254
MEG: Charles Wallace...

309
00:17:50,256 --> 00:17:53,327
whatever she is, whatever that
is, whatever all this is...

310
00:17:53,329 --> 00:17:54,561
I don't like it.

311
00:17:54,563 --> 00:17:55,631
You'll manage.

312
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:00,068
Come on, time to go.
Let's let Mrs. Who rest.

313
00:18:00,935 --> 00:18:03,339
We'll see her again
very soon.

314
00:18:08,008 --> 00:18:09,174
MEG: Charles Wallace,
can you, um,

315
00:18:09,176 --> 00:18:10,579
pass me the pepper, please?

316
00:18:11,379 --> 00:18:12,844
Thank you.

317
00:18:12,846 --> 00:18:14,213
CHARLES WALLACE:
So, they met in college.

318
00:18:14,215 --> 00:18:15,881
She was tutoring him.

319
00:18:15,883 --> 00:18:17,850
It's a great story,
actually.

320
00:18:17,852 --> 00:18:19,253
CALVIN: Oh, really?

321
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,390
Is that his work?

322
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,591
CHARLES WALLACE:
Mommy's, too.
