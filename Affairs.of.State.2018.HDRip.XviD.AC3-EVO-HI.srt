00:02:44,003 --> 00:02:45,939
Tell me about yourself,
what's your background?

29
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:47,275
Where'd you go to school?

30
00:02:47,841 --> 00:02:49,340
I graduated from GW.

31
00:02:49,342 --> 00:02:51,342
Hmm. What did
you major in?

32
00:02:51,344 --> 00:02:53,881
Political Science with
a minor in Journalism.

33
00:02:54,681 --> 00:02:55,582
What kind of grades?

34
00:02:56,216 --> 00:02:57,617
Graduated with honors.

35
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:58,752

[Michael] <i>Mary Maple.</i>

<i>A very good person
to know in Washington.</i>

41
00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:10,298
So, how can I
help you, Michael?

42
00:03:11,764 --> 00:03:13,231
Well, it's pretty clear
that Senator Baines

43
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:14,634
is gonna run for president.

44
00:03:16,302 --> 00:03:18,639
If I can be anywhere
near that, I mean...

45
00:03:20,907 --> 00:03:22,276
I could learn a lot
from the man.

46
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:25,947
Well, John is a good friend.

47
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,283
- Nothing is set in stone, of course.
- No, no, of course.

48
00:03:29,782 --> 00:03:32,250
Rob Reynolds is unofficially
running the campaign.

49
00:03:32,252 --> 00:03:34,886
I have heard of him, although I
haven't made his acquaintance.

50
00:03:34,888 --> 00:03:37,024
Rob is also
a good friend.

51
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:38,693
He's the best at what he does.

52
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,294
Yes, he is.

53
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:51,102
Consider yourself invited to
the Maple Foundation event,

54
00:03:51,104 --> 00:03:54,809
where my good friend John Boland
Baines is our guest speaker.

55
00:03:55,741 --> 00:03:58,812
I'll even introduce you
to Rob Reynolds myself.

56
00:04:01,381 --> 00:04:03,818
I'd very much appreciate that, Mrs.
Maple.

57
00:04:05,051 --> 00:04:06,287
Call me Mary.

58
00:04:07,753 --> 00:04:09,721

00:04:09,723 --> 00:04:12,056
Oh! My goodness!

Oh! My! Oh, darlin'! Michael!

61
00:04:15,795 --> 00:04:17,796
Darlin', I need you...
I need you...

62
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:19,199
I need you to stop
for a minute.

63
00:04:20,966 --> 00:04:24,871
Oh. Oh. Oh.

- Hey.
- What?

67
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:41,385
Where'd you go?
I'm in here.

68

[chuckles]

69
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:54,701
You know, I like you
better without it.

70
00:04:55,367 --> 00:04:56,968
You mean you
don't like my wig?

71
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,372
No, no, no.
I like your wig.

72
00:04:59,206 --> 00:05:00,374
I mean, here.

73
00:05:00,906 --> 00:05:01,975
Now.

74
00:05:05,045 --> 00:05:06,112
I like you like this.

75
00:05:07,848 --> 00:05:09,817
[sighs] You do?

76
00:05:11,785 --> 00:05:14,786
Oh, sugar, you really
are something.

[Michael] <i>A little over a
year ago, at a lunch counter,</i>

82
00:05:34,074 --> 00:05:36,173
<i>my boss,
Senator Lester Garret,</i>

83
00:05:36,175 --> 00:05:38,012
<i>told me he had a pain
in his abdomen.</i>

84
00:05:39,346 --> 00:05:42,716
<i>Less than two months later,
Lester died of pancreatic cancer.</i>

85
00:05:43,983 --> 00:05:45,485
<i>I'd been out of work
ever since.</i>

86
00:05:46,552 --> 00:05:48,021
<i>I had to make something happen.</i>

87
00:05:48,788 --> 00:05:51,324
<i>I was on borrowed time
in a borrowed SUV.</i>

88
00:06:03,435 --> 00:06:04,871
That Judge Karl?

89
00:06:06,372 --> 00:06:07,474
How did you get this?

90
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:11,308
Callie, Judge Karl
has a wife and kids.

91
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,810
Precisely.

92
00:06:12,812 --> 00:06:14,913
And he's been
a judicial activist

93
00:06:14,915 --> 00:06:17,514
against same-sex marriage
for his entire career.

94
00:06:17,516 --> 00:06:20,517
Some of his legal language was
actually in DOMA, for Christ's sakes.

95
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:24,154
I mean, he's a hypocrite
of the highest order.

96
00:06:24,156 --> 00:06:26,926
[Michael] <i>Callie and I met when we
were both interning for Lester.</i>

97
00:06:27,293 --> 00:06:29,896
Yeah, but, Callie...

98
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,132
wife and kids.

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,300
Yeah, you're right, I can't
do that to the wife and kids.

100
00:06:36,302 --> 00:06:39,336
[Michael] <i>She's my roommate and
my best friend. But lately...</i>

101
00:06:39,338 --> 00:06:40,240
I'll blackmail him.

102
00:06:41,608 --> 00:06:43,009
How much do you think
we would get?

103
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,211
Not much, honestly.

104
00:06:45,911 --> 00:06:47,512
[scoffs]

105
00:06:47,514 --> 00:06:49,150

<i>Most of those guys weren't
exactly big players, though.</i>

<i>The judge tape...</i>

108
00:06:54,086 --> 00:06:55,389
<i>This was different.</i>

109
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,992
You know,
in this little box...

110
00:07:00,526 --> 00:07:02,159
is the real DC.

111
00:07:02,161 --> 00:07:03,560
Yeah, and it's going to
stay in that box.

112
00:07:03,562 --> 00:07:04,865
For a rainy day.

113
00:07:05,398 --> 00:07:06,500
Speaking of rainy days...

114
00:07:07,067 --> 00:07:09,033
umm, how we doing on rent?

115
00:07:09,035 --> 00:07:11,071
[sighs] 'Cause, uh,
that's a final notice.

116
00:07:11,403 --> 00:07:14,574
Yeah, we're probably going to
have to bust out the umbrellas.

117
00:07:15,175 --> 00:07:16,110
Really?

118

[clears throat]

119
00:07:19,913 --> 00:07:22,079
That was a gift
from Tanya.

120
00:07:22,081 --> 00:07:24,182
Oh, how nice of her.

121
00:07:24,184 --> 00:07:25,617
Did you ever consider
selling the coke?

122
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:28,485
Michael, I can't
sell a gift.

123
00:07:28,487 --> 00:07:30,255
We have to pay rent.

124
00:07:30,257 --> 00:07:31,458
I know.

125
00:07:32,024 --> 00:07:35,862
[sighs] Whatever are we to do?

126
00:07:53,213 --> 00:07:55,015
[Michael] <i>This is

132
00:08:04,925 --> 00:08:07,093
I wanna work

133
00:08:08,194 --> 00:08:10,428
I want a rim job

it's gonna happen.

All right, so what is it
you actually want, Michael?

137
00:08:16,435 --> 00:08:17,904
I mean, let's say you...

138
00:08:18,103 --> 00:08:20,306
you get the job,
and Baines became president?

139

Where do you see yourself?
Humor me.

140
00:08:23,543 --> 00:08:25,409
I see myself running
for Congress.

141
00:08:25,411 --> 00:08:26,479
And I see myself winning.

142

a resident of any state?

Where's the Podunk town
you come from?

146
00:08:34,586 --> 00:08:36,353
It's not about where I'm from,
it's where I'm going.

[laughing]

148
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,193
That should be your
campaign slogan.

149
00:08:40,994 --> 00:08:42,663
Rob Reynolds will never
take you seriously.

150
00:08:43,495 --> 00:08:44,597
What if I told you...

151
00:08:45,731 --> 00:08:47,900
that Rob Reynolds is going
to have to take me seriously.

152
00:08:51,971 --> 00:08:52,906
If it were me...

153

I'd go to Reynolds like
I'm doing him a favor.

protect my sources...

Does Callie have
anything to do with this?

All right, two things,

157
00:09:07,086 --> 00:09:09,389
and I want you to listen
to me, very carefully.

158
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,991
Do not let Reynolds know

that you want to
run for Congress,

- And?
- And...

162
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:21,001
just be careful.

163
00:09:22,335 --> 00:09:24,204
These aren't Boy Scouts
you're dealing with.

[Michael]
<i>The Maple Foundation fundraiser.</i>

165
00:09:35,315 --> 00:09:38,585
<i>An annual event to raise money
for Mary's various causes.</i>

166
00:09:40,552 --> 00:09:44,055
<i>In this case, the cause
was the United Party.</i>

167
00:09:44,057 --> 00:09:45,158
Excuse me, sir.

168
00:10:09,615 --> 00:10:11,284
[Michael] <i>Rob Reynolds.</i>

169
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,651
<i>A wunderkind who had gotten
his first congressman elected</i>

170
00:10:13,653 --> 00:10:15,221
<i>before his 25th birthday.</i>

171
00:10:18,124 --> 00:10:19,692
<i>His tactics: questioned.</i>

172
00:10:20,259 --> 00:10:22,096
<i>His resolve: feared.</i>

173
00:10:28,467 --> 00:10:30,501
<i>Rob Reynolds had
started a new party</i>

174
00:10:30,503 --> 00:10:33,206
<i>and Senator Baines
was gonna be the face of it.</i>

175
00:10:35,841 --> 00:10:39,109
This is not about this year,
it's not about this election,

176
00:10:39,111 --> 00:10:41,278
- it's about the next elec...
- Rob, darlin'.

177
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,548
Excuse me, gentlemen.

178
00:10:42,816 --> 00:10:45,386
I wonder if you've
met Michael Lawson.

179
00:10:45,751 --> 00:10:48,085
Michael is... Well, Michael...

180
00:10:48,087 --> 00:10:50,223
Uh, Michael would do
anything to get onboard.

181
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:53,523
Oh, yeah, well,
good luck, Michael.

182
00:10:53,525 --> 00:10:55,228
Uh, Mary.

183
00:10:57,697 --> 00:11:01,668
[sighs] Don't worry,
darlin', I'll work on him.

184
00:11:05,138 --> 00:11:07,206
[Michael] <i>Well, Kevin had
been right about one thing,</i>

185
00:11:07,474 --> 00:11:09,343
<i>Reynolds was never going
to take me seriously.</i>

186
00:11:09,775 --> 00:11:11,110
<i>I had known that.</i>

187
00:11:12,345 --> 00:11:14,148
<i>But Mary had kept her promise
and gotten me the introduction.</i>

188
00:11:14,614 --> 00:11:15,749
<i>The rest was up to me.</i>

189
00:11:16,783 --> 00:11:19,749
Lydia Bowman. New Year's
Eve a couple years ago.

190
00:11:19,751 --> 00:11:22,453
Senator Barr's party, you were
Rob Reynolds's assistant.

191
00:11:22,455 --> 00:11:24,821
Executive assistant.
Of course, of course.

192
00:11:24,823 --> 00:11:26,159
Michael.

193
00:11:26,493 --> 00:11:28,328
Lawson, yeah, I know.

194
00:11:28,861 --> 00:11:32,231
Lydia, I was wondering
if maybe you...

195
00:11:32,565 --> 00:11:35,465
- Oh, Michael, I'm here with someone.
- I know.

196
00:11:35,467 --> 00:11:38,504
I was wondering if maybe you'd
give this to Mr. Reynolds for me.

197
00:11:40,373 --> 00:11:42,408
Oh, I...
I thought...

198
00:11:43,143 --> 00:11:45,278
- Now I'm embarrassed.
- No, don't be.

199
00:11:46,312 --> 00:11:47,648
I knew you were
here with someone.

200
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,083
My great misfortune.

201
00:11:54,586 --> 00:11:56,521
I'll give this to Rob.
Thank you.

202
00:11:56,523 --> 00:11:58,625
- [applause]
- [Mary] <i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

203
00:11:59,525 --> 00:12:01,194
<i>my dear friends,</i>

204
00:12:01,461 --> 00:12:03,831
I would like to welcome you
to this party.

205
00:12:04,663 --> 00:12:09,436
And when I say this party, I am not
just talking about this event,

206
00:12:09,869 --> 00:12:12,435
I am talking about a movement.

207
00:12:12,437 --> 00:12:14,441
[all] Yes!
[cheering]

208
00:12:16,475 --> 00:12:21,679
Unlike that broken
Grand Old Party...

209
00:12:21,681 --> 00:12:23,647
[audience laughing]

210
00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:25,849
...this party is United.

211
00:12:25,851 --> 00:12:28,419
[man] Yeah!
[cheering]

212
00:12:28,421 --> 00:12:30,456
Without further ado,

213
00:12:30,756 --> 00:12:34,327
I'm going to give you the man who's
here to get this party started.

214
00:12:34,693 --> 00:12:40,263
From the great state of Texas,
Senator John Boland Baines!

215
00:12:40,265 --> 00:12:42,135
[cheering]

216
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,750
Thank you! Thank you!

217
00:12:58,283 --> 00:13:00,287
Let's get right to it,
shall we?

218
00:13:01,486 --> 00:13:02,355
What has happened to us?

219
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:06,426
When did we become so angry?
So divided?

220
00:13:06,725 --> 00:13:09,395
[Baines] <i>Why has the voice
of compromise become silent?</i>

221
00:13:11,831 --> 00:13:13,667
Don't let anyone in
until the speech ends.

222
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:19,302
What does this mean?
I wanted your attention.

223
00:13:19,304 --> 00:13:20,274
You have it.

224
00:13:21,274 --> 00:13:23,907
Yes, okay, I'm, uh...
I'm...

225
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:26,579
[Baines]
<i>...run by extortionists.</i>

226
00:13:33,485 --> 00:13:35,621
<i>We can unite behind being...</i>
[audio muffles]

227
00:13:37,356 --> 00:13:38,759
I'm in possession of
a thumb drive.

228
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,895
On this drive is a video
of a certain prominent judge.

229
00:13:43,395 --> 00:13:45,463
Very close friend
of the Senator's

230
00:13:45,465 --> 00:13:46,833
and likely to end up on your short
list for the Supreme Court.

231
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,403
In the video,
this judge is...

232
00:13:51,638 --> 00:13:52,670
How do I put this?

233
00:13:52,672 --> 00:13:54,740
In plain English, please.

234
00:13:57,476 --> 00:13:58,978
He's blowing a guy
in a bathroom stall.

235
00:14:02,715 --> 00:14:06,483
[Baines] <i>We can do it,
we can be united!</i>

236
00:14:06,485 --> 00:14:07,788
[audience cheering]

237
00:14:08,921 --> 00:14:11,821
We have people who want
to overthrow the government.

238
00:14:11,823 --> 00:14:14,995
People who want to secede from the Union
because things haven't gone their way.

239
00:14:15,595 --> 00:14:17,795
- Well, that's just not American.
- [audience members] No.

240
00:14:17,797 --> 00:14:20,567
United we stand and divided...

241
00:14:23,403 --> 00:14:24,868
we have failed.

242
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,840
Do you know how Bobby
Kennedy was assassinated?

243
00:14:30,909 --> 00:14:33,279
It was in a kitchen.
A lot like this one.

244
00:14:35,447 --> 00:14:37,850
A little nothing
changed history.

245
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,620
A lot can be
learned from that.

246
00:14:40,052 --> 00:14:41,922
The United Party.

247
00:14:43,556 --> 00:14:44,958
Sounds nice, doesn't it?

248
00:14:48,927 --> 00:14:49,895
What do you want?

249
00:14:51,364 --> 00:14:52,365
I want a job.

250
00:14:52,999 --> 00:14:53,933
Sir.

251
00:14:57,736 --> 00:14:59,972
- Look, I'm not asking you to...
- Shh, shh, shh.

252
00:15:00,505 --> 00:15:02,942
[Baines] <i>We're not determined
to tear down the machinery.</i>

253
00:15:04,374 --> 00:15:05,910
We believe that the
interests of the individual

254
00:15:05,912 --> 00:15:08,749
should be left to the people
involved, not the government!

255
00:15:10,982 --> 00:15:13,286
What if I told you
I won't give you a job?

256
00:15:13,653 --> 00:15:14,855
Hmm? What do you do then?

257
00:15:16,688 --> 00:15:18,024
I hand the drive over to you.

258
00:15:19,392 --> 00:15:20,458
As a friend.

259
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,528
A friend of mine?

260
00:15:24,062 --> 00:15:25,396
A friend of the party.

261
00:15:25,398 --> 00:15:27,964
[audience cheering]

262
00:15:27,966 --> 00:15:30,600
[Baines] <i>We believe
in a free market,</i>

263
00:15:30,602 --> 00:15:33,671
<i>but be prepared to act
when it fails,</i>

264
00:15:33,673 --> 00:15:35,473
<i>or when it is abused.</i>

265
00:15:35,475 --> 00:15:38,575
I believe that we can be
against needless regulations

266
00:15:38,577 --> 00:15:43,049
and yet not deny that our planet
is warming and we must act.

267
00:15:43,816 --> 00:15:46,150
I believe that we can
be pro-business

268
00:15:46,152 --> 00:15:48,651
<i>and still not be held captive
by the vested interests</i>

269
00:15:48,653 --> 00:15:50,590
<i>of billionaires
and corporations.</i>

270
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:54,328
Welcome to the show,
Michael.

271
00:15:55,727 --> 00:15:57,863
We can be united!

272
00:16:02,467 --> 00:16:03,769
United Party!

273
00:16:05,071 --> 00:16:06,840
[crowd] Baines! Baines! Baines!

274
00:16:07,807 --> 00:16:09,810
Thank you.
Excuse me... Rob.

275
00:16:12,511 --> 00:16:13,844
What'd you think
of the speech?

276
00:16:13,846 --> 00:16:15,912
Very moving, sir,
very presidential.

277
00:16:15,914 --> 00:16:17,915
Let's hope it goes as well
when we make it official, huh?

278
00:16:17,917 --> 00:16:19,386
Of course you will.

279
00:16:19,684 --> 00:16:22,355
I have good news,
Darcy's comin' home.

280
00:16:23,623 --> 00:16:26,022
We'll have to throw a grand ol'
welcome home party for her, won't we?

281
00:16:26,024 --> 00:16:27,757
Yes, we will.
Yes, we will.

282
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:28,995
Who is this?

283
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:33,700
Oh, uh, Senator,
this is Michael Lawson.

284
00:16:34,133 --> 00:16:35,435
He's gonna be working for us.

285
00:16:35,868 --> 00:16:37,104
Fantastic!

286
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,703
Well, welcome aboard, Michael.
Thank you, sir.

287
00:16:39,705 --> 00:16:40,970
You're a good-looking kid,
you know that?

288
00:16:40,972 --> 00:16:42,475
[chuckles]
Thank you, sir.

289
00:16:42,841 --> 00:16:43,909
Isn't he?

290
00:16:44,443 --> 00:16:45,444
Isn't he, Judith?

291
00:16:46,645 --> 00:16:47,747
Uh, isn't who what?

292
00:16:48,047 --> 00:16:49,747
Darling,
I was just saying,

293
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:51,015
Michael Lawson here
is coming to work for us.

294
00:16:51,017 --> 00:16:53,086
I said he was
a good-looking young man.

295
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,022
- Don't you think?
- Yes.

296
00:16:57,123 --> 00:16:59,526
And that is so important
in a campaign.

297
00:17:03,863 --> 00:17:05,094
I'm glad you're with us,

298
00:17:05,096 --> 00:17:06,700
this campaign needs youth.

299
00:17:06,999 --> 00:17:08,067
Thank you, sir.

300
00:17:09,868 --> 00:17:11,771
Excuse me. Vonetta!

301
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,643
Senator Baines.

302
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,913
You were smart
with me today.

303
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,048
Keep it up.

304
00:17:25,484 --> 00:17:26,852
I want that flash drive.

305
00:17:34,192 --> 00:17:36,863

[hip-hop music playing, on

312
00:18:23,075 --> 00:18:25,676
Well, if it looks like a duck
and it quacks like a duck,

313
00:18:25,678 --> 00:18:29,015
it's probably a judge blowing a guy
in the bathroom stall. [chuckles]

314
00:18:29,248 --> 00:18:31,183
- It's the only copy, I wiped it...
- What?

315
00:18:31,584 --> 00:18:32,885
It's the only copy.

316
00:18:33,184 --> 00:18:35,286
I wiped the computer
and the original sources...

317
00:18:35,288 --> 00:18:37,921
How do I know it's not out there
floating in the cloud somewhere

318
00:18:37,923 --> 00:18:39,556
just waiting
to be downloaded?

319
00:18:39,558 --> 00:18:41,292
You don't.
You just gotta trust me.

320
00:18:41,294 --> 00:18:42,629
But I don't trust anyone.

321
00:18:56,741 --> 00:18:58,845
- I don't follow.
- There's nothing to follow.

322
00:19:00,246 --> 00:19:02,278
The senator's daughter
coming into town,

323
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,748
I'm gonna need you to go on
over there and help out Judith.

324
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,951
Yeah, sure, absolutely.
Uh, anything to help out.

325
00:19:07,953 --> 00:19:10,856
Hey, is Callie Roland
looking for a job?

326
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:13,026
Find out.

327
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,292
We'll pay her, she'll continue
to do what she does best,

328
00:19:15,294 --> 00:19:16,863
destroy bad people.

329
00:19:17,096 --> 00:19:18,230
Everybody wins.

330
00:19:19,432 --> 00:19:21,535
- [phone rings -And I paid
your next six months' rent.

331
00:19:22,335 --> 00:19:24,634
- Oh, I didn't ask you to...
- Forget it. It's done.

332
00:19:24,636 --> 00:19:26,005
Go talk to Lydia,
I need to grab this.

333
00:19:26,739 --> 00:19:28,905
Hey, hey! Mad Cash!

334
00:19:28,907 --> 00:19:30,943
I was just listening
to your latest hit.

335
00:19:31,242 --> 00:19:32,809
Oh, man, it's a smash.

336

[man rapping]

337
00:19:40,786 --> 00:19:44,622
[Michael] <i>Wallace Pellum, aka Mad
Cash, was a high school dropout</i>

338
00:19:44,624 --> 00:19:48,225

341
00:19:52,832 --> 00:19:54,765
So why should I want to get the
vote out for your candidate?

342
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:56,933
[Michael] <i>Rob Reynolds
had plans for this new party.</i>

343
00:19:56,935 --> 00:19:59,670
<i>And in his mind, Mad Cash
would play a big part in it.</i>

You going to church
tomorrow?

345
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:01,707
Yes, I am.

346
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,144
You know I believe in God.
Well, so am I.

347
00:20:04,676 --> 00:20:06,812
Tomorrow could be
the revolution, Wallace.

348
00:20:07,078 --> 00:20:11,347
I mean, we have the real party,
this time we get it right.

349
00:20:11,349 --> 00:20:13,185
And the Latino vote too.

350
00:20:13,786 --> 00:20:15,285
Good, my babies
are half Latino.

351
00:20:15,287 --> 00:20:16,855
Exactly! You see?

352
00:20:17,189 --> 00:20:18,721
We're aligned.

353
00:20:18,723 --> 00:20:21,392
Me, you, Baines,
and the United Part

354

the right.

355
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:25,065
Yeah, well...

356
00:20:26,965 --> 00:20:28,200
we may have your values,

357
00:20:29,201 --> 00:20:30,804
but we still just
niggers to you.

358
00:20:33,172 --> 00:20:35,909
Well, you have to find
your place in the party.

359
00:20:36,275 --> 00:20:38,678
And you might as well be
sitting with the big boys.

360
00:20:41,413 --> 00:20:42,648
True that, my brother.

361
00:20:43,148 --> 00:20:44,116
True that.

they were tight.</i>

Really? No one's gonna
sit up front with me?

365
00:20:53,192 --> 00:20:54,294
Let's just hit the road, Jack.

366
00:20:54,693 --> 00:20:56,959
Ooh! You looking
real good, Mike.

367
00:20:56,961 --> 00:20:58,163
Thank you, Tanya.

368
00:20:58,897 --> 00:21:00,698
[Tanya] You want a bump? A bump?

369
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,966
- Yes!
- No, no, I'm all right.

370
00:21:02,968 --> 00:21:05,268
[Michael] <i>Tanya had come

Hey, Tanya...
[Callie] No!

374
00:21:11,443 --> 00:21:13,744
- You can't borrow the SUV again...
- Yes.

375
00:21:13,746 --> 00:21:16,447
You can borrow my SUV for
as long as you want, baby!

376
00:21:16,449 --> 00:21:18,114
Thank you, Tanya.
[Callie] Why are you so nice?

377
00:21:18,116 --> 00:21:19,749
'Cause I love him.

No, you don't.
I do.

[Michael] <i>Like I said,
they were... tight.</i>

380
00:21:33,798 --> 00:21:37,369
[Judith] I like the cut glass, but I
don't care for anything iridescent.

381
00:21:37,936 --> 00:21:39,104
Okay, then. Yeah.

382
00:21:40,338 --> 00:21:42,274
And then, um, cut glass.

383
00:21:42,842 --> 00:21:44,341
And I like the silver,
I don't want...

384
00:21:44,343 --> 00:21:46,211
[clears throat]
Uh, Mrs. Baines.

385
00:21:47,378 --> 00:21:48,347
Hi.

386
00:21:49,481 --> 00:21:50,817
An SUV?

387
00:21:52,417 --> 00:21:54,186
I'll be inside.

388
00:21:55,721 --> 00:21:57,057
[Michael] <i>Mrs. Baines was an
environmentally conscious conservative.</i>

389
00:21:58,758 --> 00:22:00,125
You really have to
get rid of that.

390
00:22:00,492 --> 00:22:01,394
Sit down.

391
00:22:02,595 --> 00:22:06,028
Young man traveling around as
a single passenger in an SUV,

392
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,864
do you have any idea
the carbon footprint...

393
00:22:07,866 --> 00:22:09,469
- You won't see it again.
- Good.

394
00:22:10,001 --> 00:22:11,468
One of the things
that bothers me the most

395
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,906
about my husband
and this campaign is that

396
00:22:14,306 --> 00:22:16,109
he'll no longer travel
on a commercial airline.

397
00:22:16,307 --> 00:22:18,542
I mean, he's going to be traveling
around on a private jet.

398
00:22:18,544 --> 00:22:20,878
Yeah, those small planes,
they make me nervous too.

399
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,247
No, it's about
the fuel consumption.

400
00:22:23,249 --> 00:22:25,181
Those things are the worst.

401
00:22:25,183 --> 00:22:27,250
Listen, you have to understand,
this campaign is going to be

402
00:22:27,252 --> 00:22:29,318
a cross between
the Reagan philosophy

403
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,088
and when Jimmy Carter had solar panels
installed on the White House roof.

404
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,524
They worked wonderfully.

405
00:22:33,526 --> 00:22:35,926
You're probably too young
to remember any of this.

406
00:22:35,928 --> 00:22:38,796
Unfortunately, they were dismantled
during the Reagan administration.

407
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:42,134
It's the only blemish on an
otherwise perfect presidency.

408
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:45,238
So...

409
00:22:46,271 --> 00:22:48,307
Mary Maple tells me
you have a beautiful cock.

410
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:50,809
Oh...

411
00:22:51,911 --> 00:22:53,046
Sorry, what?

412
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,448
[sighs] Come with me.

413
00:22:57,082 --> 00:22:59,850
Oh! You should think
about getting a Volt.

414
00:22:59,852 --> 00:23:01,250
Not only are they
American-made,

415
00:23:01,252 --> 00:23:03,388
but they run on
gas and electric.

416
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,787
[softly]
Look at this.

417
00:23:50,336 --> 00:23:51,471
I can't do this.

418
00:23:52,538 --> 00:23:53,472
Really?

419
00:23:54,506 --> 00:23:56,509
I see evidence
to the contrary.

420
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:59,112
This is wrong.

421
00:23:59,345 --> 00:24:00,947
I don't feel
right about this.

422
00:24:01,614 --> 00:24:03,516
[sighs] You know
how you got here.

423
00:24:06,184 --> 00:24:07,586
I know how
you got here.

424
00:24:24,435 --> 00:24:25,571
Get up.

425
00:24:31,676 --> 00:24:33,512
What...
what are you doing?

426
00:24:34,212 --> 00:24:36,883

Now you can.

430
00:25:47,385 --> 00:25:48,651
Excuse me?

431
00:25:48,653 --> 00:25:49,923
I'm working for
Senator Baines.

432
00:25:51,123 --> 00:25:53,625
[laughing]

433
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:55,459
Yeah, right.

434
00:25:55,461 --> 00:25:56,461
Yeah, no, I'm serious.

435
00:25:57,096 --> 00:25:58,364
[chuckles] Come on.

436
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,430
- It just happened, Callie...
- No.

437
00:26:00,432 --> 00:26:02,969
No, things like this
don't just happen.

438
00:26:03,268 --> 00:26:05,401
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

439
00:26:05,403 --> 00:26:08,438
Why would they even hire you knowing
your history, our politics?

440
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,007
It just doesn't...
Yeah, well,

441
00:26:10,009 --> 00:26:12,174
that, uh, brings me
to my other thing.

442
00:26:12,176 --> 00:26:13,545
- There's a second thing?
- Yeah.

443
00:26:14,779 --> 00:26:16,214
I gave them
the thumb drive.

444
00:26:17,648 --> 00:26:18,748
What thumb drive?

445
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,153
The Judge Karl video.

446
00:26:20,451 --> 00:26:21,954
I gave it
to Rob Reynolds.

447
00:26:22,387 --> 00:26:23,588
He's the one that
offered me the job.

448
00:26:28,027 --> 00:26:29,328
Are you fucking
kidding me?

449
00:26:30,695 --> 00:26:32,395
That was mine.

450
00:26:32,397 --> 00:26:34,398
- Well, okay, it was sort of yours.
- No!

451
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,033
These are mine!

452
00:26:36,035 --> 00:26:37,437
Okay, Callie, well,
I had to do something.

453
00:26:37,736 --> 00:26:40,303
I had to make a move because we
were drowning, you know that.

454
00:26:40,305 --> 00:26:41,571
I mean, come on, look.

455
00:26:41,573 --> 00:26:43,039
I give the drive
to Rob Reynolds,

456
00:26:43,041 --> 00:26:44,074
he pays our rent
for the next six months.

457
00:26:44,076 --> 00:26:44,743
Look at this.

458
00:26:45,944 --> 00:26:47,646
That's more money than you've
seen in your whole life.

459
00:26:48,847 --> 00:26:50,180
Plus the reality is, now
that they've seen the video,

460
00:26:50,182 --> 00:26:52,748
no way Judge Karl's getting
nominated for the Supreme Court,

461
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,217
so frankly,
it's a win-win.

462
00:26:54,219 --> 00:26:55,151
Win-win?

463
00:26:55,153 --> 00:26:57,421
Michael, this is insane.

464
00:26:57,423 --> 00:27:00,356
Goddamn it, are you for real?
The United Party?

465
00:27:00,358 --> 00:27:03,192
Okay, yes. But Baines
is actually different.

466
00:27:03,194 --> 00:27:05,062
- He's a fascist.
- Fa... [scoffs]

467
00:27:05,064 --> 00:27:06,395
Come on, Cal!
What does that even mean?

468
00:27:06,397 --> 00:27:08,364
You know what it means!

469
00:27:08,366 --> 00:27:09,665
They'll sell guns to
seven-year-olds, while they laugh

470
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:11,535
as cops fucking kill
people in the street!

471
00:27:11,537 --> 00:27:14,403
The want to de-unionize,
deregulate the entire universe.

472
00:27:14,405 --> 00:27:16,506
They'll sell us food that

00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:22,941
Dallas?

634
00:38:24,409 --> 00:38:25,943
Nothing bad ever
happened there.

635
00:38:27,112 --> 00:38:28,213
I have to take a piss.

636
00:38:39,824 --> 00:38:41,389
[Michael] <i>I had heard
Jerry Todd was looking</i>

637
00:38:41,391 --> 00:38:43,361
<i>for someone inside
the Baines campaign.</i>

638
00:38:43,862 --> 00:38:45,898
- [man] How's it hangin'?
- <i>You had to hand it to him,</i>

639
00:38:46,197 --> 00:38:48,865
<i>he had a way of catching you
at your most vulnerable.</i>

640
00:38:48,867 --> 00:38:50,402
Look, you hang
to the left.

641
00:38:51,802 --> 00:38:53,771
You worked for Lester
Garret, didn't you?

642
00:38:55,773 --> 00:39:00,011
So, what do you think you could
do for me if I were to hire you?

643
00:39:03,081 --> 00:39:04,216
Well, Jerry...

644
00:39:06,918 --> 00:39:09,488
I've actually been leaning a
little more to the right recently.

645
00:39:10,521 --> 00:39:12,190
But it's been nice
hanging with you.

646
00:39:12,791 --> 00:39:14,927
Well, let me know if you
ever change your mind.

647
00:39:26,838 --> 00:39:27,940
Good morning.

648
00:39:32,342 --> 00:39:34,413
Did you enjoy yourself
at your party?

649
00:39:35,246 --> 00:39:36,148
Yeah.

650
00:39:37,047 --> 00:39:38,049
Good.

651
00:39:39,117 --> 00:39:42,387
I noticed that you were
dancing with Michael Lawson.

652
00:39:44,088 --> 00:39:45,923
Darcy, now that
your father's...

653
00:39:46,925 --> 00:39:48,393
Well, we need
to be careful.

654
00:39:49,327 --> 00:39:50,329
"Careful."

655
00:39:51,461 --> 00:39:52,630
"We."

656
00:39:53,431 --> 00:39:55,530
<i>You</i> need to be careful
about who you're seen...

657
00:39:55,532 --> 00:39:56,534
Touching?

658
00:39:57,135 --> 00:39:58,237
You know what I mean.

659
00:40:00,405 --> 00:40:02,007
Is this coming
from my father?

660
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,210
Mmm...

661
00:40:05,409 --> 00:40:07,378
Anything regarding the campaign
is coming from the both of us.

662
00:40:10,581 --> 00:40:12,150
We were just dancing.

663
00:40:16,954 --> 00:40:18,456
All right.
[clears throat]

664
00:40:19,489 --> 00:40:21,425
Um...
Enjoy your breakfast.

665
00:40:29,934 --> 00:40:32,568
[interviewer] <i>Senator, you've been
recently criticized by the NAACP</i>

666
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:34,970
<i>for your advocacy
of racial profiling,</i>

667
00:40:34,972 --> 00:40:38,177
<i>yet you claim that you yourself
have never been racially profiled.</i>

668
00:40:38,376 --> 00:40:40,642
[Vonetta] <i>No, not
that I remember.</i>

669
00:40:40,644 --> 00:40:44,382
- <i>Yet, rap mogul Mad Cash...</i>
- <i>Yes. I heard what he had to say.</i>

670
00:40:44,615 --> 00:40:46,949
<i>Calling me a

<i>He is the real problem

00:40:49,653 --> 00:40:52,255
<i>superficial and materialistic.</i>

<i>Dr. King was a rebel.</i>

677

- <i>Mad Cash is a...</i>
- [TV clicks off]

678
00:41:04,568 --> 00:41:05,871
John,

679
00:41:06,938 --> 00:41:09,237
you cannot have Vonetta
Calhoun stand next to you

680
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:10,673
when you announce
your candidacy.

681
00:41:10,675 --> 00:41:13,144
- I can't?
- She will hurt you

682
00:41:13,478 --> 00:41:16,012
more than she will help you
with the black vote.

683
00:41:16,014 --> 00:41:17,182
African-American.

684
00:41:17,414 --> 00:41:19,217
African-American, yes.

685
00:41:20,083 --> 00:41:23,020
I see her down the line
as a possible running mate.

686
00:41:24,389 --> 00:41:26,124
That would be crazy, John.

687
00:41:27,391 --> 00:41:28,426
Senator.

688
00:41:30,094 --> 00:41:31,463
What's your
real problem, Rob?

689
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,999
That she criticized
your rap star buddy?

690
00:41:36,266 --> 00:41:38,169
Senator, sir,

691
00:41:38,603 --> 00:41:41,237
my rap star buddy can walk
into any neighborhood...

692
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:43,606
Caucasian, African-American,
Latino...

693
00:41:43,608 --> 00:41:47,043
and not only register
votes, but get you votes.

694
00:41:47,045 --> 00:41:51,083
He's a cultural icon and a
social media phenomenon.

695
00:41:51,416 --> 00:41:55,153
My rap star buddy...
is a billionaire.

696
00:42:00,525 --> 00:42:03,896
I want Vonetta Calhoun standing
next to me when I announce.

697
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:09,434
And where do you
want Judith?

698
00:42:26,985 --> 00:42:28,687
So, I understand you
worked with Lester Garret.

699
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:32,722
Oh, yes, sir, I interned for
him after I graduated from GW.

700
00:42:32,724 --> 00:42:35,027
That turned into a
full-time position, but...

701
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,362
Well, you know what happened.

702
00:42:39,063 --> 00:42:39,864
Ol' Lester.

703
00:42:41,398 --> 00:42:42,733
I'll say this about
Lester Garret...

704
00:42:44,168 --> 00:42:46,972
he went to bed at the end of the
day believing his own bullshit.

705
00:42:47,672 --> 00:42:49,541
And I mean that
in a positive way.

706
00:42:50,307 --> 00:42:52,076
Yes, sir.
Can I freshen you up?

707
00:42:52,342 --> 00:42:54,478
Oh, no thank you, I'm still
working on this one, sir.

708
00:42:55,646 --> 00:42:58,016
Michael, call me John.

709
00:42:58,382 --> 00:42:59,283
Sure.

710
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:04,556
I had a tendency
to overindulge, so...

711
00:43:05,188 --> 00:43:06,287
It's in the genes.

712
00:43:06,289 --> 00:43:08,190
Is that so?

713
00:43:08,192 --> 00:43:10,628
My father, he did a lot of damage
to his liver, to his family.

714
00:43:11,695 --> 00:43:13,329
Were you close
with your dad?

715
00:43:13,331 --> 00:43:15,300
No, no, he wasn't
around much.

716
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:17,402
How 'bout your mom?

717
00:43:19,804 --> 00:43:21,740
I had an aunt,
her sister.

718
00:43:22,773 --> 00:43:24,108
She was, uh...

719
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:27,179
kind to me.

720
00:43:32,583 --> 00:43:34,215
Can't pick your
family, sir.

721
00:43:34,217 --> 00:43:36,519
[chuckles] Least not
the first time around.

722
00:43:36,521 --> 00:43:37,756
[chuckles]

723
00:43:38,422 --> 00:43:40,091
Nothing harder
than family.

724
00:43:40,791 --> 00:43:42,293
Nothing more important either.

725
00:43:44,628 --> 00:43:46,030
Family, yes, sir.

726
00:43:46,797 --> 00:43:50,101
- And, Michael, call me John.
- Right, yes.

727
00:43:51,768 --> 00:43:54,572
- [pop song playing]
- [woman singing]

728
00:43:56,773 --> 00:43:59,010
[woman rapping]

729
00:44:08,219 --> 00:44:09,688
Who's your lady friend
over there?

730
00:44:10,822 --> 00:44:12,289
Tanya is her name.

731
00:44:12,789 --> 00:44:14,692
And I have yet
to see her naked.

732
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:16,360
You want that?

733
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:20,231
Yeah, you want that.

734
00:44:23,768 --> 00:44:25,070
Tanya.

735
00:44:26,771 --> 00:44:27,702
Come here.

736
00:44:27,704 --> 00:44:30,074
[song continues]

737
00:44:35,847 --> 00:44:37,082
[inaudible]

738
00:44:44,222 --> 00:44:46,091
I wanna know more about
your friend here.

739
00:44:52,463 --> 00:44:53,498
Rob.

740
00:44:54,798 --> 00:44:55,699
Tanya.

741
00:44:57,135 --> 00:44:57,867
[Tanya]
How are you?

742
00:44:57,869 --> 00:45:00,172
[song ends]

743
00:45:01,672 --> 00:45:05,141
[Darcy] Oh, yeah, I think I saw...
[Baines] You did, huh?

744
00:45:05,143 --> 00:45:07,175
That's what comes with
running a ranch.

745
00:45:07,177 --> 00:45:08,579
- Okay.
- I guess.

746
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,182
- Hey, morning.
- [Baines] Morning.

747
00:45:13,184 --> 00:45:14,786
[Darcy] You like eggs?
Yeah, thank you.

748
00:45:15,353 --> 00:45:16,387
Good.

749
00:45:16,586 --> 00:45:17,621
Then sit.

750
00:45:18,356 --> 00:45:20,225
You remember
my daughter, Darcy?

751
00:45:20,557 --> 00:45:21,425
[Michael] I do.

752
00:45:22,626 --> 00:45:24,596
Did I not tell you
she was going to be here?

753
00:45:25,429 --> 00:45:26,762
You did not.

754
00:45:26,764 --> 00:45:29,668
That's because my father
always wanted a son.

755
00:45:30,268 --> 00:45:31,202
That's not true.

756
00:45:31,668 --> 00:45:32,871
I wanted two sons.
[chuckles]

757
00:45:34,539 --> 00:45:36,408
- Don't burn the eggs.
- [laughs]

758
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:42,279
It's not gonna pour itself.

759
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,048
Huh?

760
00:45:44,681 --> 00:45:46,682
You look like
you could use some.

761
00:45:46,684 --> 00:45:47,786
Oh. Thank you.

762
00:45:52,889 --> 00:45:56,293
[Baines] So, Vonetta Calhoun.

763
00:45:56,893 --> 00:45:58,961
- Senator from Virginia.
- Yeah.

764
00:45:58,963 --> 00:46:00,362
Did you see that clip?

765
00:46:00,364 --> 00:46:01,599
The racial profiling thing?

766
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:03,432
Yeah, I did.

767
00:46:03,434 --> 00:46:04,436
What'd you think?

768
00:46:05,436 --> 00:46:07,469
Honestly, I think
the racial profiling issue

769
00:46:07,471 --> 00:46:09,141
is a lot more complicated than
the people are willing to admit.

770
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:10,606
I know that.

771
00:46:10,608 --> 00:46:11,810
What do you think of her?

772
00:46:14,844 --> 00:46:17,313
The people
she's talking about

773
00:46:17,315 --> 00:46:19,583
are way more interested in assimilation
and survival than anything else.

774
00:46:21,619 --> 00:46:24,689
Like, you can't attract young voters
by attacking the way they dress.

775
00:46:32,396 --> 00:46:34,365
- So precious.
- Hi.

776
00:46:38,735 --> 00:46:40,638
[man] You only get
two tries for free.

777
00:46:42,706 --> 00:46:46,411
[Michael] <i>Gertie Hayden, the
cash cow, was old Texas oil.</i>

778
00:46:46,677 --> 00:46:49,181
<i>She had already bankrolled
one ex-president.</i>

779
00:46:54,318 --> 00:46:56,254
I don't trust a man
who don't drink.

780
00:46:59,789 --> 00:47:00,791
Yeah.

781
00:47:02,793 --> 00:47:03,762
Okay.

782
00:47:08,932 --> 00:47:10,766
You sure are
pretty to look at.

783
00:47:10,768 --> 00:47:12,603
- [chuckles]
- [laughs]

784
00:47:13,536 --> 00:47:16,674
- Now, that Reynolds boy, Ron Reynolds.
- Rob.

785
00:47:17,742 --> 00:47:19,911
Rob, Ron, whatever
the hell his name is.

786
00:47:20,978 --> 00:47:23,447
That boy gives me the heebie-jeebies,
you know what I mean?

787
00:47:24,282 --> 00:47:25,784
I believe in John.

788
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:28,687
He's a hell of a man and
that's why I'm gonna back him.

789
00:47:30,454 --> 00:47:33,988
Can't stand that wife,
though. [sighs]

790
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:35,893
Now, she is a terrific kid.

791
00:47:37,295 --> 00:47:40,331
When her mama died,
John didn't know what to do.

792
00:47:40,864 --> 00:47:42,563
That little girl,
as a seven-year-old,

793
00:47:42,565 --> 00:47:44,365
had more to do
with bringing John back

794
00:47:44,367 --> 00:47:46,237
than anything that
bitch has ever done.

795
00:47:47,304 --> 00:47:49,537
First thing Judith did
after they got married

796
00:47:49,539 --> 00:47:52,344
was to send Darcy away to a
private school in New England.

797
00:47:53,411 --> 00:47:55,547
[sighs]
Don't get me wrong,

798
00:47:55,846 --> 00:47:57,983
Judith has helped his
political career, all right.

799
00:47:58,516 --> 00:48:00,719
But with that little girl
away from him,

800
00:48:01,452 --> 00:48:03,588
that just about
broke John's heart.

801
00:48:04,422 --> 00:48:05,557
Is that right?

802
00:48:12,429 --> 00:48:15,963
I am so glad John decided
to unite us on this trip.

803
00:48:15,965 --> 00:48:17,534
[laughs]

804
00:48:17,867 --> 00:48:18,902
[Baines]
Come on.

805
00:48:24,708 --> 00:48:30,646
[Rob] And this is the answer to the
post-neocon Tea Party movements

806
00:48:30,648 --> 00:48:31,947
that have hijacked
the Republican...

807
00:48:31,949 --> 00:48:34,416
[Michael]
<i>Back in the capital,</i>

808
00:48:34,418 --> 00:48:36,552
<i>Tanya had agreed to have dinner with
Rob Reynolds as a favor to Mad Cash.</i>

809
00:48:36,554 --> 00:48:41,590
...family values, fiscal
responsibility, and my baby.

810
00:48:41,592 --> 00:48:44,059
I'm calling all the shots, and
once we get to the White House...

811
00:48:44,061 --> 00:48:46,298
Mad Cash said you know
people in television.

812
00:48:49,632 --> 00:48:50,668
Yeah.

813
00:48:51,969 --> 00:48:53,901
So, do you know anyone
at <i>Access Hollywood?</i>

814
00:48:53,903 --> 00:48:55,739
Because I think
I'd be good at that.

815
00:48:57,041 --> 00:48:58,943
This is the
District of Columbia.

816
00:49:00,744 --> 00:49:01,980
So you can't
help me with that?

817
00:49:03,447 --> 00:49:04,916
I know people
at Fox News.

818
00:49:07,083 --> 00:49:09,453
- Rob!
- Jerry.

819
00:49:10,855 --> 00:49:12,954
Jerry Todd,
Tanya Jones.

820
00:49:12,956 --> 00:49:14,326
Miss Jones.

821
00:49:14,557 --> 00:49:16,061
So, how goes
the campaign, Rob?

822
00:49:16,893 --> 00:49:18,529
- What campaign?
- Ha!

823
00:49:18,929 --> 00:49:21,733
Rob and I have the same job,
only I'm on a real team.

824
00:49:22,766 --> 00:49:25,836
Speaking of teams.
Isn't that Kenyon Carver?

825
00:49:26,036 --> 00:49:29,574
Also known to basketball fans as Mr.
Downtown?

826
00:49:30,708 --> 00:49:31,710
A pleasure.

827
00:49:34,545 --> 00:49:35,747
You don't like
your salad?

828
00:50:02,907 --> 00:50:03,875
Get in.

829
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:09,013
Umm, excuse me, I'm gonna
go to the ladies room.

830
00:50:22,793 --> 00:50:24,061
Look at Kenyon Carver there.

831
00:50:27,164 --> 00:50:28,967
He's the most selfish
player in the league.

832
00:50:31,936 --> 00:50:34,606
He wouldn't pass the salt to his
own mother at the dinner table.

833
00:50:36,907 --> 00:50:38,910
You know, I was
never good at math, Rob.

834
00:50:39,909 --> 00:50:42,679
But subtraction would indicate
you're minus one date.

835
00:51:19,983 --> 00:51:21,952
Did you sleep with
that old woman?

836
00:51:28,626 --> 00:51:29,594
No.

837
00:51:43,873 --> 00:51:45,108
[Darcy] This is
where it happened.

838
00:51:46,809 --> 00:51:48,012
And I was in the car
with her.

839
00:51:50,681 --> 00:51:52,550
She never saw
the other car coming.

840
00:52:01,157 --> 00:52:04,261
After the accident, when I finally
went back to school, um...

841
00:52:05,862 --> 00:52:08,799
the bus would drive
past here every day.

842
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:13,070
And, um... then one
day I just, I...

843
00:52:13,704 --> 00:52:15,240
I broke.
I broke down.

844
00:52:17,675 --> 00:52:18,877
I told my father.

845
00:52:21,911 --> 00:52:24,214
You know, he didn't want
me to see that, so...

846
00:52:26,951 --> 00:52:30,121
he used his influence
to have the bus rerouted.

847
00:52:33,724 --> 00:52:35,760
Took 20 minutes longer
to get to school, but...

848
00:52:38,929 --> 00:52:40,865
I never had to go
by here again.

849
00:52:51,875 --> 00:52:53,177
You have to promise...

850
00:52:54,811 --> 00:52:56,246
to never hurt my father.

851
00:52:58,715 --> 00:52:59,650
Huh?

852
00:53:02,987 --> 00:53:04,055
Promise.

853
00:53:06,724 --> 00:53:07,859
I promise.

854
00:53:23,974 --> 00:53:27,045
[grunting, moaning]

855
00:53:31,114 --> 00:53:32,317
This is crazy.

856
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:35,053
- Yeah, it is.
- [sighs]

857
00:53:36,085 --> 00:53:37,187
Last time.

858
00:53:40,324 --> 00:53:42,193
Good, yeah, I think
that's for the best.

859
00:53:45,795 --> 00:53:47,164
Last time here, Michael.

860
00:53:54,204 --> 00:53:55,840
I don't think I can
do this anymore.

861
00:53:56,907 --> 00:53:58,076
It's wrong.

862
00:54:01,811 --> 00:54:03,847
You'll do this
until I say stop.

863
00:54:06,215 --> 00:54:09,152
Find us a new place.
Not a hotel.

864
00:54:14,291 --> 00:54:16,628
Next time you tell me
this is wrong...

865
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,063
I'll tell Rob Reynolds
that you raped me.

866
00:54:22,699 --> 00:54:24,402
I'm wearing your
DNA right now.

867
00:54:26,269 --> 00:54:27,771
Don't forget that.

868
00:54:31,942 --> 00:54:33,644
Just find a new place.

869
00:54:44,054 --> 00:54:46,354
[scoffs] I just wish
more people knew

870
00:54:46,356 --> 00:54:48,359
how easy it was
to get this video.

871
00:54:53,831 --> 00:54:54,766
You proud of me?

872
00:54:55,164 --> 00:54:57,235
Yeah, I guess.
Jesus, poor dog.

873
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:03,941
There's more.

874
00:55:04,173 --> 00:55:05,342
What's this?

875
00:55:05,876 --> 00:55:07,208
Peanut butter and roses.

876
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:09,146
- No, I...
- [laughs] Here.

877
00:55:11,114 --> 00:55:13,815
"You are a true artist
and a great American. RR."

878
00:55:13,817 --> 00:55:15,016
Rob Reynolds, what a guy.

879
00:55:15,018 --> 00:55:16,054
[keys jingle]

880
00:55:16,887 --> 00:55:18,356
Ain't life grand?

881
00:55:23,893 --> 00:55:25,462
Cal, are you sure this is
what you wanna be doing?

882
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:27,265
Absolutely.

883
00:55:29,099 --> 00:55:30,334
I found my calling.

884
00:55:53,990 --> 00:55:56,193
Michael, Rob wants to
see you in his office.

885
00:56:06,503 --> 00:56:07,536
You wanted to see me?

886
00:56:07,538 --> 00:56:09,072
Michael, come on in.

887
00:56:09,338 --> 00:56:10,306
Oh, John.

888
00:56:10,974 --> 00:56:13,141
Tell Rob what you told me
about racial profiling.

889
00:56:13,143 --> 00:56:14,508
Yes, the senator says

890
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:16,978
that you have an opinion
about Vonetta Calhoun

891
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:18,182
that you'd like to share.

892
00:56:19,916 --> 00:56:21,351
We're anxious to hear what.

893
00:56:23,019 --> 00:56:27,358
Uh, yeah, um, I think I said
that the issue is complex.

894
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:30,090
I also said the people
she's talking about

895
00:56:30,092 --> 00:56:32,864
are more worried about assimilation
and survival than anything else.

896
00:56:35,965 --> 00:56:37,501
Is that it?
Did I leave anything out?

897
00:56:37,967 --> 00:56:40,203
Ah, about
the young voters...

898
00:56:40,403 --> 00:56:42,336
Uh, you can't
attract...

899
00:56:42,338 --> 00:56:45,809
You can't attract young voters
by attacking the way they dress.

900
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:48,913
Thanks, Michael.

901
00:56:54,885 --> 00:56:57,985
Well, I think
Michael's right,

902
00:56:57,987 --> 00:57:00,524
Vonetta Calhoun is definitely
not the way to go.

903
00:57:01,291 --> 00:57:04,458
She's out of the event,
your rap star buddy is in.

904
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:05,896
Very good, Senator.

905
00:57:07,063 --> 00:57:08,266
Rob, call me John.

906
00:57:18,442 --> 00:57:21,846
So? How's Cruella de Vil
been treating you?

907
00:57:22,445 --> 00:57:24,347
Uh, with kid gloves.

908
00:57:24,614 --> 00:57:26,183
'Cause she's
afraid of you.

909
00:57:26,583 --> 00:57:28,485
I don't... I don't want
to talk about her.

910
00:57:31,121 --> 00:57:33,090
Guess who just walked in.

911
00:57:35,525 --> 00:57:37,427
What's up, man?
Man.

912
00:57:39,128 --> 00:57:41,865
[sighs] So, what's the good word?
Abstinence.

913
00:57:42,199 --> 00:57:44,231
That's a good word
for people who get laid.

914
00:57:44,233 --> 00:57:46,901
Sadly, for the rest of us,
it's merely a fact of life.

915
00:57:46,903 --> 00:57:48,503
What can
I get you?

916
00:57:48,505 --> 00:57:51,373
Club soda with, actually, just
a little bit of rum in it.

917
00:57:51,375 --> 00:57:53,878
- Okay. Menu?
- No, no, thanks.

918
00:57:54,478 --> 00:57:55,943
So, how's Callie doing?

919
00:57:55,945 --> 00:57:58,382
Don't know.
Fine, I guess. Why?

920
00:57:59,048 --> 00:58:02,018
Tell me, was that a
Doberman or a Rottweiler?

921
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:05,088
Don't ever play poker.

922
00:58:05,422 --> 00:58:07,458
So, who's she working for,
Jerry Todd?

923
00:58:08,492 --> 00:58:10,294
No, not quite.

924
00:58:10,693 --> 00:58:11,929
Indeed.

925
00:58:12,929 --> 00:58:15,232
The plot thickens.
Okay.

926
00:58:15,965 --> 00:58:18,335
Thank you. I'm gonna have to
order off the menu for this one.

927
00:58:18,936 --> 00:58:20,638
God, I love
dinner theater.

928
00:58:23,606 --> 00:58:24,909
Oh, shit.

929
00:58:25,641 --> 00:58:26,877
It's Darcy.

930
00:58:29,445 --> 00:58:31,114
That's Baines's daughter?

931
00:58:34,451 --> 00:58:35,619
My God.

932
00:58:36,652 --> 00:58:38,421
She's breathtaking.

933
00:58:38,621 --> 00:58:41,389
I mean, not in the "I wanna
fucking bang her" kinda way,

934
00:58:41,391 --> 00:58:47,063
more in the "I wanna hold her and
spoon with her after the fact" way.

935
00:58:49,266 --> 00:58:50,965
Maybe even weep a little.

936
00:58:50,967 --> 00:58:52,032
Hey, man, you mind if a take
rain check on this one?

937
00:58:52,034 --> 00:58:54,168
What...
Dude. What...

938
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:55,336
- Come on, you just got here.
- I'll see you at the fountain later.

939
00:58:55,338 --> 00:58:56,507
You gotta be kidding me.

940
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:01,078
Hey.

941
00:59:03,579 --> 00:59:04,547
Give me a ride?

942
00:59:23,132 --> 00:59:24,134
That girl you were with...

943
00:59:25,668 --> 00:59:27,003
she was at your party.

944
00:59:29,572 --> 00:59:31,074
She the one who
told you about me?

945
00:59:35,612 --> 00:59:37,148
Jeannie's an idiot.

946
00:59:38,382 --> 00:59:39,650
What'd she...
What'd she say?

947
00:59:46,222 --> 00:59:47,123
What are you doing?

948
00:59:55,065 --> 00:59:56,666
I can't...
I'm... I can't.

Callie?
[cell phone ringing]

956
01:02:38,762 --> 01:02:40,561
Hey, Callie,
I'm glad you called.

957
01:02:40,563 --> 01:02:42,532
I'm wondering, can you be out
of the apartment tomorrow...

958
01:02:45,969 --> 01:02:46,903
What?

959
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,443
[crowd chattering]

960
01:02:56,313 --> 01:02:58,548
I'm so sorry, you're gonna
be okay, don't worry.

961
01:03:02,652 --> 01:03:05,489
Callie?
Callie, what happened?

962
01:03:07,824 --> 01:03:10,927
[crowd chattering]
[hip-hop on speakers]

963
01:03:31,447 --> 01:03:32,650
Can I help you?

964
01:03:33,483 --> 01:03:35,686
[people screaming]

965
01:03:36,286 --> 01:03:37,851
I'm gonna fucking kill
him, you understand me?

966
01:03:37,853 --> 01:03:38,853
He's dead!

967
01:03:38,855 --> 01:03:40,320
What are you talking about?

968
01:03:40,322 --> 01:03:41,588
Why don't you go
fucking ask Rob?

969
01:03:41,590 --> 01:03:43,423
Rob? Okay, wait,
I'm coming with you.

970
01:03:43,425 --> 01:03:44,460
No.

971
01:03:45,728 --> 01:03:47,561
- Don't.
- Callie.

972
01:03:47,563 --> 01:03:48,865
Get the fuck
away from me!

973

[ambulance departs]
[siren wailing]

[Michael] <i>Rob Reynolds
had been humiliated.</i>

he did for personal reasons...</i>

all the more unsettling.</i>

- [woman] Stop it! Stop it!
- <i>Help! Somebody, help!</i>

979
01:04:09,552 --> 01:04:11,351
[Callie]
They posted it online?

980
01:04:11,353 --> 01:04:13,354
It's not good enough that they
beat her to a bloody pulp,

981
01:04:13,356 --> 01:04:15,356
they had to post it
online too?

982
01:04:15,358 --> 01:04:16,824
There's no way in hell I'm
letting him get away with it.

983
01:04:16,826 --> 01:04:18,992
I'm taking Tanya,
I'm gonna take her home.

984
01:04:18,994 --> 01:04:22,463
And then as soon as I get back here,
oh-ho-ho, I'm gonna fix this.

985
01:04:22,465 --> 01:04:25,432
And then we're getting out of
here for good, so pack your shit!

986
01:04:25,434 --> 01:04:28,903
What... We? What are you talk... Callie!
What are you talking about?

987
01:04:28,905 --> 01:04:29,873
Callie!

988
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:32,842

Damn it. Cocksucker.

Who the fuck is
knocking on my door?

[knocking continues]

993
01:04:49,626 --> 01:04:51,428
Oh. Hello, Mother.

994
01:04:52,762 --> 01:04:54,565
I'm sorry, I think I have
the wrong apartment.

995
01:04:54,764 --> 01:04:58,568
Are you sure? Because I'm not
the only one that lives here.

996
01:04:59,369 --> 01:05:00,967
Yeah, I'm sure it's
the wrong apartment.

997
01:05:00,969 --> 01:05:03,573
Hey, you look familiar.

998
01:05:04,673 --> 01:05:05,942
Are you a friend
of Michael's?

999
01:05:06,876 --> 01:05:08,842
No, just a little lost.

1000
01:05:08,844 --> 01:05:11,014
- Maybe I could help.
- No, thank you.

Okay, well, you have

Michael Lawson.

1003
01:05:26,695 --> 01:05:27,961
Is in big trouble.

1004
01:05:27,963 --> 01:05:29,967
<i>Hey.</i>
Where were you?

1005
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:33,637
I'm sorry. Reynolds called me into
his office, I lost track of time.

1006
01:05:33,936 --> 01:05:36,639
Who was that annoying girl
that answered your door?

1007
01:05:37,773 --> 01:05:39,374
[softly] Fuck.

1008
01:05:39,376 --> 01:05:41,075
[normal voice]
Uh, that was my roommate.

<i>She was not supposed
to be there.</i>

1010
01:05:42,811 --> 01:05:43,878
Is she your lover?

1011
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:44,979
No, she's a lesbian.

1012
01:05:44,981 --> 01:05:46,016
Get rid of her.

1013
01:05:46,548 --> 01:05:47,715
Well, I thought I had.

1014
01:05:47,717 --> 01:05:49,320
Just make it happen.

1015
01:05:54,623 --> 01:05:55,892
[cell phone ringing]

1016
01:05:59,094 --> 01:05:59,996
Yeah?

1017
01:06:00,630 --> 01:06:02,465
It's me.
<i>Yeah.</i>

1018
01:06:02,965 --> 01:06:04,500
Well, you were
supposed to clear out.

1019
01:06:04,768 --> 01:06:05,635
Why?

1020
01:06:06,536 --> 01:06:07,671
I think you know why.

1021
01:06:08,103 --> 01:06:10,406
Chanel No. 5?
We met.

1022
01:06:11,173 --> 01:06:12,509
Leave it alone, Cal.

1023
01:06:14,744 --> 01:06:15,813
Look...

1024
01:06:16,012 --> 01:06:17,711
I just have to
drive Tanya home,

1025
01:06:17,713 --> 01:06:20,049
and then you can have the
place all to yourself.

1026
01:06:21,184 --> 01:06:22,419
How is Tanya?

1027
01:06:23,385 --> 01:06:25,855
That should have been
your first concern.

[dial tone]

1029

[Todd] This better be good. I was in
the middle of an amazing massage.

1030
01:07:16,172 --> 01:07:18,104
Well...

1031
01:07:18,106 --> 01:07:19,240
I've got something I'm selling
to the highest bidder,

1032

if you know
what I mean.

1033
01:07:20,610 --> 01:07:22,146
Okay, so what
do you got?

1034
01:07:22,744 --> 01:07:24,177
It will destroy
Rob Reynolds

1035
01:07:24,179 --> 01:07:25,915
and the entire
Baines campaign.

1036
01:07:27,983 --> 01:07:29,420
I might have
an investor.

1037
01:07:30,686 --> 01:07:32,489
You tell me what you have,
I'll tell you what it's worth.

1038
01:07:34,824 --> 01:07:35,992
So, what do you got?

1039

[Darcy] Take me away from here.
[Michael] Huh?

1042
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:53,109
Take me to your place.

1043
01:07:55,077 --> 01:07:56,480
I can't,
I have a roommate.

1044
01:07:58,014 --> 01:07:59,650
Then take me to a hotel.

1045
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:01,816
[Michael sighs]

1046
01:08:01,818 --> 01:08:03,120
That's not...

1047
01:08:03,719 --> 01:08:06,521
We can't start sneaking
around like that, Darcy.

1048
01:08:06,523 --> 01:08:07,858
That's just
not a good idea.

1049

[song continues]
[man singing]

1050
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:19,102
I should go,

My father is going to make

01:08:36,752 --> 01:08:37,820
I know.

1054
01:08:42,091 --> 01:08:43,527
I want you to take me.

1055
01:08:48,698 --> 01:08:50,834
I don't think the
campaign wants that.

1056
01:08:59,676 --> 01:09:00,878
It's what I want.

1057
01:09:03,579 --> 01:09:04,814
[sighs] Darcy.

1058
01:09:21,029 --> 01:09:22,131
I love you.

I'm not happy.
Jesus Christ!

1070
01:10:21,056 --> 01:10:23,424
What exactly do you think you're doing?
Judith...

1071
01:10:23,426 --> 01:10:25,228
I want this to stop.

1072
01:10:26,328 --> 01:10:27,396
I... I don't know
what you mean.

1073
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:30,665
You don't know what you're
dealing with, Michael.

1074
01:10:30,667 --> 01:10:32,035
This is not about us.

1075
01:10:33,336 --> 01:10:36,640
This is about Darcy, and she
is an extremely troubled girl.

1076
01:10:37,372 --> 01:10:38,774
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1077

Look...

1078
01:10:42,445 --> 01:10:43,943
You have a future
if you want it,

1079
01:10:43,945 --> 01:10:45,948
you can go on the road
and campaign with John.

1080
01:10:46,282 --> 01:10:48,085
And I promise to
leave you alone.

1081
01:10:48,685 --> 01:10:50,718
But this country
needs my husband,

1082
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:54,625
and the only thing Darcy will bring
you or this campaign is down.

1083
01:11:01,797 --> 01:11:03,032
What do you mean,
she's troubled?

1084
01:11:07,069 --> 01:11:09,372
She tried to kill me,
that's why she was sent away.

1085
01:11:12,074 --> 01:11:13,376
She tried to kill you.

1086
01:11:15,712 --> 01:11:17,180
- You're fucking lying.
- Look at me.

1087
01:11:21,216 --> 01:11:24,018
When she as 14, she attacked
me at the dinner table.

1088
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:25,385
Attacked you?
Stabbed me in the hand,

1089
01:11:25,387 --> 01:11:27,356
could've cut me to ribbons
if John hadn't...

1090
01:11:28,390 --> 01:11:31,027
Well, look, something
you may not have noticed.

1091
01:11:37,734 --> 01:11:38,669
Shit.

[lighter clinks]

1093
01:11:46,475 --> 01:11:48,045
Now, why...
why would she do that?

1094
01:11:48,243 --> 01:11:49,311
I'm not getting into it.

1095
01:11:53,048 --> 01:11:54,184
Why should I
believe you, then?

1096
01:11:59,122 --> 01:12:00,257
I'm through with you.

1097
01:12:01,056 --> 01:12:02,091
With this.

1098
01:12:05,261 --> 01:12:07,297
We won't be seeing each
other anymore, okay?

1099
01:12:10,198 --> 01:12:12,735
And I'm...
I'm sorry I snapped and...

1100
01:12:13,536 --> 01:12:14,837
threatened you, but...

1101
01:12:20,275 --> 01:12:22,045
I felt something
for you and...

1102
01:12:25,081 --> 01:12:26,349
you made me feel ugly.

1103
01:12:30,552 --> 01:12:32,088
Anyway, it's done, and...

1104
01:12:33,122 --> 01:12:36,426
you see the scar and you
know I'm telling the truth.

1105
01:12:44,833 --> 01:12:46,235
You want to run
for Congress, right?

1106
01:12:47,936 --> 01:12:49,038
Am I right?

1107
01:12:53,009 --> 01:12:54,444
We can make that happen.

1108
01:12:56,378 --> 01:12:59,349
But are you willing to make the
necessary sacrifices, Michael?

1109
01:13:03,519 --> 01:13:04,755
Think about it.

1110
01:13:12,929 --> 01:13:13,930
What's up?

1111
01:13:14,963 --> 01:13:16,964
- Billy, come in.
- What's up?

1112
01:13:16,966 --> 01:13:18,365
Come on. Have a seat.

1113
01:13:18,367 --> 01:13:20,302
[indistinct] No, no, it's okay.
Sit down.

We... have a snitch
at Jerry Todd's office.

Said someone came to see him,
said she has something...

1116
01:13:29,212 --> 01:13:31,111
that can destroy Baines.

1117
01:13:31,113 --> 01:13:32,513
She?
Who are we talking about?

1118
01:13:32,515 --> 01:13:34,281
Billy,

1119
01:13:34,283 --> 01:13:37,053
there are 270 million guns
in the United States of America.

1120
01:13:40,189 --> 01:13:41,423
And that's one of them.

1121
01:13:44,292 --> 01:13:45,394
Callie?

1122

Michael,
where are you?

1161
01:16:09,171 --> 01:16:11,541
Rob, I'm sorry.
I'm handling this.

Handling what?

1163
01:16:14,275 --> 01:16:16,680
- I'm not stupid.
- No, I am.

What do you want?
I'm willing to pay.

This was not me, I had nothing
to do with this, Rob.

01:16:21,449 --> 01:16:24,987
Really? 'Cause from what I'm
hearing, you play a major role.

01:16:25,186 --> 01:16:27,090
I'm taking care of this,
I promise.

What the fuck are you doing?

give me the camera, you need to erase...

- Why?

Michael, who is this?

This is Callie.

[Callie] I need to leave.

I don't need to tell you
that we live in trying times.

Challenges facing

rising unemployment,
runaway inflation,

We share the same
core values.

We can embrace

really matter now, does it?

1262
01:23:11,193 --> 01:23:13,829
Where is he? I was hoping
you could tell me.

1263

[cell phone rings]
Yeah?

1264

1268
01:24:36,545 --> 01:24:37,947
Oh, there he is.
Come here.

01:24:38,180 --> 01:24:39,182
Rob. Rob. The fuck you
think you're doin', huh?

1270
01:24:39,581 --> 01:24:41,214
Fuck is wrong
with you, huh?

1271
01:24:41,216 --> 01:24:42,214
Calm down, Rob. You wanna
fucking ruin everything?

1272
01:24:42,216 --> 01:24:43,752
You and that dyke cunt.

What?

1275
01:24:55,831 --> 01:24:57,033
We need to talk.

1276
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,002
Where's Michael?

1277
01:25:04,273 --> 01:25:05,807
Michael's on the TV.

1278
01:25:08,944 --> 01:25:09,846

No, no, no.

Okay, you need
to calm down.

It's okay,
just please calm down.

No, Darcy.

Darcy!

1285
01:25:28,963 --> 01:25:30,263
I'm gonna take care of this.
You don't think I'll crush you?

[Darcy] Michael!
[Rob] What happened?

[Darcy] I'm sorry.

- [Rob] No, no.

1303
01:26:16,845 --> 01:26:18,812
Darcy, give me the knife.

1304
01:26:18,814 --> 01:26:20,550
No! We have to take him to the hospital.
Give me the knife!

[Darcy] Michael!

Darcy, listen to me, Darcy!

Listen to me, you're gonna have to
listen to me, okay, both of you.

1308
01:26:28,122 --> 01:26:29,692
Darcy, listen to him.

1309
01:26:56,652 --> 01:26:57,819
Open it.

They're gonna get you an ambulance
and you're gonna be okay.

1313
01:27:10,032 --> 01:27:11,363
You're gonna be okay,
I promise!

1314

You're gonna be all right.

1315
01:27:13,702 --> 01:27:17,106
Michael, okay, you're gonna
be all right, I promise.

1316
01:27:17,305 --> 01:27:19,205
Put him in the car.
[Michael groaning]

1317
01:27:19,207 --> 01:27:21,307
No, no, he needs
an ambulance.

1318
01:27:21,309 --> 01:27:23,677
Darcy, you have
to trust Rob.

1319
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:26,012
You're gonna have
to trust Rob.

He's probably still in the parking

1325
01:28:03,217 --> 01:28:04,185

Were gonna drop him
on the side of the road.

1332
01:28:31,412 --> 01:28:32,847
Wait, what?

1333
01:28:34,082 --> 01:28:35,851
Call 911 with your dummy phone
and they'll come get him.

1334
01:28:36,083 --> 01:28:38,250
They'll take you to the
hospital, fix you up.

1335
01:28:38,252 --> 01:28:39,518
Can you hold on
for that long?

I don't know,
I don't know.

And when the cops come,
you tell them

the person who stabbed
you was male Caucasian.

1339
01:28:48,395 --> 01:28:50,432
- Darcy?
- You understand, Michael?

1340
01:28:53,301 --> 01:28:54,403
Yes.

1341
01:28:55,871 --> 01:28:57,707
[Rob] Get his watch and
his wallet, everything.

1342
01:29:06,347 --> 01:29:08,751
I should have gone with
him to the hospital.

1343
01:29:09,384 --> 01:29:10,920
Rob will take care of it.

1344
01:29:13,921 --> 01:29:16,255
It was an accident,
I wasn't trying...

1345
01:29:16,257 --> 01:29:17,859
Are you gonna help me?

1346
01:29:18,359 --> 01:29:19,961
Are you gonna
help your father?

1347
01:29:21,229 --> 01:29:23,065
Is he gonna send
me away again?

1348
01:29:25,567 --> 01:29:26,868
Look at me.

Look at me.

No one is getting sent
away, do you understand?

1351
01:29:38,412 --> 01:29:40,214
No one is getting
sent away.

We are gonna be
the First fucking Family.

Now, go get a mop.

[Rob] We play this right...

You listening, Michael?

1356
01:30:11,279 --> 01:30:13,482
