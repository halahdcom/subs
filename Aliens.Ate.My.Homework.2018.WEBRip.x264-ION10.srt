1
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:26,711
Ready?

2
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,381
- Now!

3
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,384
- Ew!
- It's a perfect likeness.

4
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,931
Her name's hard to pronounce.

5
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:42,852
You see, on her planet,
their vocal cords are in the tentacles,

6
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,230
but it sounds a little like...

7
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,987
Art, we're getting them
all worked up before bed.

8
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,573
- It really is time to sleep.
- There's no time to sleep.

9
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:58,118
It's very important
that we make this movie.

10
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,997
Because the world needs to know

11
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:07,877
that aliens walk among us,
and they look like...

12
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:16,344
Gotcha! Look, Mom's right, all right?
Enough movie magic for tonight.

13
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:17,427
Come on.

14
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,388
Come here, bud.

15
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:21,474
Time for all our little aliens
to get into their space pajamas,

16
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,059
and brush their teeth...

17
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:28,189
With some Venusian tooth goop!

18
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:31,609
- Yay! Goop!
- Yeah!

19
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:34,612
- All right.
- All right.

20
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,239
Night, buds. Come on.

21
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,074
All right, night, sweetheart.
Love you.

22
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,159
Love you.

23
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,911
Okay, let's go.

24
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,414
- We're gonna be first. Come on, let's go.

25
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,583
Hey, Dad.

26
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,129
She looks so real.

27
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,089
Well, why not?

28
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:56,134
Astronomers think there could be
billions more planets like Earth

29
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,510
in our galaxy alone.

30
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,929
They can't all just be
empty balls of rock.

31
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,600
What was that?

32
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,613
I just remembered something only I can do.

33
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,784
- Everything's gonna be all right.

34
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:22,868
Ow!

35
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,791
I'll come back, Rod. I promise.

36
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,712
Dad? Dad!

37
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:46,559
Dad!

38
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,479
Dad!

39
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:18,318
Hey, he's coming! Rod! Rod!
Rod, Rod, come on, turn around! Rod! Rod!

40
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,611
- Billy.

41
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,364
- Hello, Pudge-Boy...

42
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:25,783
- No, no!

43
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,661
Fabulous.

44
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,497
Oh!

45
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,965
Twenty-three. Yeah.

46
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,135
Sorry. Wipe?

47
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,307
Of all the kids in sixth grade,
why does Billy Becker got to pick on me?

48
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,433
You know how it is.

49
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,102
Some people collect stamps,
or comic books...

50
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:54,896
It's his hobby?

51
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,523
He's the official class bully.

52
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,734
You need to stay out of sight
till he forgets you.

53
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,195
But then he'll just bug some other kid.

54
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,810
There's got to be a better way.

55
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,991
Yeah. Well, how about this?
School's almost over.

56
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:10,244
Couple more days, no more homework,
and no more Billy Becker.

57
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,998
Just two whole weeks of fun
and excitement, and...

58
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,249
And fun and excitement.

59
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,586
Like anything fun or exciting
ever happens around here.

60
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,353
What's up with the freaky snow?
I know.

61
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,438
It's like the school's
a giant snow magnet,

62
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:38,916
pulling it in from everywhere else.

63
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,940
That sucks.

64
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,985
We need it to snow everywhere,
so we can finally get a snow day.

65
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,696
No, snow week! Snow year!

66
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,532
Yeah!

67
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:50,326
- Well, see you tomorrow, Rod.
- Okay. See you, Mickey.

68
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,453
See ya!

69
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:55,414
<i>In local weather,
an extremely localized snowfall...</i>

70
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,376
Eh...

71
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,219
- Eh...

72
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,354
What are you doing here?

73
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,730
- Rod!

74
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,899
My office. Now.

75
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:31,367
Rod, your Aunt Grace and Uncle Roger
are just having a few problems,

76
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,910
and they need to get away.

77
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,788
If Elspeth was my kid,
I'd need to get away, too.

78
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,832
Rod! How long will she be here?

79
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:42,295
Your cousin will be staying with us
for winter break.

80
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:43,795
Great.

81
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:46,382
Her parents are having problems,
so my break's ruined?

82
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,759
Oh, Roddie, not everything is about you.

83
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:50,983
Look, I need to work.
Get out of my chair.

84
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,820
Go do your homework, or something, okay?

85
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:08,196
- Eat a bug.

86
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,530
You did that on purpose.

87
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,616
Rod, Elspeth and I
are going to the mall.

88
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,242
You're in charge until I get back.

89
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:16,787
Mom, no. I have to finish
my science fair project.

90
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:20,458
Well, you've got
two eager helpers upstairs. Bye.

91
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,304
Cold, but I like it.

92
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,100
Don't tell Rod.

93
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,317
It's almost done. Just hold still.

94
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,570
I really want you
to play with us, Rod. Please?

95
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,322
It's gonna look awesome.

96
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,126
Huh?

97
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,935
Again! Again! Again! Again!

98
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:03,769
One more move, Earthling,
and I ventilate your skull!

99
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,068
So, after they got
the rabbit out of the tree,

100
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,630
they said I didn't have to look after
the classroom pet anymore,

101
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:16,494
which is too bad because I really thought
that parachute was gonna work.

102
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,785
Because it did with the turtle.
Well, two times out of the three.

103
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,037
Who are you?

104
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:27,251
Captain Grakker of the Galactic Patrol,
commander of this mission.

105
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,546
- Oh.

106
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:36,010
Saving this miserable backward world
from total planetary disaster!

107
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:40,931
But first, I have to deal
with an unexpected setback.

108
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,685
Wait. Go back to the part
about total planetary disaster.

109
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,854
Your assistance is required.

110
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,065
Therefore, in accordance with.

111
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:53,527
Provision 13.4.7.6
of the Galactic Legal Code,

112
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,947
you are now my deputy.

113
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,450
Request denied!

114
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,370
He's mean, Roddie. Make him go away.

115
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,288
Silence, grubling!

116
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,833
- He's funny! I wanna play with him.
- Back!

117
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,794
- Linda, don't!
- Back, larva! Back!

118
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,757
You're a bad toy! Bad!

119
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,843
Nobody ray-guns my little sister!

120
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:22,139
Oh, yeah?
Well, to that, I say, boogers!

121
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:23,682
What?

122
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:24,809
Captain Grakker!

123
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,644
Desist at once!

124
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:32,191
You really should have let me exit first.

125
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,192
But...

126
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:36,320
Running off
without the proper behavior module...

127
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,739
- Let me change it for you.

128
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:04,473
Oh. Well, hello there, young Earthlings.

129
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:08,811
Pretty swell planet you got here.

130
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:09,937
Yup.

131
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,440
Allow me to introduce myself,

132
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:15,693
- as I should have done in the first place.
- Oh.

133
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,778
I am Madame Pong,

134
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:22,241
Diplomatic Officer of the <i>Starship Ferkel.</i>

135
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:26,454
Starship. Cool.

136
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,666
I don't know how,
and they couldn't let go of their ladder.

137
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,461
So, I thought they were gonna be
stuck up there for good,

138
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,463
and I was gonna be on that roof forever.

139
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,050
You know, I think Rod had a bad day
at school today.

140
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:43,137
It's okay, Aunt Gwen. I understand.

141
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,891
After all, he's only 12.

142
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,601
So are you, my dear.

143
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,022
I think I got it.

144
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,942
First, you don't want me
to take you to my leader.

145
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,110
Gracious, no!

146
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,696
It's essential you keep the secret
of our existence

147
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,239
from your world's primiti.

148
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,577
I mean, emerging civilization.

149
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,038
If you do spill our beans,

150
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,415
I am authorized to fry your brains

151
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,584
- and the brains of anyone else you tell.
- What?

152
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,049
So, the policewomen
were very understanding,

153
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,342
but the firefighters weren't,

154
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:24,678
because the Krazy Glue I used
to attach my suction cups

155
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:25,930
somehow got everywhere.

156
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,273
But it's okay I know about you

157
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,526
because you need my help to hide your ship

158
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,819
until you fix the whatcha-ma-thingy

159
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,239
that will change it back
to its usual size.

160
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,699
"Embiggen it," as you Earthlings say.

161
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,034
Hmm.

162
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,494
No, we don't.

163
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,271
<i>What happened to the third turtle?</i>

164
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,557
- Yeah, you don't want to know.
- No, I don't want to know.

165
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:53,707
They're home!

166
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:58,170
Listen, I'll help you hide your ship,
but first, you've gotta help me, fast!

167
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,923
- Hello! We're back!

168
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,553
What kind of science project
is Rod building up there?

169
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,179
It shouldn't sound like that.

170
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,978
I almost won my school's
science fair project this year, Aunt Gwen.

171
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,061
Almost?

172
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,189
I made a really sharp set
of parabolic wings.

173
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,324
Apparently, being pulled
behind a moving car while on a skateboard

174
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,701
is too dangerous, or something.

175
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,287
Knock, knock.

176
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,456
What was all that thumping and bumping?

177
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,583
Just cleaning up.

178
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,420
Well, I can see that.
How unusual.

179
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,547
The little aliens helped us!

180
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,173
'Cause we're helping them!

181
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,258
Well, that's nice of you.

182
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,552
We had to 'cause they have ray-guns.

183
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:49,638
And they'll fry our brains! Pew, pew!

184
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,810
Ah!

185
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,688
Clever cleaning game, big brother.

186
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,607
Is it okay if I go to Seldom Seen?

187
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,443
Sure, just be back
in time for dinner, okay?

188
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:07,114
Eric, Linda, why don't we all
get cleaned up before dinner, hmm?

189
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,700
Elspeth, why don't you go out with Rod?

190
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,702
I'd rather help you, Aunt Gwen.

191
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,580
Thanks, Mom! Won't be late!

192
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:18,542
Okay. Hey, you two,
don't touch the walls with that stuff!

193
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,425
What?

194
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,474
You're hiding something.
I'll find it.

195
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:59,705
My grandpa built our house on what used to be a part of his farm.
There are lots of woods, even a swamp if you go far enough.

196
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,211
And when you go even further,

197
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:05,089
you finally come up
on this wide-open field

198
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,174
that my grandpa calls "Seldom Seen."

199
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:12,388
Grandpa calls it that because no one
ever comes here, except my family.

200
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,101
Whoa!

201
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:20,896
Probably because we're the only ones
who don't believe

202
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,357
all the stories
about all the strange stuff

203
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,668
that's supposed to happen here,

204
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,902
like strange lights, or blizzards in July.

205
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,404
I've been coming here all my life,

206
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,322
and I've never seen
anything strange happen,

207
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,366
until now.

208
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,703
Time to change your settings, Captain.
We have work to do.

209
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,287
- Ahh.

210
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,003
Will that be enough room?

211
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:47,840
For the <i>Ferkel,</i> yes,
but we must move back a safe distance.

212
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,222
Activate the embiggener.

213
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,225
- That's classified.

214
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,243
Boogers, boogers!
Boogers-boogers-boogers!

215
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,995
What is it with you and "boogers"?

216
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,598
Is that not an appropriate expression

217
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:23,792
of righteous warrior rage
and frustration on your world?

218
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,128
Maybe, if you're five.

219
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,588
How about fart burps?

220
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,382
Where exactly did you learn our language?

221
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,639
Boogers.

222
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,976
<i>Local weather
is very much in the news today,</i>

223
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,495
<i>as another occurrence
of a site-specific snow storm...</i>

224
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,562
here we go.

225
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,022
All set.

226
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:50,611
<i>Say they have to go back
almost 15 years to find records...</i>

227
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:53,113
My mom says
Uncle Art was rotten to run away

228
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,323
and leave you like he did.

229
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,328
He wouldn't have left unless he had to.

230
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,790
He told Rod he'd be back,
and your Uncle Art,

231
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,167
he never lies.

232
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,170
Grown-ups have a lot of secrets.

233
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:13,175
My mom and dad, they think
I don't know what's going on, but I do.

234
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,305
Listen, dinner's on the table
in 15 minutes, okay?

235
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:19,428
Why don't you go tell Rod?

236
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,566
<i>I can't hide you guys forever.</i>

237
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,527
How long will it take you
to repair your ship?

238
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,114
Let me guess, it's classified.

239
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,158
- What you said.

240
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,327
- No, don't!

241
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,372
Oh. Sorry. What's this stuff?

242
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,792
I was making a movie with my dad.

243
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,794
Sci-fi, obviously.

244
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,172
My dad said it was more
like a documentary.

245
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,758
Do you like <i>Star Wars?</i>

246
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,222
<i>Star Trek.</i>

247
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,143
We need to talk.

248
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,148
- No.

249
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,194
That's not how you spell "Vesuvius."

250
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,320
That's how I spell it.

251
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,869
Your mom says dinner's almost ready.
Don't be late.

252
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,579
Okay. You can go, now.

253
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:29,710
I'll let her know
you're busy playing with your dolls.

254
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,086
They're action figures.

255
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,589
Whatever you need
to tell yourself, Roddie.

256
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,886
Hey! New rules.

257
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,680
No ray-gunning at anybody,
not even Elspeth.

258
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:42,763
Agreed.

259
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:45,350
- Well, we have new rules, too.

260
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:49,313
Prepare to hear them, and obey.

261
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:54,776
He's doing doll voices.
Boys are so pathetic.

262
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,862
I can't leave the house by myself?

263
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,947
You have to come with me wherever I go?

264
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,616
Why?

265
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,952
Despite Captain Grakker's
previous warnings,

266
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:07,164
we're still concerned
you might feel it necessary

267
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,791
to alert our presence to your government.

268
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,795
So? Most people think
aliens are somewhere out there, anyway.

269
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,379
My dad did.

270
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,716
- That's only because your dad is a...

271
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,010
- Zip it.
- Fine.

272
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,514
Oops. Loose module.

273
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:27,476
Okay, okay.
I promise not to tell a word,

274
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,562
but I still have a ton of homework to do
before tomorrow,

275
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,857
and if you both come with me,
then who's gonna fix your ship?

276
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,817
The rest of the crew.

277
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,237
The rest of the... Who?

278
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:41,198
Greetings upon you, Earth child.

279
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:45,452
I am Tar Gibbons,
Ship's Master of Warrior Science.

280
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,829
Greetings back upon you, Tar?

281
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:52,459
"Tar" isn't a name.
It's a title, like "Mister," or "Doctor,"

282
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:55,087
though, your world
has no exact equivalent.

283
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,090
Inexactly,
it would be something like,

284
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,259
"Wise and beloved warrior,

285
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,845
who could kill me with his little finger,
if he should so desire."

286
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,597
Good to know.

287
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:10,811
And I am the one, the only
Phillogenous esk Piemondum.

288
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:15,440
Ship's Pilot and Communications Officer,
but you can call me Phil.

289
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,360
How can you talk? You're a plant.

290
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:21,071
I am? No wonder I feel soiled.

291
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,448
- Ooh. Good one.

292
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,450
How many dolls does he have in there?

293
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,832
I will, Aunt Gwen!

294
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,463
Mickey. I'm a friend of Rod's.

295
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:39,881
He has friends?

296
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,599
Anyway, can you just tell him
I got something to show him on the porch?

297
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,886
Go up and tell him yourself.

298
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,307
No can do. This is gonna get messy.

299
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:53,687
A moment, my Captain,

300
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,939
but I don't believe
the flarving valve goes there.

301
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:02,070
Goes there now.

302
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,532
Might that not destroy
all lifeforms within 50 kreltins?

303
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:08,368
Well, animal life, sure.
What's your point?

304
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,079
- May I come in?
- Busy.

305
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:12,581
There's a Mickey on the porch.

306
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,224
He's got something he wants you to see.

307
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:15,625
Be right down!

308
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,670
Whatever. I'll be in the kitchen.

309
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,103
And no energy-inversion
life-destroying stuff while I'm gone.

310
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,022
Aw. He's no fun.

311
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:00,921
Perfect timing!

312
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:02,923
I know! Just wait 'til you see this!

313
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:05,092
I got your volcano problem solved!

314
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:07,803
Wait. I have something huge
to tell you first.

315
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,930
About that girl

316
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:12,557
Mickey. I have aliens in my room.

317
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,392
She doesn't look like an alien.

318
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:16,561
Not Elspeth. She's my cousin.

319
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:19,064
But I have real aliens,

320
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:22,442
and they crashed through my window
with their spaceship,

321
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,903
and they're really small,
and they need my help,

322
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:26,822
but you can't tell anybody,

323
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,533
because if they knew I told you,
they'd kill me.

324
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,034
They have ray-guns.

325
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:34,371
- Mickey, come on. You know I never lie.

326
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:35,288
Yeah.

327
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,707
So, that means I'm telling...

328
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:38,991
- Setting me up!
- The truth!

329
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,129
- Mickey...
- Getting back to planet Earth.

330
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,342
Doing a volcano
with baking soda and vinegar

331
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:49,636
is, like, so old-timey,

332
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:55,684
but this is cutting-edge.

333
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:59,729
Ingredient X, my latest invention.
Here, hold this.

334
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,735
Now, this is a safety pin.
It's really important.

335
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,464
It's really important
that you don't accidentally pull this out,

336
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:09,614
and then hit this lever.

337
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,079
Hit the deck!

338
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,392
Whoa.

339
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:40,228
Uh... So, gotta...

340
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,023
You know, dinner.

341
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:49,029
- Bye!

342
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:53,867
Well, that sucks, but I can fix it.

343
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:00,456
Where's Elspeth?

344
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,418
I thought she was upstairs with you.
Can you go get her?

345
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:10,383
Hey!

346
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,177
The papier-mache is off limits to aliens!

347
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,012
You're the alien on this crew, buddy.

348
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:16,056
This structure's simple
molecular composition

349
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,892
makes it very suitable
for rapid energy conversion.

350
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:22,395
I don't care if it's vitamin-filled.
I need to take this to school.

351
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:26,191
Rod, there is much more at stake here
than just your volcano.

352
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,984
Really? Like...

353
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,196
What was that?

354
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:34,658
Some rude bud-plucker
stumbled in without an invite.

355
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:39,454
I'll set up the brain-wiper
to erase its mind, assuming it's got one.

356
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:47,379
Did you really have to do
whatever this is?

357
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:50,715
What? Would you have preferred
total disintegration?

358
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:53,760
Ooh. That's my favorite.
A little... Problem solved.

359
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:56,483
You need to unfreeze her. Now! Will
you vouch for her cooperation?

360
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,100
Cooperation?

361
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:03,270
Look, okay, so they're aliens,

362
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:04,997
but they need a place
to repair their ship,

363
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,741
and can't let anyone
know that they're here.

364
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,233
So, they came to me for help.

365
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,650
You?

366
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:13,989
If you promise not to tell anyone,
they'll let you go.

367
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,700
- Okay, okay!

368
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,286
- Agreed.

369
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,538
Captain Grakker, reverse the polarity.

370
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:29,921
- Don't do anything stupid!
- How about them?

371
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:33,591
They're way ahead of us, Elspeth.
They flew here in a starship.

372
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:38,346
If you're so smart,
why'd you ask Rod to help you,

373
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:44,190
I'm the one who knows how to organize, keep secrets,
and do everything better than he ever will.

374
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,856
- Hold on!

375
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:51,234
Proudly, mine does not.
Not even a nervous system.

376
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:54,946
A talking plant? That is so awesome!

377
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:58,742
There's intelligent life
on this world after all!

378
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:01,953
Wait a minute. I'm intelligent life!

379
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,538
We don't have a minute, Rod.

380
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:05,381
Not if we don't want
your mom coming up here,

381
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,833
and wondering where we are.

382
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,336
And I'm good at things, like...

383
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:12,005
Look, Rod and I have to show up
for our evening meal,

384
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,258
but we'll be right back
to work out a real plan to keep you safe.

385
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:16,926
Don't just stand there.

386
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,805
We have to keep up our appearances,
and I am the expert at that.

387
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:24,975
Don't worry.

388
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,437
I got your back.
I have everybody's back.

389
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:29,814
- I've got my back.

390
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,441
I'm not quite sure
what she means.

391
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:39,199
There is something more
we must tell you about our presence here.

392
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:40,658
We are on a mission.

393
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:44,037
Yeah, Captain Grakker
said to prevent total planetary disaster.

394
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,791
At the hand of the Galaxy's
Most Evil Wanted Criminal, B'KR.

395
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,001
- B'KR. Pay attention.

396
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:53,213
On your world, B'KR is in disguise.

397
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:55,298
To move more easily among your kind,

398
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,468
slowly and surely,
laying his plans against you.

399
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:00,512
What kind of disguise are we talking here?

400
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,680
According to our monitoring sources,

401
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:06,226
he is hiding here
under the name "Beck-Er."

402
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:09,604
Becker.

403
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:12,482
You know this bipedal meat

404
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:16,861
I know his kid. He goes to my school.
He's gotta be adopted.

405
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:21,241
Gaining the trust of the child
could help us to investigate the father.

406
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,326
Billy Becker might say he trusts you,

407
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,913
but only to get close enough
to smash a bug on your forehead.

408
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:28,832
Feels disgusting.

409
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,042
Tastes even worse.

410
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:34,838
My cousin, Venus Claptrap,
would disagree, but moving on...

411
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,674
Deputy Allbright,

412
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,552
Madame Pong and I
will accompany you to school tomorrow,

413
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:42,595
and if anything goes wrong,

414
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,973
the Galactic Patrol
will hold you accountable,

415
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,308
and you will stand trial for your crimes.

416
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,979
The Patrol does not take
the loss of its agents lightly.

417
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:53,732
Thanks. I'm sure I'll sleep
much better tonight knowing that.

418
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:57,110
In the meantime, Elspeth,
would you be so kind as to continue

419
00:28:57,193 --> 00:29:01,489
to oversee security perimeters
and the operations within Rod's house?

420
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,616
What?
Like you're not gonna remember that?

421
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,034
It's not for me.

422
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,871
It's for when something goes wrong
at your school tomorrow,

423
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:08,997
because it will.

424
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:13,543
I'll need these notes
to testify at your trial, Deputy.

425
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,091
- Hey, Mickey.

426
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,223
Did he say "aliens"?

427
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:30,143
I never said anything
about imaginary aliens.

428
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,061
Well, not "imaginary."

429
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:35,106
You said that they were really small,
and they had, like, ray-guns.

430
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,983
That's it. I'm ventilating his skull.

431
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,487
Raz. Raz. Raz.

432
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:43,531
Buddy, I thought we'd talked about this.

433
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,660
Oh. Pudge-Boy.
Just finishing up here.

434
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:58,171
Yeah, sure, whatever.

435
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:04,677
Where was I? Oh, yeah.

436
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,013
Pudge-Boy! You're just in...

437
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,768
Hey, what's this?

438
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,063
Not mint on card, but nice detailing.

439
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:16,845
Where'd you get him, Allbright?

440
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,858
I found him.

441
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:22,195
Thought so. 'Cause I lost one
just like this yesterday.

442
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,530
- But...

443
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,493
Nothing.

444
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:30,744
Thought so.

445
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:46,553
Everyone's a critic.

446
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:51,682
Hey, buddy.

447
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,436
- Hi, Mom.

448
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:58,314
The little aliens need to fix their ship.

449
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,942
Huh. Oh, of course, they do.

450
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,747
Well, just bring it back
when they're done.

451
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:03,819
Agreed.

452
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:17,750
The Basic Drake Equation
combines all your favorite subjects.

453
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,837
- Statistics, astronomy,
chemistry, and Biology.

454
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:27,844
It's a way for us to think
about how many worlds orbiting other suns

455
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:32,223
might have extraterrestrial civilizations
we could communicate with.

456
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:36,519
Astronomers know the first few numbers
to put into the equation.

457
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,689
These numbers give us a good estimate

458
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:44,611
of the number of Earth-like planets
there are in our galaxy.

459
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:48,448
Now, we get to the part of the equation

460
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:51,200
where we have to make
some educated guesses,

461
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:56,247
and these guesses involve the difference
between Chemistry and Biology.

462
00:31:56,456 --> 00:32:01,461
First, of these 40 billion
potentially Earth-like planets,

463
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,671
how many have life?

464
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:11,679
Just having simple lifeforms,
like bacteria, or plants,

465
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,057
or even small animals isn't enough.

466
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:17,644
So, then of those earth-like planets,

467
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,520
how many have intelligent life?

468
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:26,945
And then, of those planets
with intelligent life,

469
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,697
how many go on to develop radio,

470
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:34,577
or other means of communication
that we can detect from Earth?

471
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:39,791
Remember that humans lived
on Planet Earth for millions of years

472
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:42,752
before we invented radio and television,

473
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:45,296
and then lasers for sending signals.

474
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,173
- And who knows.

475
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:50,176
Maybe there are still
incredible communication technologies

476
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:51,761
that we know nothing about today,

477
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:54,055
-because we can't imagine them.

478
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,808
But they will be invented
sometime in the future.

479
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:59,811
- Maybe even by one of you.

480
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:03,856
Depending on the numbers used
in the last parts of the equation,

481
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:07,235
we get a range of possible answers,

482
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,529
so that the Drake Equation tells us

483
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:12,949
the number of possible
extraterrestrial civilizations

484
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:17,912
can be anywhere from one, ours,
to more than 30 million!

485
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:22,417
Whatever the true answer
to the Drake Equation turns out to be,

486
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:26,004
a big number
into the hundreds of thousands,

487
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,631
or a small number
that you can count on your hands...

488
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:29,590
Yes!

489
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,050
Or simply one,

490
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,886
it will be something
that will change our understanding

491
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,347
of the universe as we now know it.

492
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:41,185
As the famous science-fiction writer,
Arthur C. Clarke, once said,

493
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:44,355
"Sometimes I think
we're alone in the universe,"

494
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:46,399
and sometimes I think we're not.

495
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:49,944
"In either case,
the idea is quite staggering."

496
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:58,536
All right, class,
please take out your science textbooks,

497
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:01,497
and we are going to go to Chapter 10.

498
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,250
That is page 79.

499
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:07,962
Now, pay attention

500
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:11,466
because this is definitely
going to be on the final exam.

501
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:14,802
Do I have a volunteer
to read the first paragraph?

502
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,139
Spa Fon!

503
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:21,142
Whoa. Little pitcher plants have big ears.

504
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:24,278
Let me handle this, and when I say,
"Handle," I mean, "leaf" it to me.

505
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:25,730
Ooh! Another good one!

506
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:29,567
Apologies, youngling.
My choice of words were most intemperate.

507
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,152
You should hear my dad.

508
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,946
Indeed. As the snavel
and wonkus teaches us,

509
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:37,825
we should all listen to our parents
from whom much wisdom flows.

510
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,744
So, how does a plant...

511
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:42,705
Well, how does anyone
get to join the Galactic Patrol?

512
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:45,500
Each has his, her, or its reason.

513
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,336
Phil here is on a quest for his roots.

514
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,463
I'm working my asparagus off.

515
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:52,840
How about you?

516
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:57,428
Warrior Science compels all who are able
to protect those who are not.

517
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,723
But if you all join for different reasons,

518
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:04,060
doesn't that make you all argue
about what to do and how to do it?

519
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:07,480
Clever youngling.
A healthy differing of opinions

520
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:11,359
is as necessary as the frelnik
and groof in spring. Well said.

521
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:12,652
Okay.

522
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:15,071
As you can see, despite our differences,

523
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:18,199
the <i>Ferkel's</i> crew are united
as members of the same team,

524
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,493
helping each other
to accomplish our mission,

525
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,537
just like you and your cousin.

526
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,455
What.

527
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:26,290
We're not on any team.

528
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:28,960
Young Elspeth,
you must ignore the confusing surface,

529
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:31,129
and dig down to find the truth beneath it.

530
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:34,298
That is where you will discover
what unites you with Rod.

531
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:37,260
Yeah, like cracking open
a weird-looking nut shell

532
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:39,470
to find the good stuff inside.

533
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,097
Think on that, young Elspeth,

534
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,934
and you will see what connects you
with Rod instead of what does not.

535
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:48,229
I guess it wouldn't hurt to... Hold on.

536
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,941
It's only been there, like, forever.

537
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,443
I think I know
what's wrong with your ship.

538
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,612
Squa Tront!

539
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:15,213
Yeah!

540
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,350
Is that gonna be enough for lunch?

541
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,729
Oh, yes. Earth paper
is surprisingly nutritious.

542
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:33,399
Yeah, you should try it sometime.
It will blow your mind!

543
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:35,735
I love this stuff!

544
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,122
Those for the aliens?

545
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,290
Uh-huh.

546
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,542
Okay.

547
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,215
Hmm.

548
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,847
All right, Allbright! Give it back!

549
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:06,264
Give what back?

550
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:11,103
You know, the little monster guy.
You stole him from my bag.

551
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,730
I didn't. Honest.

552
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:16,317
You telling me he just crawled out
and walked off on his own?

553
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,253
What're you trying to pull,
Pudge.

554
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:19,487
Nothing!

555
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,466
I'm just trying to get through the day
without getting my face pounded in.

556
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,660
Well, better luck tomorrow.

557
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:05,908
Ow!

558
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,415
How did you move so fast?

559
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:13,916
Look at all the practice I've had.

560
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,586
We are not done!

561
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,879
Whoa. I got you.

562
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:24,510
Did you guys do that?

563
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:28,180
Madame Pong has performed
an act of temporal displacement,

564
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:31,892
and it has temporarily harshed her mellow.

565
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,603
You really need to start
on some language lessons.

566
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,034
The aliens need our plants?

567
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,703
No. Just Phil.

568
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:51,829
Phil?

569
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,080
He's lonely.

570
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:57,084
Huh. This is getting weird.

571
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,909
What.

572
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:35,915
Busted!

573
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,251
Execute Plan 'B'!

574
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:40,920
Begin Operation Cover-up.

575
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:47,301
Sorry, guys. Be quiet.

576
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:52,889
Ooh. Hello.

577
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,141
Hi, Aunt Gwen.

578
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,851
We're having quiet time.

579
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,687
Mmm. Amazing.

580
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,031
What's this?

581
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:21,972
Are the little aliens all done with these?

582
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:25,089
Yep. Mission accomplished.

583
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,968
I'll just bring them back
to the kitchen, then.

584
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:33,973
- Carry on.
- Will do, Aunt Gwen.

585
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,189
That was close.

586
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,822
All right, class.
Before we get started this afternoon,

587
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:53,075
I'll go ahead
and collect your math worksheets.

588
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,368
Thank you.

589
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,286
You good in there?

590
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,163
It's pretty good, yeah. Thank you.

591
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,873
All is well, young Allbright.

592
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,250
- I couldn't eat another shred.
- Make sure you got

593
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,168
- your name on the sheet. I can.

594
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:04,545
Fortunately, we found
an emergency back-up supply.

595
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:06,464
Thank you.

596
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:15,890
You want some, kiddo?

597
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:20,352
No.

598
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:27,943
Rod, is your worksheet done?

599
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:31,280
Yes, but I can't hand it in right now.

600
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,073
Because?

601
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:37,203
Aliens ate my homework, Ms. Maloney.

602
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:49,340
<i>As a reminder, gym classes
are canceled for the rest of the week</i>

603
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:51,743
<i>- because of science fair preparations.</i>
- Get back in here!

604
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,595
<i>Principal Carter will judge
the exhibits tomorrow afternoon</i>

605
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,764
<i>and award ribbons in ten categories.</i>

606
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,599
<i>In the event of a snow day,</i>

607
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,976
<i>judging will take place
after the winter break.</i>

608
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:05,731
<i>The computer club will meet
in room 11011110</i>

609
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:09,652
<i>at 00:00:001:00.</i>

610
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:12,488
<i>The cleaning staff requests
that students please remove</i>

611
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:15,115
<i>all perishable food items
from lockers by Friday.</i>

612
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:17,034
Hey, check this out, man.

613
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:18,953
Shock Rocks.

614
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,247
No! No, come on...

615
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:25,167
Mmm. Ahh.

616
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:30,965
Uh...

617
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,342
Well, Rod seemed...

618
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:38,264
You thought X was good?
Y is even better.

619
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,319
Oh.

620
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,543
- No, no, no.

621
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:09,044
Go away, go away!

622
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:25,853
Oh, my God!

623
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,289
Send them home.

624
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:48,417
Can you believe it? Hardly any detention.

625
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,754
They're probably afraid
you'll explode on school property.

626
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,172
Yeah! Awesome, wasn't it?

627
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:56,717
Ingredient Z will make
the best volcano ever!

628
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:59,219
Maybe I should just stick
with what I know will work.

629
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,222
Like what.

630
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:06,226
They're not my aliens. They're...

631
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,560
What?

632
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:10,731
They're classified.

633
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,697
- Oh, my gosh.
- Hey!

634
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,663
Oh.
Greetings upon you, Earth child.

635
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,083
You have arrived
at a most fortuitous time.

636
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:34,088
Elspeth has solved the puzzle
of our malfunctioning embiggener.

637
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,590
Her? No way.

638
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:39,259
We thought the problemo
was with all the, you know,

639
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:42,513
science-y techno-thingles
on the inside of the ship.

640
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:43,596
Super complicated.

641
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:47,601
Would melt your little meaty brain
and make it go all gooey and like that.

642
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:48,685
Well, it would.

643
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:50,229
But with the eyes of a warrior,

644
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:54,274
Elspeth perceived that which no one else
could see on the outside of the ship.

645
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:56,318
A part fell off. See?

646
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:59,029
It's called a Hydrocoptic Marzul Vane.

647
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:01,949
Without it,
the <i>Ferkel's</i> embiggener won't work.

648
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:04,243
- Commendations, Earthling.
- Come on.

649
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:06,829
The only reason she found it
is because I wasn't here.

650
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:08,038
Give up, Roddie.

651
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:11,375
I guess I'll just need to find
a new Hydrophobic Martian Cane.

652
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,127
Hydrocoptic Marzul Vane.

653
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:16,713
The Tar says Earth science
isn't advanced enough to make one.

654
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:20,175
So, the <i>Ferkel</i> might be small forever,
and so will her crew.

655
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:24,763
Backwater worlds are all alike.
Nothing useful anywhere!

656
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:28,767
No. Earth has something
no other world has.

657
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,270
B'KR.

658
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:34,314
If Billy Becker's father
really is an alien,

659
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,067
he'll have alien technology, too, right?

660
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:42,823
Not bad for a lifeform
lacking chlorophyll and leaves.

661
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:46,702
I propose we act on Deputy Allbright's
brilliant plan at once.

662
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:48,787
- Agreed.

663
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:50,998
Um, what brilliant plan?

664
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:52,833
What he said.

665
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:57,337
If B'KR has what we need,
then we must take it.

666
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:06,889
Pew! Pew! Zap! Pew!

667
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,350
Bye, Mom! Don't forget my volcano!

668
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,728
Oh, I'll drop it off
as soon as the babysitter gets here.

669
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:14,271
Elspeth, are you going out, too?

670
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:18,275
I'm gonna show her my school.
She can use my old bike.

671
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:21,028
Sounds good. Well, have a nice time.

672
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:23,197
- Thanks, Mom. See ya!
- Bye.

673
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,658
Isn't it nice to see
your brother and cousin

674
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,243
getting along so well?

675
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:32,247
They're only doing it because the mean
little alien said if they didn't...

676
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,999
He'd fry their brains with his ray-guns.

677
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:35,918
Pew! Pew! Zap!

678
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:39,129
Well, why would
the mean little alien say that?

679
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,925
- That's classified!
- That's classified!

680
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:44,509
Oh.

681
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:49,264
I've never seen it snow
just in one spot. It's crazy!

682
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:51,475
My mom says
it's only happened once before,

683
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:55,062
right about when she met my dad,
a huge snowstorm, just in Seldom Seen.

684
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,147
Isn't anything normal around here?

685
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:01,485
There, I showed you my school.
Technically, I didn't lie to Mom.

686
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,071
Just like your dad, huh?

687
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:07,074
My dad never lied.
What's wrong with that?

688
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:09,826
Rod, your father left you.

689
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:11,787
He promised he'd come back.

690
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:16,375
And you believed him?
Adults lie, all the time.

691
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:18,835
"There's nothing
to be worried about, sweetie."

692
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:22,548
"Everything's going
to be okay, honey." As if.

693
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:27,469
Maybe your parents lie to you,
but not mine, and not my dad.

694
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:31,640
If he's so great, then where is he?

695
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:36,269
We've got to go.

696
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,398
Let's hurry up.
I've never ditched school before.

697
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:05,799
Status report from the flight deck.

698
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:14,099
The <i>Ferkel's</i> scan is complete.

699
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:17,686
No intelligent life inside the house,

700
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:20,022
<i>and no human life, either...</i>

701
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:22,816
<i>- Phil, that's not helpful.</i>

702
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:36,455
Ew. It smells.

703
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:41,960
Yeah, like pizza.

704
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:48,300
Boys. It's like adults
don't even live here.

705
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:50,886
You don't have to be a kid to like pizza.

706
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,389
Ew! Ugh!

707
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,648
Oh, my gosh, he killed them!
He killed them!

708
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:04,316
Billy Becker killed his parents!

709
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:08,779
- Ooh. Ew.

710
00:49:09,946 --> 00:49:11,073
<i>Those aren't real.</i>

711
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:14,743
They're artificial replicas
too advanced for Earth.

712
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:19,331
So, alien android parents?

713
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:20,456
Parentoids.

714
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:23,085
I guess.

715
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:26,421
But if Billy Becker's father isn't real,

716
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,840
then that means the real B'KR is...

717
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:30,174
- Billy.
- Billy.

718
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:38,850
- I believe in aliens.

719
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,894
Do you have something
harder to believe than that?

720
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:47,442
Billy, my archenemy,
the rotten, lying little kid.

721
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:50,487
He's a fugitive mastermind
from another planet,

722
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,906
wanted across the galaxy
for his hideous crimes.

723
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:58,565
I mean, a lot of kids get bullied
at one point or another,

724
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:00,223
but how many get bullied by a kid

725
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:03,166
who turns out to be a criminal genius
from the stars in disguise?

726
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:04,751
Sort of cool, really.

727
00:50:05,627 --> 00:50:06,627
What?

728
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:10,382
I mean, it's not like you're some loser
who gets bullied by anyone.

729
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:13,552
You get bullied
by an advanced alien intellect.

730
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:15,762
Not a lot of people can put up with that.

731
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,056
So, I'm not a loser?

732
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:21,393
Not when it comes
to standing up to an alien menace,

733
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:26,398
<i>but you sort of dress funny,
and, you know, a diet couldn't...</i>

734
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:34,573
And we're down.

735
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:37,033
<i>At least there's a bright side
to Billy Becker being B'KR.</i>

736
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:38,952
<i>Bright side.</i>

737
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:41,163
<i>This is B'KR's hangout.</i>

738
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:45,417
Right? He's got to have
some sort of cool alien tech stuff here,

739
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:48,211
maybe even something
that can fix the embiggener.

740
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,881
<i>A most timely reminder, young deputy.</i>

741
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:55,051
Captain, we should begin our interior
probe of this domicile at once.

742
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:59,556
You two, search this room.
Report if you find what we need.

743
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:00,681
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

744
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:23,955
Only an alien can eat
this much junk food and live.

745
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:28,877
He's got all the latest games,
but I've never seen this one before.

746
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,728
Never seen this before, either.

747
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,605
We're not here to play, Roddie.

748
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:51,399
This is serious.

749
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:56,321
What if this is some sort of
alien game console with alien games.

750
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:57,447
Looks like a map.

751
00:51:57,531 --> 00:52:02,244
Whatever it is, it looks like that part's
some sort of alien countdown.

752
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:08,542
Mom, Dad, I'm home early!

753
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,752
Begin Operation Cover-up!

754
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:15,465
Come on. Hurry up!

755
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:26,685
Feels good to be home.

756
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:32,691
Oh. Hey, Roger.

757
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:49,081
How was your day?

758
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:50,834
Oh, that's right.

759
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:55,046
I ripped out all your good parts
to make something halfway useful.

760
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:56,673
Bit brains.

761
00:52:57,757 --> 00:52:58,757
Boop!

762
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:05,098
Ugh. Time to slip out of this old thing.

763
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,108
Ah. Sweet dwarf star.

764
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:39,382
Hello, Pudge-Boy and friend.

765
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:53,438
I guess that's how he can afford
all those games.

766
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:54,940
I wonder if it's real.

767
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:57,651
Rod, we need to find
a way to get out of here!

768
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,319
I know. Check through the windows.

769
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:03,698
The <i>Ferkel</i> can't blast through these.
It's steel. We're trapped!

770
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:05,659
Where is the <i>Ferkel,</i> anyway?

771
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:12,540
Maybe he didn't see us come in here.

772
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,961
- Or maybe I did!

773
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:26,929
Hey, kids!

774
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:29,265
Rod, what are we going to do?

775
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:34,228
Huh?

776
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:54,124
I know where you live, Allbright,
and I know how to hurt you.

777
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:03,842
Almost down, almost.

778
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:09,097
Perfect landing.

779
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:11,683
Um, why are you all so big?

780
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:13,560
Uh, we're not.

781
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:15,812
Then that means we're...

782
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:17,981
- You are, yeah.
- But if you can't...

783
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,358
- Then we can't...
- Correct.

784
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:23,153
No! Not correct! I can't be small!

785
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:27,865
You're small.

786
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:33,788
Elspeth, we're all small.
It's not just about you.

787
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:36,124
Yeah. What he said.

788
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:43,423
Linda, Eric, you be good
for Mrs. Nesbitt, okay?

789
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:45,091
- Okay, Mom.
- Okay, Mom.

790
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,855
I'll see you later in the afternoon, okay?

791
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:48,738
- See you tonight, Mrs. Allbright.
- Bye! Have fun!

792
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:49,762
- Bye.
- Bye.

793
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:45,318
Do these come in any other color?

794
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:48,613
Actually, you look sort of cool.

795
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:49,823
You do, too, I guess.

796
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:58,831
Plink!

797
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,082
What was that?

798
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:02,460
- Plink!

799
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:05,380
Yes. Like most plants, Phil has a runner.

800
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:07,632
Hello, Plinkster! He's my best bud.

801
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:11,219
Though, the term "symbiote"
would be more precise.

802
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:15,348
On their homeworld, plants and runners
co-evolved to help each other.

803
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:16,431
Plink!

804
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:23,356
Ooh! Just the thing
for my root canal.

805
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:25,066
I've identified the image.

806
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:28,027
Hey, we saw that at Billy's.

807
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:29,362
How'd you find it?

808
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:31,781
Scanned it
when we plucked you out of there.

809
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:35,493
I might be going out on a limb,
but it's obviously a map.

810
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:37,704
Map? Obviously.

811
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:41,332
Okay, okay. You were right.
Map of what?

812
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:43,877
B'KR's planning to build a hypertunnel.

813
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:48,298
Dimensional instabilities are already
disturbing our atmosphere here.

814
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:50,675
Is that why we're getting
so much crazy snow?

815
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:54,387
And it will get even crazier
until this countdown ends.

816
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:55,763
Countdown?

817
00:57:55,847 --> 00:58:00,768
In one hour, two minutes,
26.4 seconds from now, roughly.

818
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:02,580
So, what will happen
when the countdown ends

819
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:03,897
and the hypertunnel opens?

820
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:07,484
In a nutshell,
the end of your world as you know it.

821
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:15,366
We knew B'KR was planning
the total destruction of the Earth.

822
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:19,162
This shows us how he intends
to achieve it.

823
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:23,333
Alcatron Prime,
the Patrol's super prison planetoid.

824
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:27,003
It holds thousands
of the galaxy's super-worst criminals.

825
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:29,421
Planet Earth.

826
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:34,761
More like ex-planet Earth,
as in excruciatingly exterminated.

827
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:36,888
Explosively extinguished.

828
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:39,265
- Extremely... That's enough.

829
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,433
What?

830
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:43,686
Why would B'KR release
thousands of galactic criminals here?

831
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:46,022
The simple answer is to be cruel.

832
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:48,525
In the civilized galaxy,

833
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:51,444
cruelty to others
is the greatest crime of all,

834
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:55,490
and B'KR is the greatest criminal
of them all.

835
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:56,908
Millions have wept.

836
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:00,912
- There's got to be a way to stop him.
- There is!

837
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:05,166
The flashing countdown thingy
shows how long we have till your world

838
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,502
and the prison planetoid align in,

839
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:10,713
like, a dimensional web
that is really complicated,

840
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:13,299
and you'll never understand it,

841
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:17,929
but that's when B'KR will need
an Activator to make his hypertunnel.

842
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:20,265
So, if we find an Activator...

843
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:23,601
Then we can destroy it before he gets
a chance to create the tunnel.

844
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:26,521
And the galactic super criminals
won't be able to invade Earth.

845
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:32,610
In 58 minutes,
3.2 seconds from now, more or less.

846
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:34,696
So, how do we find an Activator?

847
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:37,198
It'll be close
to the dimensional disruption

848
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:39,117
that's causing your strange weather.

849
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:41,953
So, it's in my school?

850
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,621
Bingo, sprout.

851
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:46,332
But to find exactly
where B'KR's hidden it,

852
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,334
we'll need roots on the ground.

853
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:49,751
What's going on?

854
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:54,048
Incoming communication
on the galactic emergency band!

855
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,931
<i>Hello, Galactic Patrol.</i>

856
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,641
Hey, he's in my house!

857
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:06,311
<i>Oh! This is good. Do you mind?</i>

858
01:00:08,229 --> 01:00:10,315
<i>I'm going to make this simple,
just like all of you.</i>

859
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:15,987
<i>You have something I want,
and I have something you want.</i>

860
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:24,454
Time to fly!
Those maggots need saving.

861
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:49,979
What's that say?

862
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:52,899
It's a warning from B'KR.

863
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:55,568
Inexactly,
it translates something like,

864
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:57,779
"Captain Grakker, surrender your crew,

865
01:00:57,945 --> 01:01:00,323
or the grublings will be forever blue."

866
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:05,244
Those poor corn kernels!
He popped them to pieces. Murderer!

867
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:08,706
Activate external speakers.

868
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:11,584
Now, you're talking!

869
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:15,797
<i>B'KR, release the grublings at once!</i>

870
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:18,007
No. Not until you give up,

871
01:01:18,257 --> 01:01:23,096
<i>or else the Allbright brats
will remain frozen forever.</i>

872
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:30,269
Captain, there's only one
course of action that we can take.

873
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:33,730
Surrender.

874
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:39,487
Well, according to the Galactic Code,
all larva must be protected.

875
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:43,157
Remember, all is not lost
until all is lost.

876
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:45,827
- Yeah.

877
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:51,249
B'KR, hear my words.

878
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:54,711
We will surrender,
but only if you free the larva.

879
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:57,547
<i>Done. Now, get in here.</i>

880
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:04,220
Open sesame seed.

881
01:02:36,794 --> 01:02:38,671
My scans show six crew on board,

882
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:41,466
<i>so, I want all six to surrender,
no weapons,</i>

883
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:43,134
<i>and then I'll release my captives.</i>

884
01:02:44,343 --> 01:02:47,805
- Shutting down all systems ASAP.

885
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:54,854
Wait. There're seven of us, not six.

886
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:58,816
B'KR must've just scanned for animal life.
He doesn't know about Phil.

887
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:02,779
That's his loss,
because I am a plant worth knowing.

888
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:05,948
Then Warrior Science
tells us exactly what to do next.

889
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:07,241
Young humans, come closer.

890
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:10,369
- Hey!

891
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,120
Ow!

892
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:13,371
What was that for?

893
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:14,957
A simple transfer of knowledge,

894
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:17,502
so, you will know how to act
when the time is right.

895
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,546
An anti.

896
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:23,132
What, you thought it was just
to hold up your pants?

897
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:24,217
Hah. Yeah.

898
01:03:24,842 --> 01:03:26,302
This is amazing, Rod.

899
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:29,847
I know how to work this.
I know how to fly!

900
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:33,267
- A simple transfer of knowledge.
- For when the time is right.

901
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:57,792
Hello, Pudge-Boy and friends,
including Captain Grakker.

902
01:03:58,417 --> 01:04:00,127
I thought I recognized you at school.

903
01:04:00,419 --> 01:04:02,547
We have a deal, B'KR!

904
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,732
- That tickled!
- Again!

905
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:44,255
What a stimulating
collection of artifacts.

906
01:04:44,338 --> 01:04:47,216
The intellect that chose them
must be of the highest order.

907
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:49,260
Linda's always messing with my stuff.

908
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:52,638
- Status report.

909
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:55,808
I am harshed, yet retain my mellowness.

910
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:58,269
I am fully operational.

911
01:04:58,352 --> 01:05:01,439
- I'm not. This place is a mess, Rod.

912
01:05:01,522 --> 01:05:04,108
Ow! I hit something really hard.

913
01:05:05,943 --> 01:05:07,737
What the heck is this thing, anyway?

914
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:09,280
Plink!

915
01:05:09,363 --> 01:05:11,908
Flibbix be honored!
It is a Warrior Miracle!

916
01:05:12,116 --> 01:05:14,535
Rod, you've found the missing piece
of the embiggener.

917
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:17,788
The Hippo Marsupial Weathervane?

918
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:20,541
Hydrocoptic... Never mind.

919
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:23,669
Linda must've shoved it in here
the day you trashed my window.

920
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:26,923
All we have to do now
to enlarge the <i>Ferkel</i> and ourselves...

921
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:30,551
Is put the Vane back in its proper place
on the outside of the ship.

922
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:33,012
We're locked inside a smelly backpack.

923
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:35,026
How are we going to get back
on the <i>Ferkel?</i>

924
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:37,141
As Warrior Science teaches us,

925
01:05:37,224 --> 01:05:40,436
Planjite-fribble wasn't smelled
with a single sniff.

926
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:42,521
Mmm-hmm.

927
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:43,605
True.

928
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:00,998
Time to shake things up.

929
01:06:04,418 --> 01:06:05,503
What's he doing?

930
01:06:05,586 --> 01:06:07,421
- Shaking us!

931
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:09,382
He probably thinks it's funny.

932
01:06:10,257 --> 01:06:11,801
Millions have wept.

933
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:13,678
Make that a million and one.

934
01:06:57,471 --> 01:06:59,098
This is our chance to escape.

935
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:01,642
How? We're upside down on the flap.

936
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:04,979
Warrior Science teaches us
that when there is no other choice...

937
01:07:05,396 --> 01:07:08,524
We make the choice we must.

938
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:11,068
- The Berserker Module.
- Yeah.

939
01:07:16,824 --> 01:07:19,076
Captain Grakker, are you ready?

940
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:21,954
Madame Pong, I am a Friskian fighter.

941
01:07:22,329 --> 01:07:25,207
I was ready the day
I was extruded from the vats.

942
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:33,049
Time to get this party started.

943
01:07:42,516 --> 01:07:43,517
Everyone back.

944
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,527
Grakker! Bad wall!

945
01:07:53,861 --> 01:07:55,905
- Bad wall! Kill!

946
01:07:56,947 --> 01:08:00,034
Bad wall! Bad wall! Die, die!

947
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:07,333
Oh-ho! Yes.

948
01:08:33,859 --> 01:08:37,613
The sap is rising.

949
01:08:40,074 --> 01:08:41,450
- Ohh.

950
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:43,577
That feels good.

951
01:08:55,589 --> 01:08:58,467
Oh! Look who's gone to seed.

952
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:02,346
Now, feel the fury
of the <i>Ferkel's</i> fearsome fighter!

953
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:03,806
Kreegah!

954
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:11,021
Kreegah!

955
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:17,069
Kreegah!

956
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:20,322
We're not on solid ground!

957
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:23,492
Grakker! No! The wall is dead!

958
01:09:26,912 --> 01:09:28,205
Brace for impact!

959
01:09:45,764 --> 01:09:49,393
The mighty Grakker triumphs!
Bad wall dead! Kreegah!

960
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:52,521
Rod, Elspeth, quickly!

961
01:09:56,984 --> 01:09:57,984
Who's next? Uh-oh.

962
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:01,614
Oh, no.

963
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:17,022
We've got to get
you guys out of here!

964
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:19,965
No, young Allbright,
you have a different mission.

965
01:10:20,424 --> 01:10:23,052
- Trust in Warrior Science!
- But, Tar...

966
01:10:27,973 --> 01:10:30,226
Oh. Right. It's time.

967
01:10:30,517 --> 01:10:33,103
Phil reports that the <i>Ferkel</i>
is back up to full power.

968
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:35,564
It's up to you now, Rod.

969
01:10:35,814 --> 01:10:39,652
Hold on. Why him?
I'm the one who saw it was missing.

970
01:10:39,735 --> 01:10:43,572
Young Elspeth, each of us
has our own part to play in this mission.

971
01:10:43,864 --> 01:10:46,992
And this one is something
an Allbright should do.

972
01:10:51,038 --> 01:10:52,831
He's getting ready to blast the <i>Ferkel!</i>

973
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:55,501
Phillogenous esk Piemondum!

974
01:10:55,834 --> 01:10:57,169
Now!

975
01:10:57,419 --> 01:11:00,089
It's mulching time!

976
01:11:09,056 --> 01:11:11,308
I feel the need for speed.

977
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:16,480
Whoo-hoo!

978
01:11:23,862 --> 01:11:26,949
This is where
the rubber tree hits the road!

979
01:11:27,032 --> 01:11:29,368
Rod! Elspeth! To the <i>Ferkel!</i>

980
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:39,503
- Whoo!

981
01:11:39,586 --> 01:11:40,921
- Whoo!

982
01:11:43,549 --> 01:11:45,551
I'd call this a face off, if I had a face.

983
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:49,805
I'm going to smush you
like a bug.

984
01:11:49,888 --> 01:11:52,182
You throw like an alien.

985
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:53,600
Huh.

986
01:11:54,351 --> 01:11:55,519
Incoming!

987
01:12:02,901 --> 01:12:04,403
Cling on tight, Rod!

988
01:12:10,617 --> 01:12:11,994
Phil, are you there?

989
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:14,830
Ready to put my petals to the metal.

990
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:17,541
Phil, steady the ship!

991
01:12:17,624 --> 01:12:20,627
I'm about to put the you-know-what
in the you-know-where.

992
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:22,796
You said it, kind of, sort of.

993
01:12:24,131 --> 01:12:25,131
He can't!

994
01:12:27,301 --> 01:12:29,470
I hate these people!

995
01:12:34,099 --> 01:12:36,810
Rod, the hypertunnel's
trying to pull us in!

996
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:43,567
I can't hold this position much longer!

997
01:12:54,286 --> 01:12:55,371
Pudge-Boy.

998
01:13:04,254 --> 01:13:05,756
Stop right there.

999
01:13:05,839 --> 01:13:08,133
You of all people
can't trust the Galactic Patrol.

1000
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:10,386
- They've been lying to you.

1001
01:13:11,011 --> 01:13:15,891
The truth about your father...
They'll never tell you, but I will!

1002
01:13:16,016 --> 01:13:19,019
<i>All you have to do is put that down.</i>

1003
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:22,648
Rod, close your earflaps.
That meatpod's the liar!

1004
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:25,234
Why should I trust you and not them?

1005
01:13:25,317 --> 01:13:27,569
I'm the only one
who can take you to your father.

1006
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:32,783
- Everything's gonna be all right.

1007
01:13:32,866 --> 01:13:33,866
Ow!

1008
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:37,496
I'll come back, Rod. I promise.

1009
01:13:40,124 --> 01:13:43,585
Simple choice, Allbright. Yes, or no?

1010
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:45,253
Dad...

1011
01:13:45,295 --> 01:13:47,131
Rod, you can't!

1012
01:13:52,219 --> 01:13:53,779
You know it's what you want, Allbright.

1013
01:13:54,346 --> 01:13:57,724
It's not about me, Billy!
There's much more at stake here!

1014
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:01,645
I'm an Allbright. I can do this.

1015
01:14:10,737 --> 01:14:12,865
The <i>Ferkel</i> is go!

1016
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:15,868
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1017
01:14:15,951 --> 01:14:18,829
- Eat my pollen, hypertunnel!
- Yes!

1018
01:14:29,047 --> 01:14:30,047
You did it!

1019
01:14:30,841 --> 01:14:32,718
Come on, Elspeth. We did it!

1020
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:34,720
You flew straight at B'KR
to save the <i>Ferkel!</i>

1021
01:14:34,928 --> 01:14:36,138
Obviously!

1022
01:14:36,221 --> 01:14:38,265
- Um...

1023
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:39,808
I don't think we're done yet.

1024
01:14:44,271 --> 01:14:46,273
I'm going to blast you all to quarks!

1025
01:14:46,356 --> 01:14:48,150
Nobody's going to mow me down.

1026
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:52,613
Flower Power!

1027
01:14:53,697 --> 01:14:56,200
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

1028
01:15:11,673 --> 01:15:13,467
Fasten your pod-belts!

1029
01:15:19,097 --> 01:15:22,893
I'll show this planet wrecker
some real fun with science.

1030
01:15:22,976 --> 01:15:26,480
Saplings,
shield your light-sensing jelly balls.

1031
01:15:26,563 --> 01:15:29,107
- I think he means our eyes.

1032
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:30,191
Now!

1033
01:15:30,275 --> 01:15:31,652
- Dang it!

1034
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:43,163
Time to pluck this weed.

1035
01:15:47,584 --> 01:15:49,086
Farewell, <i>Ferkel!</i>

1036
01:15:49,169 --> 01:15:51,547
Reflect on this, B'KR.

1037
01:15:54,424 --> 01:15:56,593
Boogers!

1038
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:04,226
Rod! Elspeth! Scanners say
the Activator's in B'KR's science project.

1039
01:16:04,309 --> 01:16:06,645
- You have to nip it in the bud.
- Huh?

1040
01:16:08,105 --> 01:16:09,105
I see it!

1041
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:13,402
How much time do we have left?

1042
01:16:13,485 --> 01:16:15,654
Three minutes and...

1043
01:16:15,737 --> 01:16:18,156
Who knows how many seconds?
Just hurry!

1044
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:21,159
- You have to shut it down.

1045
01:16:26,331 --> 01:16:27,666
I'm going to shut down Billy.

1046
01:16:30,669 --> 01:16:32,754
The gym's going to be swarming with kids.

1047
01:16:32,838 --> 01:16:35,799
And swarming with galactic criminals.

1048
01:16:37,467 --> 01:16:38,969
Phil, activate the embiggener!

1049
01:16:39,052 --> 01:16:42,139
<i>- Just for me.</i>

1050
01:16:42,306 --> 01:16:43,306
<i>Good one.</i>

1051
01:16:45,392 --> 01:16:46,810
Whoa. You got big.

1052
01:17:04,161 --> 01:17:05,287
Quit it, Pudge-Boy.

1053
01:17:05,370 --> 01:17:07,414
My name is Rod Allbright!

1054
01:17:07,497 --> 01:17:09,916
The sprout is blossoming.

1055
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:26,141
Elspeth, pull the blue wires.
Pull them all!

1056
01:17:28,727 --> 01:17:31,063
You're ruining everything.

1057
01:17:31,146 --> 01:17:32,939
Now, you know how it feels!

1058
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:35,192
Go, Rod!

1059
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,822
Rod, the galactic criminals
are almost here.

1060
01:17:53,293 --> 01:17:56,963
Let's see you all laugh at this, losers.

1061
01:18:04,971 --> 01:18:05,971
What?

1062
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:16,191
All those brave bananas just got creamed.

1063
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:40,090
The volcano?
The kid's a blooming genius.

1064
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:55,397
Elspeth! One minute and counting.

1065
01:18:57,232 --> 01:18:58,608
Rod! Ingredient Z!

1066
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:04,781
This is the big one!

1067
01:19:06,032 --> 01:19:07,284
Hey, Rod Allbright.

1068
01:19:08,493 --> 01:19:11,288
Your world is mine.

1069
01:19:12,873 --> 01:19:16,877
I don't like the sound of that,
and I don't have ears.

1070
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:20,672
- The galactic criminals are almost here!

1071
01:19:30,891 --> 01:19:32,142
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

1072
01:19:33,143 --> 01:19:37,647
Nine, eight, seven, six,

1073
01:19:38,565 --> 01:19:44,112
five, four, three,

1074
01:19:45,363 --> 01:19:46,363
two,

1075
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:48,450
one!

1076
01:19:48,575 --> 01:19:49,785
- No!

1077
01:19:49,868 --> 01:19:53,163
Elspeth, no time left. Pull everything!

1078
01:19:56,541 --> 01:19:58,251
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1079
01:20:00,378 --> 01:20:03,298
Whoo! I'm tired. I need fertilizer.

1080
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:19,940
Time to make like a tree and leaf.

1081
01:20:22,275 --> 01:20:23,485
Fart burps!

1082
01:20:35,455 --> 01:20:36,873
I saw everything.

1083
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:41,586
- Yeah, it was the best volcano ever!

1084
01:20:45,173 --> 01:20:46,800
- Gone.

1085
01:20:46,883 --> 01:20:48,969
He won't be showing
his face around here again.

1086
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:04,568
Just like his father.

1087
01:21:07,821 --> 01:21:10,657
- I'll get a mop.
- Yeah.

1088
01:22:08,131 --> 01:22:10,383
This parting is sad for me,
Young Allbright,

1089
01:22:11,176 --> 01:22:14,220
but I honor the Warrior Spirit
within you and Elspeth,

1090
01:22:14,346 --> 01:22:16,806
and wish you could travel
the stars with us.

1091
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:19,601
Thank you, Tar Gibbons.
We've learned a lot from you already.

1092
01:22:19,726 --> 01:22:21,561
At least half of it makes sense.

1093
01:22:21,645 --> 01:22:23,438
Let us hope it is the right half.

1094
01:22:23,563 --> 01:22:26,066
Oh, I don't want to get all sappy,

1095
01:22:26,232 --> 01:22:28,276
but even though you're not green,

1096
01:22:28,401 --> 01:22:32,864
you two are fine human beans...
Uh, beings.

1097
01:22:33,031 --> 01:22:34,699
- Plink!

1098
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:39,621
Rod, do you know why B'KR told you
that he knows where your father is?

1099
01:22:39,829 --> 01:22:40,829
To be cruel.

1100
01:22:41,289 --> 01:22:46,002
True, but what is also true,
is there is no way for B'KR to know

1101
01:22:46,086 --> 01:22:49,631
where your father is,
because his location and his mission...

1102
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:51,257
Are classified?

1103
01:22:51,549 --> 01:22:54,029
You mean Rod's father is a... A
member of the Galactic Patrol.

1104
01:22:57,263 --> 01:23:00,058
Is that why I knew how to get
the Hydrocoptic Marzul Vane to work?

1105
01:23:02,102 --> 01:23:05,146
Your father might have transferred
more knowledge to you than...

1106
01:23:09,442 --> 01:23:11,319
I've already said too much.

1107
01:23:11,403 --> 01:23:12,737
Take heart, young Allbright.

1108
01:23:12,904 --> 01:23:15,949
Your father would not have left
without good reason.

1109
01:23:16,157 --> 01:23:20,662
There's always a seed of hope.
Perhaps you'll see him again...

1110
01:23:21,079 --> 01:23:23,581
But only when the time is right.

1111
01:23:24,499 --> 01:23:27,043
When the galaxy is safe once again.

1112
01:23:57,657 --> 01:23:59,051
You think we'll ever see them again?

1113
01:23:59,075 --> 01:24:00,452
- I hope so.
- Me, too.

1114
01:24:00,785 --> 01:24:02,145
We're part of the team now, right?

1115
01:24:02,495 --> 01:24:05,331
- Right.
- But we still need to have that talk.

1116
01:24:05,498 --> 01:24:07,459
<i>- Star Wars.</i>

1117
01:24:07,625 --> 01:24:08,710
<i>Star Trek.</i>

1118
01:24:08,793 --> 01:24:11,004
The Force beats the Federation any day.

1119
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:14,632
The Klingons beat
the Rebel Alliance any day.

1120
01:24:15,216 --> 01:24:17,302
Warrior Science says this isn't over.

1121
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:19,137
- Until it's over.

1122
01:24:19,345 --> 01:24:21,222
Hey! Guys! Did you see that?

1123
01:24:27,604 --> 01:24:30,648
The <i>Starship Ferkel.</i>
Part of the Galactic Patrol.

1124
01:24:30,815 --> 01:24:34,819
Its crew are all aliens.
Its pilot is a potted plant.

1125
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:39,866
You guys!
I almost believed you that time.

1126
01:24:40,241 --> 01:24:41,534
There's always next time.

1127
01:24:47,707 --> 01:24:50,293
You were joking
about those little aliens, right?

1128
01:24:51,169 --> 01:24:52,295
That's classified.

1129
01:26:16,963 --> 01:26:22,218
<i>"And Billy Becker was banned
from this dimension for 50 keltrons,</i>

with no hope of getting out."</i>
