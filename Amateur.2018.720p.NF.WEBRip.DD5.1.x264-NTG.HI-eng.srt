00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:21,020
[upbeat music playing]

2
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,443
[woman] Come this way, Terron.

3
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,824
[man] Come on, T. Quick, quick.

4
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:37,704
[boy 1] Oh!

5
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:46,921
[laughs]

6
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,593
- [crowd cheering]
- [boy 1] Let's go, T.

7
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,304
Splash!

8
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,896
Whoo!

9
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,948
[girl 1] Give it back.
You're gonna drop it.

10
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,078
Why are you watching my video anyway?
Watch this.

11
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,831
Oh, yeah, layup.

12
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,292
Right? Stoned.

13
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,086
- [girl 2] Is that game?
- No. Ten to two.

14
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,715
- One more and we beat them.
- Come on. I wanna keep playing.

15
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,509
[boy 1] Win already.

16
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:33,884
All right, whatever.

17
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:37,680
Let me see that back.

18
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:40,725
Whoop. [chuckles]

19
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,894
[girl 1] Come on, Terron.

20
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:46,439
End the game, already. Oh, my God.

21
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,149
[school bell ringing]

22
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,651
[Terron] Oh, come on.

23
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,110
Damn.

24
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:02,664
[Doug] So, picking up from last class,
we're still dealing with probabilities.

25
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:05,291
But today we're gonna apply them
to your lives.

26
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,961
The chances of doing something.

27
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:12,757
The odds, the likelihood.
Who's got something?

28
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,135
- Anyone?
- [boy 1] What draft pick

29
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,595
- will Terron be in the NBA?
- [Doug] That's a good one.

30
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:18,847
Let's look it up.

31
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:23,184
We can do that as probabilities
and express them as percentages.

32
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,479
Odds of getting into the NBA.

33
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,358
We have 500,000 high school players.

34
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,404
A hundred and fifty thousand are seniors.
We have 18,000 college players.

35
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,293
Four thousand of whom are on scholarship.

36
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,337
Sixty NBA draft picks.

37
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,924
Thirty in the first round.

38
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,512
Fourteen lottery picks.

39
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,933
[Terron] See how I stepped back?
I was like...

40
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,728
[boy 1] Looks like a reverse layup
on Marcus. Man.

41
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:07,811
[Terron] And one.

42
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,732
- All right, bro.
- I'm heading out. See you.

43
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,818
[Terron] All right, bro. See you.

44
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,129
[sighs]

45
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:34,547
Yo, Pops. Where you at?

46
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:48,853
Ma, you're probably teaching
right now, but I'm at school.

47
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,980
Dad still hasn't come get me yet.

48
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,234
<i>My phone is about to die, so...
you guys hurry up.</i>

49
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:31,729
[horn honks]

50
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,283
Baby.
What, are you gonna walk the whole way?

51
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,035
- [Terron] What else was I supposed to do?
- [sighs]

52
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:51,791
I'm sorry. We tried to call you,
but we couldn't reach you.

53
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:52,959
Yeah, my phone died.

54
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:57,005
- Did his phone die, too?
- Well, he couldn't find it.

55
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:00,049
Today is not one of his good days.

56
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,064
I've gotta get my pills. Hold up.

57
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,734
Oh, Vince. I gotta get to class.

58
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,406
[sighs] They're gonna be done
with their tests by now.

59
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,453
Speaking of tests...

60
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,915
They ain't posted them yet.

61
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,835
It went that badly, huh?

62
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:41,924
How do you expect me to be great if you
kick me off the team for one bad grade?

63
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,469
Why can't you just let me
give it all I got?

64
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:47,846
Wait.

65
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:53,102
When I'm done teaching, why am I
dropping the car off at your dad's work?

66
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:58,775
So he can drive it back when he
finishes his shift. His double-shift.

67
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,777
And why does he have to do that?

68
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:04,697
I don't know. Because he got
hit in the head too many times?

69
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,992
- Stop. I'm serious. Why?
- I'm serious, too. It's the truth.

70
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:11,954
He's doing it because he
"gave it all he got."

71
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,709
I'm not gonna end up like him.

72
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:20,129
I don't even play the same sport he does.

73
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:22,297
Did.

74
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:27,929
- "Riverside" on three. One, two, three.
- [all] Riverside.

75
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,222
[crowd cheering]

76
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,854
T, let's go.

77
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:42,151
Y'all get some popcorn.
There's about to be a show up in here.

78
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,610
You have to put somebody else
on him, coach.

79
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:28,781
Dude's in, like, the 9th grade, man.
Come on. Let's go. Get up.

80
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,077
Come on. Go, go, go. Keep going. Hit him.

81
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,289
Eighth grade.

82
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,554
- Let's go.
- Here. Right here. Force him left.

83
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,098
Force him left.

84
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,561
Lock him down.

85
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:09,864
Finish the game strong.
Make the right play. Let's go.

86
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,742
Let's go, boy. Let's go.

87
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:17,413
Come on. Hold it for the last shot.
Hold it for the last shot.

88
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:23,377
Okay, T. You got 12, 11, ten, nine...

89
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,713
Hold it. Hold it.

90
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,841
Now, go. Five. Four...

91
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:38,476
Finish that shit yourself.
Take the fucking shot. Goddamn it.

92
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,229
- [Doug] You made the right play, Terron.
- Thanks, coach.

93
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,400
Forget about the L, baby.
Look at this. We bigtime.

94
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,819
Fifty thousand views, huh?
Give it up.

95
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,364
Go shake them up.

96
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,618
Hey, good game.
Good game, guys. Good game.

97
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,370
Good game, guys. Good game.

98
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,207
There it is. All right.

99
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,377
You a point guard.
But you ain't always gonna be up top.

100
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:08,965
You ended up on big dog, earlier.
What was that move you came with?

101
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,343
Did I feel something?
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

102
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,931
Did somebody leave a window open?
I think I felt a breeze. Oh, no.

103
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:20,685
That was my son trying to bring
that weak-ass stuff. Come on, baby.

104
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:24,939
Can't try to breeze through the lane.
I need you to be a hurricane. Get low.

105
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,108
[grunts]

106
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:29,193
That's what I'm talking about, boy. Mm.

107
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,446
Yo, you good?

108
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,909
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good. You know me.
[grunts]

109
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,790
I'm gonna get that weak shit out of here.

110
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,376
Better stop that mess.

111
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:46,459
[Vince chuckles]

112
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:54,218
I like what I see out there, T.
You got that rock on a string, baby.

113
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,386
This is Byron.

114
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,138
He's been scouting us from, uh...

115
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,349
- Um...
- Liberty Union Prep.

116
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,518
- There it is.
- Program on the come-up.

117
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,271
Yo, let's get moving.
You've seen enough?

118
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,940
- Let's chop it up.
- Get showered up, son.

119
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,867
[boy 1] That was crazy.
That was a great game.

120
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:22,121
[boy 2] That was crazy. He got right in
the coach's face, that was crazy.

121
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,208
[Vince] This ain't about you,
this is about Riverside.

122
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,003
There are other options for him.

123
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,296
[Nia] What, private?

124
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:33,275
[Vince] He won't be as good at anything
as he could be at this game.

125
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,636
[Nia] He is too smart for you to say
what he could and couldn't be.

126
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,725
[Doug on phone]
<i>We have 500,000 high school players.</i>

[Nia] Oh, you recorded your class.

135
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:18,719
Wow, look at you.
That's good, Terron. That's clever.

136
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,096
[Doug] <i>150,000 are seniors.</i>

137
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,057
[Nia] Are the math rods helping you
comprehend the numbers?

138
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:27,061
- Still ain't making no sense.
- "Isn't" making "any" sense?

139
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,398
- [sighs]
- Come on.

140
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,274
You can do this. You got it.

141
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,783
[Vince]
I ain't talking about walk-around money.

142
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,327
It's gonna cost
to get his ass back and forth.

143
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,456
Yeah. Get back to me with something.

All right.

145
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:53,421
- Who was that?
- Do you like playing on a losing team?

146
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:55,339
No.

147
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:58,634
That ain't gonna be a problem
no more. Your pops is on it.

148
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:01,804
You just gotta keep putting in work,

You look taller in the videos.

164
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,304
Who are you?

165
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:46,348
Coach Gaines. Liberty Prep.

166
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,351
Your dad said I might find you here.

167
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,483
Your team is 0 and 6 this season, huh?

168
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:59,028
That must be frustrating,
as good as you are.

169
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,732
Yeah, it sucks. We're trash.

170
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:06,160
If you were at Liberty,
you'd be 10 and 1.

171
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:09,246
Play twice as many games
with better teammates, better facilities.

172
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:13,042
You'd get to travel around the country.
You ever been to California?

173
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,544
I never been out the state.

174
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:19,924
What?

175
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:25,137
I would have to leave my mom,
my pops, my friends. Everything.

176
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,353
I wanna show you something.

177
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:35,731
You recognize him?

178
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,693
Yeah, he's nice.
You used to coach him or something?

179
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:43,030
Yeah. In fact,
I met him on a court just like this one.

180
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,242
He didn't wanna leave home.

181
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:50,120
But he made the sacrifices he needed to
and now he's an NBA all-star.

182
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:53,541
- Know what else he did to get there?
- Worked hard?

183
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:57,670
No.
He listened to every fucking thing I said.

184
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:00,589
Talent's not enough.
You need someone in your corner

185
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,259
who knows the system
and how to play it for you.

186
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,178
He figured that out
and he has 100 million.

187
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,556
What would you do
with that money, Terron?

188
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,642
I would buy my parents a house.

189
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:15,104
One of those pools that's, like,
shaped like a bean.

190
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:20,234
What are those things in the backyard
where you just like eat and fart?

191
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,321
- A gazebo?
- Yeah, a gazebo.

192
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,907
[chuckling]

193
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:33,080
It's real nice you wanna take care
of your family, Terron. It is.

194
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,793
We both know that's not gonna happen
if you stay here.

195
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,006
Think about it.

196
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,638
Wait, coach.

197
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,560
I wanna make it just like him.
I wanna take care of my family.

198
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:58,981
Good.

199
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,860
Start by giving me 50
behind that crack right there.

200
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,613
All right.
Um, could you count them for me?

201
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,406
You got it. Let's go.

202
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:09,909
That's one.

203
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:11,493
There you go. Nice.

204
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,080
Two.

205
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,668
- [Terron] So, what's the gym like?
- Oh, the gym's real nice.

206
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,629
- You're gonna like it.
- Can't wait.

207
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:26,133
I wanna play basketball forever, coach.
Till I'm, like, your age.

208
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:30,429
- [laughing] That's cold.
- [Vince] My bad for being late.

209
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:35,351
- Did it all go down without me?
- [Gaines] I worked him out pretty hard.

210
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,561
- Nice to meet you, Vince.
- Pretty hard?

211
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,813
- [both chuckle]
- Is he onboard?

212
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:44,360
See? I told you those highlights
would get the word out. Hmm?

213
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,155
Byron and I talked broad strokes,
but we have details to hammer out.

214
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:50,449
[Gaines] Sounds good. Byron's right.
You're tall.

215
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,868
- What are you, 6'4"?
- And a half.

216
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,412
- You were a player, too, right?
- [Vince] Three sports.

217
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,332
Yeah, I was all about football.
Wideout.

218
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:02,378
Well, tight end after I hit my spurt.
I was shorter than him at his age.

219
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:06,048
Man, he's gonna be tall.
His mama's tall, too.

220
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:10,761
- That's good. I can't wait to meet her.
- It's gonna be three on one, right?

221
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:14,264
- Ma won't let me go.
- Don't worry. She's not my first mom.

222
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,308
You ain't her first coach.

223
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,476
[laughing]

224
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,688
All we need is a good game plan.

225
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:23,857
I can set you up,
but you have to knock it down.

226
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:27,695
Because the only person
she can't say no to... is you.

227
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:31,864
You got this?

228
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,870
[Gaines] We're offering your son
a full-ride scholarship,

229
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,414
including room and board.

230
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:41,083
Liberty's never offered this
to someone so young.

231
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,585
That's how much we believe
in his potential.

232
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,213
Your school is called Liberty?
This says it's...

233
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:50,259
Liberty Prep is connected to Bishop
Anthony, an elite country day school

234
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:53,262
that sends its students
to the finest universities.

235
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,139
They prepare him academically,

236
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,391
we prepare for the next level
athletically.

237
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,601
It really is the best of both worlds.

238
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:03,355
So, Liberty is a high school team.
But Terron is only 14.

239
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,982
He's already playing up.

240
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,151
He's gonna live with older students?

241
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,153
[Gaines] He'll live and train
with the team.

242
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:12,156
But he'll study with students his own age
at Bishop Anthony.

243
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:15,117
- [Nia] How far away is this school?
- Just over the state line.

244
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,913
Thanks for the offer.
We'll discuss it as a family.

245
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:23,625
[Gaines] I understand.
Unfortunately, there is a timing element.

246
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,294
I'm on my way to a tournament

247
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,963
and a player is ready to accept
the roster spot.

248
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,049
Nia, we cannot pass this up.

249
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:36,221
Is there anything I can do to help you
feel more comfortable with this decision?

250
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:44,063
If Terron goes to your school, he'd be
one of the smartest kids on your team...

251
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:52,071
but he also has a condition, dyscalculia,
which is a kind of number blindness.

252
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,363
He told me about it.

253
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,700
He did?

254
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,537
Ma, you think things are getting better?

255
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:04,416
They will get better.
We need to work harder.

256
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,876
You think I ain't trying?

257
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:10,506
It's like a... Like another language.
I feel so stupid.

258
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,801
But what else can we do
we ain't been doing?

259
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:19,014
I mean, like, at his school,
they have learning specialists, tutors.

260
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,059
They even got a whole, um...
What is it called?

261
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:26,188
- Learning Differences curriculum.
- Ma, they have a whole program for me.

262
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,524
Please, just let me go get help.

263
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,071
Is this what you really want, our boy?

264
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:41,495
You have to promise me that this is
leading him towards a college education.

265
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:45,499
I'll promise he'll receive multiple
scholarship offers without a doubt.

266
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,001
You have to promise me you're gonna work

267
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,504
just as hard off the court
as you will on it.

268
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:51,713
I promise.

269
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:04,768
Everybody follow me.
I'll follow you guys back.

270
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,397
About to check out the new school.

271
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,275
We doing this live, baby.

272
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,193
Fresh meat.

273
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,321
- [Terron] What's up?
- How you doing?

274
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,782
Coach Curtis. I'll get that for you.
Hop in.

275
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:20,701
[Terron] There it is.

276
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,165
Wasn't that the school?

277
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:29,251
That's Bishop Anthony.
That's where you take classes.

278
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,253
Home is this way.

279
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,312
Welcome to Liberty House.

280
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:12,252
- So, this is where the squad stays?
- Yeah, I know, it's a little rough,

281
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,714
but remember, we're staying at nice hotels
most of the time.

282
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,675
Why don't we just live in the school?

283
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:22,512
Bishop Anthony is a day school,
so no one actually lives there.

284
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,976
- So, who do we play for?
- We play for us.

285
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,979
But it's good for them, too.
It's like a partnership.

286
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:35,067
You know, they get some extra tuition,
make their diversity quota,

287
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,945
and get some real ballers to cheer for.

288
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:42,241
And we get our transcripts and visas
covered and get to use their facilities,

289
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,576
which are nicer than some colleges.

290
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:49,373
You'll see it tomorrow.
You're gonna love it. Trust me. This way.

291
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,168
You just take that top bunk right there.

292
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,593
You need anything at all,
holler at me downstairs.

293
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,471
All right.
Um, do I have to set an alarm?

294
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:08,600
- No, I'll get you up bright and early.
- Wait. Um, what do we have first?

295
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:11,478
First up is the optional-mandatory
workout.

296
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,563
[chuckles] All right.

297
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,326
[Anton] Yo, turn it the fuck off.

298
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:58,817
[sighs]

299
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,079
[Gaines] Good morning.

300
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,419
Here you go, Terron. Good morning.

301
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,051
Sup. My name's T.

302
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:27,054
Yo, coach?

303
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,513
[Gaines] Good morning, Anton.

304
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,974
Got a daycare team
you ain't told us about?

305
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:31,892
[Gaines chuckles]

306
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:33,727
You somebody's son or something?

307
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:35,479
Yeah. Ain't you?

308
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,985
[Anton] Yo, I figured it out.

309
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,403
I know who you are.

310
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:46,073
You're the ball boy.
Why didn't you say so?

311
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,701
- Wait, we got a game tonight?
- Yeah.

312
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:55,207
Yo, y'all met the new ball boy?
He's gonna be carrying your shit.

313
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:26,071
[Curtis] More gifted, more responsibility,
gentlemen.

314
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:30,617
Pain is just the weakness
leaving your body.

315
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,120
Get down in the squat, fresh meat.

316
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,203
[grunting]

317
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:38,667
Fresh meat here is working harder
than all y'all.

318
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,086
Come on, get in there.

319
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:44,297
[whistle blows]

320
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:48,510
Let's go. Pack it in. Hit the shower.
You got second period in 26 minutes.

321
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,847
Petrus. Wrong direction.

322
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,014
[Petrus] My bad, coach.

323
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,016
Class is through there, fresh meat.

324
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:13,702
What time is it?

325
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,111
We are not going to first period.
This was first period.

326
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:26,548
So, then how am I gonna pass...
pre-algebra?

327
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:28,507
Do not worry.

328
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:31,511
You are getting help.
You understand?

329
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,277
[girl 1] Hey, did you see...?

330
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,571
[boy 1] I'm only 70 percent sure
that I got...

331
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:52,282
That I got...
The whole thing was...

332
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:00,707
[boy 2] That test? Dude.
I didn't do the bonus question.

333
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:04,030
You didn't get it? I didn't get it, either, - but I tried my best.
- [boy 1] Yeah.

334
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:08,048
[woman] And everyone open to Psalms 32:34.

335
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,138
[Nia] <i>Where are you, Terron?</i>

336
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:18,475
I'm supposed to be in class,
but I can't find any of them.

337
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:21,436
<i>Well, why don't you ask someone for help,
baby?</i>

338
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:23,063
I don't know anybody.

339
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:26,566
<i>You've gotta make new friends.
You might as well start now.</i>

340
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,859
Yeah.

341
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,486
- Ball boy.
- Yo, Petrus.

342
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,613
Ma, let me call you back.

343
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,491
I need your help finding my classes.

344
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,786
Your next class, second floor,

345
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:41,164
but you don't need to take
this one or that one.

346
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,876
I'm missing one class
because of the workout.

347
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:48,213
If we take test online
or if we turn in paper,

348
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:49,798
the team gets help to pass.

349
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,840
Hmm.

350
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:54,678
We're all in the
Learning Differences curriculum.

351
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:55,761
What?

352
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,222
Oh. [chuckles]

353
00:25:57,305 --> 00:26:01,351
The Learning Differences curriculum.
You don't go to class all the time.

354
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:04,312
You have practices, workouts,
games, travel.

355
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:08,900
We cannot go. Coach, he makes sure
we stay eligible for college.

356
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,485
So, we don't have to worry?

357
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:14,197
We're too big to fail.
Come. Lose to me in <i>2K.</i>

358
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:16,699
Yeah, all right.

359
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,870
But you going down. Watch.

360
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:24,749
[Petrus] Dude. I'm gonna destroy you.
You wanna bet 5 bucks?

361
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,918
- [Terron] What?
- I'm gonna kill you.

362
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,753
- [Terron] I'm taking your money.
- [laughs]

363
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:35,927
Fresh meat.

364
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:38,096
- Oh, nice.
- [Curtis] These your size?

365
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:40,557
No, these are my size.

366
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,352
[all laughing]

367
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:48,648
Yo, coach. Am I starting tonight?

368
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:51,276
You're gonna be starting, little man.

369
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:55,947
Minute after never.
In the month of Nevuary.

370
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,782
Nevuary 32nd.

371
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:01,411
- So, what number you want?
- Um...

372
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:02,828
One?

373
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:04,831
[Anton] Yo.

374
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:10,919
[crowd cheering]

375
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:21,056
Ref, that's more than three seconds.
He's living in that paint. Call that.

376
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:24,476
Forty. Forty. There you go.
Pass it. Pass it.

377
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,439
Fuck. Time-out.
[whistle blows and crowd booing]

378
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:34,110
- Petrus, what the hell was that?
- [Petrus] I was open.

379
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:37,447
- I'm a three-point shooter.
- You're not a three-point maker.

380
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,991
Why do they call me "Microwave"?
I get hot.

381
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,160
They call you Microwave
because you give me cancer.

382
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:44,746
Now, have a seat.
Come on, Forte. You're in.

383
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:46,289
Show us what you got.

384
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,794
Coach, how much time is left?

385
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,213
Two fifty-eight. Let's go.

386
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:58,134
He's not tall, but at least he got
special needs. Good pickup, coach.

387
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,615
[crowd cheering]

388
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:25,703
Terron. You're not in the bush league.
Head up. See the floor.

389
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,499
Screen, screen.
All right, do it, Terron.

390
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,258
You can't switch there. Time-out.

391
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:39,551
[whistle blows]

392
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:46,766
<i>There's a whole new level
of competition here, Terron.</i>

393
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,977
Everyone's seen that eurostep before.

394
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,230
Get used to guys
meeting you above the rim.

395
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:55,692
Come in like you did in the game.
All right? Now, hold up.

396
00:28:56,484 --> 00:29:00,822
See? You give the defender an easy block.
But, you pro-hop to the other side,

397
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,158
use the rim as protection,
finish with the reverse.

398
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:11,833
Good. All right. Now speed it up
and cover more ground.

399
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:17,337
There you go.

400
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:20,967
All right, listen. Daddy's gotta go.
I love you. Okay?

401
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,219
All right, I miss you, too. Good night.

402
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:26,473
You know that move was called a travel
back when I played.

403
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:29,476
Coach, you didn't have
the three-point line when you played.

404
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:34,105
Sure as hell had one when I dropped seven
against Carolina in the '94 tournament.

405
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,107
- For real?
- YouTube that shit.

406
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:38,984
You ever go pro?

407
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,906
Not in the NBA. No speed, no size.

408
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:44,741
Couldn't really play D for shit.

409
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:47,243
Good enough to play
in Latvia for a while.

410
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:51,122
- Where Latvia at?
- Exactly. That's what I said to my agent.

411
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,041
But it was the only offer we got,

412
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:56,503
so I kept playing, saw the world,
had a good run.

413
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:01,090
- Sounds pretty fun to me. I'll play there.
- Yeah.

414
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:03,635
Let's get out
before I get us both in trouble.

415
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:05,261
In trouble for what?

416
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:08,348
Rules say you can only practice
so many hours in a day.

417
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,018
Can I keep playing?
I'm trying to get the move down.

418
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,939
- You know what? You're right. Fuck them.
- [chuckles]

419
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,276
- Let's do the same thing, other side.
- All right.

420
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:24,697
Here. Come on.

421
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,494
Your family live in the house, coach?

422
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:32,288
No, I'm crashing with the team
for a little while.

423
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:37,252
You know, it's tough being a coach's wife,
especially when you have 12 boys.

424
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,505
Damn. You be getting busy, coach.

425
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,299
Oh, oh. You talking about us.

426
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,467
[both laughing]

427
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,886
[Gaines] Yeah. I'm talking about us.

428
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,931
But in the off-season,
the roster's down to two girls.

429
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:53,434
- Maybe you'll meet them.
- Yeah? What they look like? They cute?

430
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,603
Oh, come on, coach.

431
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,146
[both laughing]

432
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,443
[Olembe speaking in foreign language]

433
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,621
[laughing]

434
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:17,208
Nice ringtone, nigga.
Your mother call you?

435
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,213
Do not listen to these two:

436
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,048
Uh... [speaks in foreign language]

437
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,677
They are... What...?
What is your word?

438
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,804
Uh... Douche bags.

439
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:30,972
[all laughing]

440
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:33,808
- Yo, how old are you?
- I'm 18.

441
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,268
[Anton clearing throat]

442
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:39,147
- Cough up that birth certificate.
- Shut up your mouth. Idiot.

443
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,524
[Petrus] Olembe, you were 6
when you were born, no?

444
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:44,944
Hey, yo, special needs.
You almost had a trillion tonight.

445
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:49,866
You know what that is?
One minute and ten zeros.

446
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,242
[both laughing]

447
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,370
[Petrus] Funny. Zero points, zero assists.

448
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,456
Yo, you know how to read
a box score?

449
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,059
Hey, yo, rook. Your job ain't done.

450
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,300
Carry my shit. All season long.

451
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:53,012
- What the fuck did you do with it?
- What are you talking about, bro?

452
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,393
Bro, I will fuck you up, man.

453
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:01,646
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on?
Why aren't you dressed?

454
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:04,941
- This motherfucker took my bag.
- What's he talking about?

455
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:08,695
I don't know. I mean,
I saw one in the back of the van.

456
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,364
It could've been his, coach.

457
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:14,575
The van's in the back of the lot,
so hurry up, Anton.

458
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:23,751
[announcer] And starting at guard,
number zero, Terron Forte.

[crowd booing and cheering]

[all shouting]

461
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,634
- Take care of business. One, two, three.
- [all] Liberty.

462
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,846
Hey. Just run motion. All right?

463
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,514
Show me why I brought you here.

464
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:37,682
Yes, coach.

465
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,113
There we go.

466
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,954
Nice of you to join us, Lyles.

467
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:11,883
Never gonna start, huh?

468
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:23,186
Go, go. Shoot it. Shoot. Shoot.
Terron...

469
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:34,072
[Curtis] Don't let up. Let's go. Let's go.

470
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,198
Forte.

471
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,074
What's wrong?

472
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,368
Is this that numbers thing?

473

[sighs]

474
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,955
I can't read the shot clock.

475
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:47,186
- What did you do at your old school?
- We didn't have a stupid shot clock.

476
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,963
Right. What about at the end of every
quarter? What did you do then?

477
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:55,468
[crowd cheering]

478
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:02,934
Seven, six, five... Go, go, go.

479
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:09,523
[Petrus] Whoo!

480
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:15,279
See that pass?
He's only 14 years old.

481
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,115
[chuckles]

482
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:20,076
Top of that rim, I'm telling you.

483
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,159
Forte.

484
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:24,455
- Yo.
- Next game, we pick and roll, yes?

485
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,541
- Yeah, all right.
- You throw me ally,

486
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,334
I put nuts on their face.

487
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,417
[both laughing]

488
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,940
Yeah, I got you. [Byron] Point guard.

489
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:36,633
What's up, Byron?

490
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:45,560
Good game, champ.
Yo, I got something for you.

491
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:56,237
- Oh, snap.
- You getting upgraded, baby boy.

492
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,240
- You want it?
- Yeah, word.

493
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:02,577
Whatever you need,
you just holla at Uncle B.

494
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,787
- All right.
- All right?

495
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:07,290
- Thanks, Byron.
- All right.

496
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,684
[Gaines] <i>Forte.</i>

497
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:33,399
- Wanna take your game to the next level?
- No doubt.

498
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,985
Good. Then you need to learn
how to run plays.

499
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:38,613
You need to know this offense
inside and out.

500
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:39,989
So, I'm gonna be point?

501
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:41,449
Slow down there, homeboy.

502
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,576
I'm gonna keep you at the two
for now.

503
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:46,662
Gonna have you back up Anton at the one.
He's more of a scoring guard,

504
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:49,957
but he's a senior and he knows
the plays well. All right?

505
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:55,838
You're my point guard of the future.
I'll get you up to speed on the playbook.

506
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,549
- [Anton] Thirty-two.
- Okay. You see what he's doing?

507
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:02,720
- We use numbers for our play calls.
- So, the numbers are like names, right?

508
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:04,055
- [Anton] Hold up.
- Exactly.

509
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:06,891
- Is that gonna be a problem?
- Oh, no. I got it.

510
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:10,144
First number is the play.
Second number is the direction.

511
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,313
Odds to the left, evens to the right.

512
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,690
- So, odds to the...
- Left.

513
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:22,114
Look. Anton, call 47.

514
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:24,075
- Forty-seven.
- See what he's doing?

515
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:26,535
Forty's the play.
And seven's the direction.

516
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:29,455
If it was on the other side, it'd be 48.
You got it?

517
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:33,209
Don't worry.
You'll pick it up quick. Coach?

518
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,799
I want you to bury your nose
in this playbook

519
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:42,260

Rihanna's titties.

[laughing]

521
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,553
[Anton] Forty-eight.

522
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:48,140
- I got you, coach.
- Now, watch this.

523
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:01,487
[Anton] <i>Y'all know why big man</i>
<i>can't hit no threes?</i>

524
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,446
Why's that, man?

525
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,615
Because he's nailing them all day
off the court.

Hey, yo.
I got a question for you, Einstein.

529

It's the number of fucks I give.

530

Bro, I'm being serious.
I wanna know what you're doing.

531
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:23,426
What are these blocks for?
Maybe they could help me?

532
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:28,097
Hey. Don't tell them, but...
[whispers] I got a learning disability.

533
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,183
Something that works for you
could work for me.

534
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:36,856
Well, they just represent numbers.
This represents five, this represents ten.

535
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:39,275
- Yeah.
- So, this is half of that.

536
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:41,277
Oh. I see.

537
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:43,779
You're trying to diagram plays.

538

Dawg, I'm glad you're here.

- [Curtis] Hey, hey.
- [ref] Double foul.

543
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,297
Three black, one white.

544
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:04,925
Use your heads. You can't foul out
in a situation like that.

00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,887
[ref] That's five on number one.
He's gone, coach.

Anton, get your ass up.
Terron, you slide to the one.

00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:15,311
All right, listen up.
We're gonna hold for the last shot.

548
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:17,813
We're gonna run 50.
Terron, it's a tie game.

You be patient, make the read.

00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:22,526
Let's go. Finish on three.
One, two, three.

- You was supposed to...

You go left.
Odds go left, you fucking idiot.

Terron, what the hell was that?

561
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:10,616
- I'm not used to plays with directions.
- Your problem's with numbers.

562
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:13,702
No, it's, like, a visual thing.
Numbers are backwards.

all these years at JuCo.

And the middle school, high school,

720
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:11,425
I learned that these coaches,
these agents,

these motherfuckers wearing those suits,
they are gonna use you.

Hey, Terron. What's up?
What brings you to the presidential suite?

730
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:07,481
Can you hire another assistant coach?

731
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:09,858
Why?

732
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:13,111
Well, my dad, he needs a job.

733
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:19,034
[sighs] Well, look. I don't have
the budget for that. I wish I did.

734
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,370
Well, we got a sponsor now.
Doesn't that help?

735
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:25,081
It helps, but they're just
supplying us product.

736
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:28,919
We don't have their deal.
Hell, he's got four paid assistants.

- Who are they?
- Victory Country Day.

in the finals of the invitational.

741

743
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:47,562

744
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:53,734
Hold on.

745
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,572
You really want him here, huh?

746
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:03,036
You been using that move

What do you got in mind for me, coach?

750
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:12,087
We'll have you work with Byron.

with the right players for next year.

He is the future of this team.

You want me to Uncle up. Got you.

759
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:38,363
Good. Glad to have you onboard, Vince.
I know Terron is, too.

760
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:42,701
- Uh... Who do I talk to about, uh...?
- Byron can handle all that.

761
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:43,784
Thank you.

762
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:50,375
I'll tell you something.
We sucked tonight,

763
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:53,920
but you guys sucked, too.
Both of you. Tell your buddy that.

764
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,088
Listen up.

765
00:52:56,339 --> 00:53:00,176
Listen. You guys like your new sneakers,
new uniforms, all that?

766
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,387
Yeah? Good. You can kiss it goodbye

767
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:05,807
if you let a bunch of scrubs
hang with us. 15 seconds left.

768
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:08,310
Let's finish them off.
And we're running 60.

769
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:12,564
Terron, if we get the mismatch,
hit Petrus down in the post, all right?

770
00:53:12,647 --> 00:53:14,190
- [Terron] Yes, coach.
- [Gaines] Go.

771
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,401
- Come on. Win on three. One, two, three.
- [all] Win.

772
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:17,484
[Anton] Go.

773
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:21,740
Look, I'm just saying, it shouldn't even
come down to this. It's bullshit.

774
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:28,580
[Terron] Sixty-three. Sixty-three.

775
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:38,965
[buzzer buzzing, then crowd cheering]

776
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:41,551
Let's go, boy! Let's get it!

777
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:43,094
Yeah!

778
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:44,512
[yells]

779
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:48,183
Good passing.
That's what I'm talking about.

780
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:50,143
Dumped on him, like boom!

781
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:54,105
Listen to him. Good game, fellas.
T, let me holla at you.

782
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:56,733
Let me holla at you.
Good game.

783
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,945
Good game, but, uh...
why didn't you take that last shot?

784
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:02,405
- What you mean? We won.
- No, listen.

785
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:05,492
We are here to show people you can
show out when the spotlight's on.

786
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,577
That's all them scouts see.

787
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:09,371
You understand?

788
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:11,373
You hear me?

789
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,460
- Good game. Shower up.
- Okay.

790
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:21,800
"The university has shown sincere interest
in you as a prospective student-athlete.

791
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:25,428
We are informing you of our desire
to recruit you

792
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:27,305
to our prestigious university."

793
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:30,392
[chuckles] You know what that means?

794
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:34,062
You are now an official prospect
in the eyes of the NCAA.

795
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:36,564
And you're in the damn eighth grade,
my man.

796
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,108
[chuckles]

797
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,278
- They want me to visit.
- Mm-hm.

798
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,447
- Should I go?
- Hell, no.

799
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:47,534
You're not going to some mid-major.
You kidding me?

800
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:50,829
Listen, Terron, for the next five years,

801
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:53,373
schools are gonna be sending you letters

802
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:58,086
trying to spray and pray, but I wanna
get you offers from the blue bloods.

803
00:54:58,169 --> 00:55:01,214
- Wanna play in the Final Four?
- I wanna win the chip.

804
00:55:01,297 --> 00:55:03,383
Good. Then tune out all that noise.

805
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:07,554
Don't listen to these schools. They
don't have your best interest at heart.

806
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:10,306
In fact, don't listen
to anyone else about this.

807
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:12,642
Not anyone,
you understand what I'm saying?

808
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:16,645
You sure?

809
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:20,066
Yeah, I got... I'm with you, coach.

810
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:24,029
Good. That's why it's important
that I alone

811
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:26,990
handle the recruiting process
from here on out. Okay?

812
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:30,493
Cool. Um, can I keep my first letter?

813
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:32,453
Sure.

814
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:54,434
You know they were recruiting you?

815
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:57,062
Yeah, I knew.
Bro, this close to Signing Day,

816
00:55:57,145 --> 00:56:00,482
do you think I wouldn't know
who was offering me a scholarship?

817
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:03,193
I was just trying to help.

818
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:07,196
Hey, yo.

819
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:09,783
T, look...

820
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:18,541
Yo, for all that shit
that I been talking... [sighs] my bad.

821
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:21,544
For real.
I was just hot because coach...

822
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:24,881
He kicked out my homey
to make room for you.

823
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:28,635
- What? He said there was a open spot.
- They call it "overbooking."

824
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:30,428
Not enough seats on the flight.

825
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:35,058
- So, it's all right I'm running point?
- I'm a scorer, bro.

826
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:37,852
- My averages are up with you feeding me.
- [chuckles]

827
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:41,564
All right. Hey, yo.
Why didn't coach show you those?

828
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:44,859
He don't want me to go to State.
He wants me to go to Tech.

829
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:47,362
- Where you gonna go?
- I'll go to State.

830
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:50,907
It's a better school. I'm tired of
wearing blue. I look better in red.

831
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:52,117
[both laughing]

832
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,827
Yo, good looking out.

833
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:58,400
Wow. I'm really excited to be here, you
know. This has always been a dream of mine.

834
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,794
I'd like to thank my coach
and teammates,

835
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:05,421
because without them,
I wouldn't be here today.

836
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:10,927
But I'm excited to say that in the fall,
I will be attending...

837
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:14,847
Tech.

838
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:16,558
[crowd applauding]

839
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:26,109
[grunting]

840
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:30,071
What happened to looking better in red?

841
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:33,700
Changed my mind.
Get more playing time over at Tech.

842
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:35,994
Coach was pretty into it.

843
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:38,997
Man, he the main one
who wanted me to go to State.

844
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:42,917
Then we get a sponsor
and he talking about Tech, Tech, Tech.

845
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:44,127
Why?

846
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:45,837
Pfft.

847
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:50,425
Bro, they ain't sponsoring us
so we can wear a logo right now.

848
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:54,888
They want coach to steer us to colleges
that are on-brand.

849
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:58,308
That way we on TV repping them
during March Madness, you dig?

850
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:02,645
Hey, come on, man. Push, push.
What you think they paying coach for?

851
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:05,648
I don't know.
He said they was giving him product.

852
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:09,545
He's not gonna be your coach no more,
so why didn't you go to the better school

853
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:12,238
- like you said you was gonna go to?
- I got you.

854
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:14,072
[grunts]

855
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:17,327
Look, we don't play for coach.

856
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:20,121
We don't play for college,
don't play for the NBA,

857
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:23,750
shit, we don't even play for the U.S.
We play for the brands.

858
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:28,880
No, I'm serious. They the ones
that will pay us the most.

859
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:30,589
All right?

860
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,008
All right.

861
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:33,091
All right.

862
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:34,468
Thanks, bro.

863
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:46,940
So, where your pops at?

864
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:50,193
Yo, coach got him on the road,
scouting and stuff.

865
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:52,570
- All right, y'all.
- Wait, where you going?

866
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:55,198
Gotta hit these books.
We got finals coming up.

867
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:58,785
But we have tournament coming up.
We need to get extra shots up.

868
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:03,331
I need my eligibility, I really can't
risk it right now with my offer to Tech.

869
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:05,333
I ain't been to class in a week.

870
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:07,210
- All right, man.
- [Anton] All right, bro.

871
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:13,466
[Nia over phone]
<i>You know, I have to ask, are these real?</i>

872
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:16,719
<i>Did you really get a B on your math quiz?</i>

873
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:19,389
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I got a B.

874
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:38,491
And the sides that make up
and form the right angle

875
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:40,243
are called legs.

876
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:44,706
[Terron] Can I change my class schedule?

877
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:48,376
I can't do class and practice.
I can't do both at the same time.

878
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:50,920
You're in classes
the NCAA says to take

879
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:54,340
to qualify for a scholarship.
And I can't change that, sorry.

880
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:59,429
You can't be missing any workouts
and practices right now, you understand?

881
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:01,347
- Not one.
- Yeah.

882
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:04,726
We got the invitational
in less than a week.

883
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:09,939
[Petrus] Who are we playing
in the tournament?

884
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:11,941
Number one team in the nation.

885
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:13,860
Victory Country Day.

886
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:15,944
Yeah, I know.

887
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:19,824
They got a hell of a lot more talent
than us. They do.

888
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:23,453
We're gonna have to outwork them.
Win every 50-50

889
01:00:23,536 --> 01:00:25,663
and we need to hit the floor hard.

890
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:29,542
[Curtis] Let's go, come on.
I wanna see some hustle, on the whistle.

891
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:30,501
[whistle blows]

892
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:33,129
On the whistle, let's go.
Get it. Get it.

893
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:35,923
Hustle. Come on, now.
Fight for it. Fight for it.

894
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:39,302
That's what I wanna see.
Let's go, Forte. [whistle blows]

895
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:41,512
On the ball. Let's go. Get it.

896
01:00:43,848 --> 01:00:45,558
[Olembe screaming]

897
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:48,269
[Curtis]
Hold on, hold on. You all right, Terron?

898
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:49,437
Come on. Come on.

899
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:51,230
Lem. Lem. Lem.

900
01:00:51,522 --> 01:00:52,815
Lem, calm down.

901
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:54,233
Can you bend it?

902
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:56,402
- I can't, man. I can't.
- Okay.

903
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:03,201
[Gaines] No, this is his coach.
Well, I am his family here.

904
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:05,244
I understand.

905
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:08,915
Coach, is he gonna be okay?

906
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:12,669
He'll be okay.

907
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,692
Well, damn, boy, your ass was out cold.

908
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:38,193
Yeah, I know.

909
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,074
What's all these bags for?

910
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:48,496
Well, this is how I got it figured,
so I know where everything is at.

911
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:50,915
When did you start doing this?

912
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:55,128
I ain't got your mom around
to keep track of my shit so...

913
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:56,587
[knocking on door]

914
01:01:57,171 --> 01:01:58,297
[Gaines] Room service.

915
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:03,553
Good. You got 30 minutes to get in
that meeting room and finish your exam.

916
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:06,723
We'll watch film on Victory
and go over the plan.

917
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:10,518
Uh, I drew up some new plays for my son.
Nobody know his game like me.

918
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:12,437
I'd love to talk to you about it.

919
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:16,190
Let me think about it.
Hustle up, Terron. Let's go.

920
01:02:26,617 --> 01:02:30,955
If you got a travel exception and you're
taking an online equivalent, check it.

921
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:34,333
If your class has a written test,
we have aides here.

922
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:37,503
And if we don't have a key, I can help.

923
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:46,971
[boy 1] Hey.
Who's got the key for pre-calc?

924
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:48,848
[boy 2] A.J. has it next.

925
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:53,269
This all I know.

926
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,400
- [Proctor] You only wrote your name.
- This all I know.

927
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,780
[sighs]

928
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:09,576
[door opens]

929
01:03:19,003 --> 01:03:21,714
It looked like that kid
was feeding them answers.

930
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,800
Some kids need more tutoring
than others.

931
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:26,886
You promised that he was gonna get
a college education.

932
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:29,263
I promised he'd get
a college scholarship,

933
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:31,933
and he's going to.
That is what this is about.

934
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:34,685
[Nia] It's about having a route
to a better opportunity

935
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:36,604
than what we'd be able to afford.

936
01:03:36,687 --> 01:03:39,190
Of course.
Think college will be different?

937
01:03:39,273 --> 01:03:41,502
Terron's gonna have 60 hours a week
of athletic commitments.

938
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:44,111
They'll push him to no-show classes
and if he keeps growing,

939
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:46,280
he won't even be an upperclassman.

940
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:48,324
If he gets a scholarship,
he'll get a degree.

941
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:51,202
Don't even try to tell me
that that's not valuable.

942
01:03:51,285 --> 01:03:53,621
If your son is the player I believe he is,

943
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:56,999
he's gonna be making millions of dollars
while he's a teenager.

944
01:03:57,083 --> 01:04:00,962
Now, I'm sorry, but to me, that's
more valuable than a piece of paper.

945
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:02,588
That's not right.

946
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:07,552
What's not right is he's the reason this
exists and he can't be paid one dollar.

947
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:12,431
TV rights go for billions
on the back of the players.

948
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:16,269
The money he brings in allows for
trust-fund babies to play lacrosse,

949
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:18,062
but he can't see a dime of it?

950
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:21,732
Okay, Terron,
the part that he's leaving out,

951
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:26,612
is what if you don't make it? Then what?
What do you think he's gonna do?

952
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:29,115
He's just gonna move on to the next one.

953
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:32,410
LeBron, Kobe.

954
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:35,204
They all focused on one thing.

955
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:37,582
So did your father.

956
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:11,324
Dang.

957
01:05:17,788 --> 01:05:19,248
[sighs] Wow.

958
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:28,341
Oh, snap. Yo, I know you.

959
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:29,675
- Hey.
- Can we get a pic?

960
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:31,677
Yeah, yeah. I'll take a pic.

961
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,680
- Make me look good in it.
- Got you.

962
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:39,393
- You have a game today?
- I play for the same coach you played for.

963
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:41,771
- Oh, really. Who's that?
- Gaines.

964
01:05:42,563 --> 01:05:45,107
Oh, Coach Gaines.
Yeah, you know what?

965
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:48,611
He knows the game.
I only played with him for a little bit.

966
01:05:48,694 --> 01:05:50,446
- A little bit?
- Yeah. One season.

967
01:05:50,529 --> 01:05:54,158
- Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.
- Yeah, I understand.

968
01:05:54,533 --> 01:05:57,536
I am so glad you're in town for this.
You need tickets?

969
01:05:58,871 --> 01:06:01,540
- How you doing, superstar?
- [man] I'm doing great, man.

970
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:03,000
Hey. Put one of these on.

971
01:06:03,084 --> 01:06:04,710
- For old times' sake.
- [man] Come on.

972
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:07,463
- Come on. You know I keep one.
- [Rob] See? Team spirit.

973
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:08,798
[man] That's nice.

974
01:06:08,881 --> 01:06:10,383
[Rob] I'll see you out there.

975
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:16,097
Terron Forte, the eighth-grader.
Love your motor, young fella.

976
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:17,932
- You've seen me play?
- On video.

977
01:06:18,015 --> 01:06:19,701
- Looking forward to it in person.
- [Vince] Coach.

978
01:06:19,725 --> 01:06:21,268
- Hey, Vince.
- Hey.

979
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:24,689
You got the mixtape. See the real thing.
His game is serious.

980
01:06:24,772 --> 01:06:26,774
- [Rob] That's what I hear.
- [Vince] Good luck.

981
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:36,409
[speaking indistinctly]

982
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:40,621
- Loose ball.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

983
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:42,665
- Loose ball.
- Go, go, go.

984
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:44,458
Yes. Yes.

985
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:45,793
[crowd cheering]

986
01:06:58,347 --> 01:06:59,557
Yeah!

987
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:02,309
Yeah! Come on. Come on.
Come on.

988
01:07:08,733 --> 01:07:09,984
Huddle up. Huddle up.

989
01:07:10,067 --> 01:07:11,694
- You good?
- I'm good, coach.

990
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:14,572
Bro, bro. We up by one.

991
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:17,950
Listen up. We got 11 seconds left,
they got no timeouts.

992
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:21,162
We don't have any fouls left to give.
One thing we know.

993
01:07:21,245 --> 01:07:23,372
Whoever gets that ball
ain't giving it up.

994
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:26,125
Double-team and force them
into a contested shot.

995
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:29,003
- Go. Defense, on three. One, two, three.
- [all] Defense.

996
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:34,800
I got him, I got him.

997
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,184
[buzzer buzzing, then crowd cheering]

998
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:47,438
Fuck, man.

999
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:54,070
Who in their right mind
would wanna do this?

1000
01:07:54,445 --> 01:07:56,238
I hate this job sometimes.

1001
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:59,033
At least we can play
in the consolation bracket.

1002
01:07:59,116 --> 01:08:01,327
That's true. Hey, you know what?

1003
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:03,829
Watching you out there
makes it all worth it.

1004
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:06,624
- Thanks, coach.
- [Rob] Way to keep it close, Jimmy.

1005
01:08:06,707 --> 01:08:10,336
- Terron, you are better in person.
- Stay away from my player, Rob.

1006
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:12,630
Talk to mine.
I got no problem with that.

1007
01:08:12,713 --> 01:08:16,383
- Just get in your van and get out of here.
- Van? We've got a bus.

1008
01:08:16,467 --> 01:08:17,301
[Gaines chuckles]

1009
01:08:17,384 --> 01:08:20,304
Hey, Vince.
There's a proud papa.

1010
01:08:20,387 --> 01:08:21,472
We gotta talk.

1011
01:08:21,555 --> 01:08:22,890
[Vince] What was you thinking?

1012
01:08:22,973 --> 01:08:25,768
- Stay the fuck away from my player!
- Easy, easy.

1013
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:27,978
- The fuck didn't you understand?
- Easy.

1014
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:30,689
- Chill.
- Oh, fuck this.

1015
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:33,692
Should've won that game, man.

1016
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:36,362
- Shot was bullshit.
- [Anton sighs]

1017
01:08:36,737 --> 01:08:38,322
That was the worst shot ever.

1018
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:40,116
[Anton] I don't know, bro.

1019
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:43,827
I'll be back.

1020
01:08:52,878 --> 01:08:56,507
[Gaines] Terron is nationally ranked
because of what I've done for him.

1021
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:06,809
[Gaines] I gave you a job.
This is how you repay me?

1022
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:09,895
[Vince] You ain't using him right.
He's a scorer.

1023
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:13,774
You won't let him get his,
so I found somebody who will.

1024
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:16,527
[Gaines] What are you doing
meeting with him, Vince?

1025
01:09:16,610 --> 01:09:20,614
[Vince] When the number one team comes
calling, I listen to what they gotta say.

1026
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:24,118
Well, whatever that dirt bag
told you is bullshit. Trust me.

1027
01:09:24,201 --> 01:09:25,995
He won't get any playing time.

1028
01:09:26,078 --> 01:09:28,289
It's my son.
I ain't gotta listen to you.

1029
01:09:28,372 --> 01:09:31,167
Actually, you do have to listen to me,
Vince.

1030
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,252
Do you realize how involved you are?

1031
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:35,296
The fuck are you talking about?

1032
01:09:35,379 --> 01:09:39,379
Did you forget we paid you to bring your son here?
Scholarship wasn't enough? You basically sold him.

1033
01:09:41,927 --> 01:09:43,971
[Vince] You were the motherfucker
that paid me.

1034
01:09:44,054 --> 01:09:45,389
[Gaines] No. Byron paid you.

1035
01:09:45,472 --> 01:09:47,808
Money left his account,
ended up in yours.

1036
01:09:47,892 --> 01:09:52,354
So, all your travel expenses, the receipts
for Terron's phone and his jewelry?

1037
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:55,858
You know what, Vince?
It's all improper benefits, all illegal.

1038
01:09:55,941 --> 01:09:58,152
You try to move your son
from my program,

1039
01:09:58,235 --> 01:10:02,198
- I'll make sure Byron tells everything.
- Think I give a fuck about that?

1040
01:10:02,823 --> 01:10:08,495
You should, Vince. Once it's out he's been
paid to play, he's no longer an amateur.

1041
01:10:09,788 --> 01:10:13,083
So, he's not going anywhere.
But you're done here.

1042
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:17,379
[Vince] You think after this, I'm gonna
keep him playing for your ass?

1043
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:20,132
[Gaines] Don't get in the way
of what we build.

1044
01:10:20,799 --> 01:10:22,176
[sighs]

1045
01:10:28,682 --> 01:10:30,601
[line rings]

1046
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:34,897
[Nia]<i> Hey, I'm in the stands.</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>

1047
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:38,567
I'm downstairs. I think
I just did something really stupid.

1048
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:40,527
<i>- I'll be right there.</i>
- All right.

1049
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:47,868
[sighs]

1050
01:11:25,572 --> 01:11:26,572
Come on.

1051
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:32,371
- Let's go, son.
- Why are you trying to fuck everything up?

1052
01:11:33,247 --> 01:11:36,208
- Excuse you?
- Go. Just go.

1053
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:37,501
Boy, I will f...

1054
01:11:45,759 --> 01:11:49,179
- I'm sorry that...
- You trying to take the game away from me?

1055
01:11:49,263 --> 01:11:50,931
No. No, I would never do that.

1056
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:56,520
- How much did you hear?
- I heard everything.

1057
01:11:57,813 --> 01:11:58,814
[Gaines sighs]

1058
01:11:58,897 --> 01:12:02,651
- I'm sorry. Let's forget this happened.
- We can't. I recorded it all.

1059
01:12:03,193 --> 01:12:04,403
You recorded it?

1060
01:12:06,196 --> 01:12:07,197
Well, delete it.

1061
01:12:08,115 --> 01:12:10,868
I did. But it was live,
so it already got views.

1062
01:12:12,953 --> 01:12:15,122
Jesus, Terron.
You shouldn't have done that.

1063
01:12:15,205 --> 01:12:17,458
Recruiting violations
hurt the player most.

1064
01:12:17,541 --> 01:12:19,460
If that gets out, that'd be bad.

1065
01:12:19,918 --> 01:12:22,004
You could lose your eligibility to play.

1066
01:12:22,963 --> 01:12:25,382
You'll be off the team
and I could be out of coaching.

1067
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:29,845
If anybody saved that,
you don't know how fucked we are.

1068
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:32,598
[Gaines sighs]

1069
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:34,558
Oh, damn.

1070
01:12:38,270 --> 01:12:39,938
Hey. What happened?

1071
01:12:41,231 --> 01:12:42,231
I don't know.

1072
01:12:53,077 --> 01:12:56,789
<i>Yeah, well, whatever that dirt bag
told you is bullshit, trust me.</i>

1073
01:12:56,872 --> 01:13:00,084
<i>- He won't get playing time.
- I ain't gotta listen to you.</i>

1074
01:13:00,167 --> 01:13:01,919
<i>You do have to listen to me, Vince.</i>

1075
01:13:02,836 --> 01:13:04,505
<i>You realize how involved you are?</i>

1076
01:13:04,588 --> 01:13:07,257
<i>Did you forget that we paid you money
to bring your son here?</i>

1077
01:13:07,341 --> 01:13:08,550
<i>Did you forget that?</i>

1078
01:13:08,634 --> 01:13:13,347
<i>Byron paid you. Money left his
bank account, ended up in yours.</i>

1079
01:13:13,931 --> 01:13:16,683
<i>Scholarship wasn't enough?
You basically sold him.</i>

1080
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:18,519
<i>You were the mother****** that paid me.</i>

1081
01:13:18,602 --> 01:13:21,730
<i>- Think I give a fuck about that?
- You should, Vince.</i>

1082
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:25,692
<i>Once it's out he's been paid to play,
he's no longer an amateur.</i>

1083
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:37,079
[Doug] So, the idea with any equation
in algebra is the idea of equality.

1084
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:39,164
It's why it's called an equation.

1085
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:41,048
Whatever happens on one side
of the equal sign

1086
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:42,709
has to happen on the other.

1087
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:45,421
[crowd cheering]

1088
01:14:20,747 --> 01:14:23,959
Well, I ain't on the court either,
so that makes two of us.

1089
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:27,588
Yo, bro. You gonna be all right?

1090
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:32,092
<i>They say yes,
but I have no health insurance.</i>

1091
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:36,513
- So, then, what can you do?
<i>- Time to get job.</i>

1092
01:14:36,597 --> 01:14:40,017
<i>I not gonna pretend I'm student no more.
I'm 24 years old.</i>

1093
01:14:41,101 --> 01:14:43,812
Twenty-four years old? I knew it.

1094
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:51,153
<i>Hey. We no have no birth certificate,
so I say I'm 18 so I get student visa.</i>

1095
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:57,075
- So, then what are you gonna do now?
<i>- When I recover, I play international.</i>

1096
01:14:59,536 --> 01:15:04,750
<i>To Latvia. I no know it,
but I ask coach, he found me team.</i>

1097
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:06,667
Hmm.

1098
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:09,963
<i>So, what about you, Terron?
What are you going to do?</i>

1099
01:15:24,811 --> 01:15:27,147
- What you got there, boy?
- Bills.

1100
01:15:28,607 --> 01:15:29,607
Give them here.

1101
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:31,652
Boy, stop playing.

1102
01:15:32,611 --> 01:15:35,614
What you gonna do?
You can't even pay them right now.

1103
01:15:36,782 --> 01:15:38,158
You gonna sell me again?

1104
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:48,168
Never even got a dollar for playing.

1105
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:50,963
Even for all of this.

1106
01:15:55,509 --> 01:15:57,886
That's why I did what I did, boy.

1107
01:15:59,137 --> 01:16:01,306
Just trying to take care of this family.

1108
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:05,936
You understand?

1109
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:29,084
So, Ma. How much this cost?

1110
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:32,254
- What?
- The house.

1111
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:36,216
Well, that's not something
for you to worry about.

1112
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,594
I'm trying to work something out.
Come on.

1113
01:16:38,927 --> 01:16:39,928
[chuckles]

1114
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:42,764
Ma, it's a math problem. Come on.

1115
01:16:45,058 --> 01:16:47,603
How much should I put in
for my college amount?

1116
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:49,896
Well, you could still go on scholarship.

1117
01:16:50,897 --> 01:16:54,776
Yeah, I just put in the same
as your loans, but what about Dad?

1118
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:55,861
[Nia] What about him?

1119
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:59,197
[Terron] Prescriptions and stuff.
How much do they cost?

1120
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:02,367
[Nia] Well, that depends on
if you have insurance...

1121
01:17:02,909 --> 01:17:03,994
Yeah, true.

1122
01:17:05,912 --> 01:17:06,955
But we don't.

1123
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:09,916
So, we need money for that,
on top of all this.

1124
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:27,643
I don't know, Ma.
It's not making any sense.

1125
01:17:27,726 --> 01:17:30,062
Like, the numbers aren't making any sense.

1126
01:17:31,146 --> 01:17:34,691
Well, why did you record that class
on your phone?

1127
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:38,028
How'd you get the direction
of your play calls right?

1128
01:17:39,279 --> 01:17:42,658
I don't know. I guess I just find a way
to work around things.

1129
01:17:44,242 --> 01:17:47,245
Well, what can we use
to work around these things?

1130
01:17:47,746 --> 01:17:48,955
College.

1131
01:17:51,124 --> 01:17:52,501
Coach.

1132
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:55,879
The brand.

1133
01:17:58,340 --> 01:17:59,466
Gaines.

1134
01:17:59,549 --> 01:18:00,759
Coach Gaines.

1135
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:21,822
[Gaines] Motherfucker.

1136
01:18:21,905 --> 01:18:23,323
[Gaines groans]

1137
01:18:29,913 --> 01:18:31,665
What are you doing here, Terron?

1138
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:34,793
You were right.

1139
01:18:35,293 --> 01:18:38,380
I lost my eligibility,
so now I can't even play for my old team.

1140
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:41,466
But people are saying
you paid players before.

1141
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:43,844
This isn't the first time. Is that true?

1142
01:18:44,302 --> 01:18:45,345
Yeah, it's true.

1143
01:18:46,179 --> 01:18:50,183
You have to. You can't compete in
this game if you don't do that, Terron.

1144
01:18:52,686 --> 01:18:56,732
I wish these fuckers making the rules
would come meet you and your family.

1145
01:18:57,774 --> 01:19:00,527
And then try to tell me
I shouldn't help you out.

1146
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:04,030
The thing's rigged against
the people it should be helping.

1147
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:07,409
You didn't have to be like that
with my dad, though.

1148
01:19:07,784 --> 01:19:08,952
I'm sorry about that.

1149
01:19:10,078 --> 01:19:12,372
No way I'd let you play for that scumbag.

1150
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:15,959
- They call him Coach Midnight.
- Why do they call him that?

1151
01:19:16,042 --> 01:19:19,004
He steals people's players
in the middle of the night.

1152
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:21,757
- Ain't that what you did with me?
- No.

1153
01:19:22,299 --> 01:19:25,218
I met you at a reasonable hour.
It was, like, 8 p.m.

1154
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:29,473
So, in that case, I guess
you're like Coach Dinnertime.

1155
01:19:29,848 --> 01:19:31,516
[both laughing]

1156
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,018
Yeah, I guess.

1157
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:35,896
Well, I'm not Coach Anything
at the moment, am I?

1158
01:19:41,735 --> 01:19:44,654
I'm sorry you had to lose your job
like that, coach.

1159
01:19:46,114 --> 01:19:51,203
- At least you're here with the fam, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah, it's great. It's great.

1160
01:19:51,286 --> 01:19:54,539
How's school? I hear Liberty's
playing you guys pretty soon.

1161
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:57,501
- They gonna let you on the court?
- No.

1162
01:19:58,251 --> 01:20:01,213
- They gonna let you coach?
- Nobody would touch me now.

1163
01:20:03,089 --> 01:20:05,008
That means you need a job, right?

1164
01:20:05,091 --> 01:20:06,092
[chuckles]

1165
01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:08,136
You got something?

1166
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:15,309
What?

1167
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:19,522
What?

1168
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:23,193
<i>What's up,
I know I haven't posted in a minute.</i>

1169
01:20:23,276 --> 01:20:25,320
<i>I'm on my way to a meeting right now.</i>

1170
01:20:26,696 --> 01:20:29,491
<i>Gonna talk about my idea,
somewhere, all the way up there.</i>

1171
01:20:29,574 --> 01:20:33,787
<i>On my way to meet with my coach. He got
a few people with me to connect with.</i>

1172
01:20:33,870 --> 01:20:37,290
<i>I don't know if it's gonna work.
Trying to connect the pieces.</i>

1173
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:41,962
<i>Been taking a bunch more meetings.
So, I guess my idea's not crazy.</i>

1174
01:20:42,629 --> 01:20:44,798
<i>I can't tell you guys
anything about it.</i>

1175
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:50,720
<i>That's all y'all can see now.
But you guys will see in the future.</i>

1176
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:55,016
<i>The Liberty boys pulling up.</i>

1177
01:20:55,308 --> 01:20:58,979
<i>Long time in the van.
Haven't seen these guys in a minute.</i>

1178
01:20:59,062 --> 01:21:01,606
<i>Ah, Coach Curtis. </i>[chuckles]

1179
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:03,900
<i>Are you serious?</i>

1180
01:21:05,193 --> 01:21:08,989
<i>Terron, didn't you learn your lesson?
You might wanna turn that thing off.</i>

1181
01:21:09,489 --> 01:21:11,116
[Terron] <i>Hey, yeah, you right, coach.</i>

1182
01:21:12,826 --> 01:21:15,203
Hey, T. It's crazy in there.

1183
01:21:15,287 --> 01:21:17,789
Everybody wants to see you play
your old team.

1184
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:22,878
Oh, coach. You got my old jersey, right?

1185
01:21:22,961 --> 01:21:25,672
I know you wanna play,
but you can't with the investigation.

1186
01:21:25,755 --> 01:21:29,509
You gotta let me play Liberty.
I got a plan. The team is onboard.

1187
01:21:30,427 --> 01:21:33,805
- I'm not gonna like this, am I?
- We're never gonna beat them.

1188
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:36,433
If I play, the forfeit
counts as a loss, right?

1189
01:21:36,516 --> 01:21:38,560
So, if we're gonna lose, let me play.

1190
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:42,230
Have my jersey ready.
I gotta take care of something.

1191
01:21:48,862 --> 01:21:51,031
Oh, there you are. Let's go.

1192
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:55,076
Come on.

1193
01:21:58,038 --> 01:22:00,916
- Yo, what the fuck is he doing here?
- [Terron] Dad, chill.

1194
01:22:00,999 --> 01:22:03,251
- Terron.
- Ma, trust me. Come on.

1195
01:22:04,711 --> 01:22:05,711
Coach.

1196
01:22:06,046 --> 01:22:08,131
[Gaines] Listen, Vince, Nia.

1197
01:22:08,214 --> 01:22:10,884
I know I'm the last person
you expected to see,

1198
01:22:10,967 --> 01:22:14,137
but I'm here because your son
is about to change the game.

1199
01:22:14,304 --> 01:22:17,098
Why don't you explain it to them.
It was your idea.

1200
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:18,892
I'm giving up my amateur status,

1201
01:22:19,684 --> 01:22:22,062
renouncing my high school
and college eligibility.

1202
01:22:22,145 --> 01:22:24,648
Coach is gonna be my agent,
we're doing an endorsement deal.

1203
01:22:24,731 --> 01:22:26,816
- I'm going pro.
- Say what?

1204
01:22:27,484 --> 01:22:29,653
Terron, if he's pushing you,
you don't...

1205
01:22:29,736 --> 01:22:34,324
- No, Ma. This is my plan. All my plan.
- Has anyone ever done this before?

1206
01:22:34,407 --> 01:22:37,994
They do it in tennis, golf and gymnastics,
but not basketball.

1207
01:22:38,578 --> 01:22:41,456
Terron's gonna be the first one
to do it in the U.S.

1208
01:22:41,539 --> 01:22:44,960
- The first.
- But where has anyone gone pro at his age?

1209
01:22:45,043 --> 01:22:47,879
Overseas.
Players like Ricky Rubio and Tony Parker

1210
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:51,091
signed their first contracts
when they were Terron's age.

1211
01:22:51,174 --> 01:22:54,594
- That's why I'm going international, Ma.
- Whoa, whoa, overseas?

1212
01:22:54,678 --> 01:22:57,973
Other countries don't have
the same restrictions we do here.

1213
01:22:58,056 --> 01:23:00,725
And that allows the players
to work year-round

1214
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:05,105
and get paid, instead of limiting training
by making them play for free.

1215
01:23:05,188 --> 01:23:09,526
We wanna take that advantage to Terron
when he's old enough to play in the NBA.

1216
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:11,194
Show them the deal, coach.

1217
01:23:11,277 --> 01:23:14,155
Ma, the brands even had
a bidding war. That's crazy.

1218
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:17,575
It's true.
We received multiple endorsement offers.

1219
01:23:17,659 --> 01:23:22,163
But this is by far the best one.
It's a multi-year deal, as you can see,

1220
01:23:22,247 --> 01:23:24,791
it comes with a significant signing bonus.

1221
01:23:24,874 --> 01:23:27,669
- They've even got this for us.
- [chuckles] It's true.

1222
01:23:27,752 --> 01:23:31,840
They wanna fly us to their headquarters
to make the presentation face-to-face.

1223
01:23:32,799 --> 01:23:36,678
They see your son as a potential
superstar, and not just on the court.

1224
01:23:36,761 --> 01:23:41,516
No, they are eager to tap into his
growing social-media presence as well.

1225
01:23:41,599 --> 01:23:44,853
- Why the fuck should we trust you?
- Dad. It's not like that.

1226
01:23:44,936 --> 01:23:48,023
Listen, I know I've made some mistakes.
I own that.

1227
01:23:48,106 --> 01:23:52,318
But I've always done what I thought
is best for Terron, and that stands here.

1228
01:23:54,154 --> 01:23:56,948
- Where's my son gonna live?
- Dad, what do you mean?

1229
01:23:57,032 --> 01:23:59,784
I'm doing this so we can stay together.
All of us.

1230
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:02,454
- Then what about school?
- [Terron] You can do that.

1231
01:24:02,537 --> 01:24:04,706
You're the best teacher in the world.
Homeschool me.

1232
01:24:04,789 --> 01:24:09,627
You wouldn't even have to work, Ma.
And neither do you, Dad. I got us.

1233
01:24:11,087 --> 01:24:14,966
- T, what if you get hurt?
- I thought about that already.

1234
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:17,927
- Tell them about the insurance.
- When he signs a pro contract,

1235
01:24:18,011 --> 01:24:20,055
we take out an insurance policy.

1236
01:24:20,138 --> 01:24:22,474
If he gets injured or anything happens...

1237
01:24:22,557 --> 01:24:24,934
The family's taken care of.
Now do you see?

1238
01:24:29,272 --> 01:24:30,315
Is it enough?

1239
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:32,149
Uh...

1240
01:24:32,525 --> 01:24:34,778
Baby, it's more than enough.

1241
01:24:35,945 --> 01:24:38,990
[Terron] Okay, good.
We can take a trip together.

1242
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:42,285
You look through all the numbers.
I got a game to play.

1243

[crowd cheering]

1244
01:25:35,004 --> 01:25:37,006
There's a problem with your plan.

1245
01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:40,718
If you play, it's not an official game.

1246
01:25:40,802 --> 01:25:43,680
I was set to forfeit
so you could be out there,

1247
01:25:43,763 --> 01:25:46,850
but they won't let me use the gym
for a non-official game.

1248
01:25:48,476 --> 01:25:50,395
- More red tape.
- More red tape.

1249
01:25:53,439 --> 01:25:54,440
I got this.

1250
01:26:08,538 --> 01:26:10,874
Um, so, I can't play tonight...

[crowd booing]

1252
01:26:19,090 --> 01:26:23,011

that I'm ineligible to play, so...

[crowd booing]

1254
01:26:31,394 --> 01:26:32,937

Refs, y'all can go home,
turn off the scoreboard,

1257
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:49,579
because we can't play in here.
But what we can do...

1258
01:26:49,662 --> 01:26:52,540
We can play out there, right?
Let's go play.
