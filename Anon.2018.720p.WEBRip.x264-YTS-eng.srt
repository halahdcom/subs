1
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,125
Did you get lucky last night?

2
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,666
Of course. Did you?

3
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,750
I am an open window.

4
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,625
Over infinity.

5
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:03,250
A whole new world on your wrist.

6
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:06,083
I am Giguere de Corto.

7
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,750
It's my son.

8
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,166
He hasn't returned my calls.

9
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,625
It's not like him.

10
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,541
You know what happened?

11
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,708
Detected in the Ether an hour ago.

12
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,125
You sure you want to see?

13
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:37,583
Yes.

14
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:40,833
I want to.

15
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,458
Step back... Step ba...

16
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,416
I know where I left it.

17
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,916
You can see in my record.

18
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,625
I left it in the hotel bathroom.

19
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,083
Show me the maid.

20
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,125
Can't help you.

21
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:03,958
Well someone else came in.
It didn't just walk out on its own.

22
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:05,791
Wish I could.

23
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,750
We're leaving.

24
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:20,041
You didn't show her what happened
a minute earlier.

25
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,416
Or what happened four hours later

26
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,375
when she sold the bracelet
to pay rent.

27
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,958
There was just something about that woman
that annoyed the fuck out of me.

28
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,791
At this moment,
my client feared for his life.

29
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:44,541
Don't do it.

30
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,458
I haven't done anything.

31
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,958
He had a split-second to defend himself.

32
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,000
There was no way to know
he wasn't reaching for a gun.

33
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,708
You can see from the infant's
point of view

34
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:16,666
my client cooperated fully
with authorities.

35
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:34,208
It's what he was doing an hour earlier
that concerns me,

36
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,500
and perhaps, a jury.

37
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,875
Your client's judgment was
severely impaired.

38
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,416
Let's discuss a plea agreement.

39
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:58,666
- Sir, there's...
- I see it.

40
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,125
Charlie, how are the girls?

41
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,708
Still spending money like I got it.

42
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:25,625
James Cray.

43
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,541
Shot between the eyes.

44
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:31,000
- An hour ago and change.
- Why is there a block on his record?

45
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:34,875
Charlie.

46
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,625
When do we know who shot him?

47
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,708
Take a look how it ends.

48
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:48,791
You're cleared.

49
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,291
He enters his apartment.

50
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,250
Five minutes later,
he's checking stock prices.

51
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:11,500
- That's when it gets interesting.
- Did I say I wasn't interested?

52
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,083
Shit.

53
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,458
Who are you?

54
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,250
He sees what the killer sees.

55
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,083
To hide himself.

56
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:38,041
The killers hacks
into Cray's Mind's Eye.

57
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,166
- Cray's point of view...
- What are you doing?

58
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,833
...now the killer's point of view.

59
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,416
He's looking at himself.

60
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,666
Before Cray could make sense of it...

61
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,625
Please, don't.

62
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:51,666
Please.

63
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,875
Who could hack a human being?

64
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:02,958
It gets better.

65
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,208
As in worse?

66
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,375
Look at the metadata time of death.

67
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:11,833
Timeline ends at 1810 and 24 seconds.

68
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:17,791
Jesus.

69
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:21,791
Not just the identity-theft
to hack the man's eye,

70
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,291
the victim's alone
when he's killed.

71
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,708
Or that's what it looks like.

72
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,083
Shooter has no signature.

73
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,875
No identifying meta trail.

74
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:35,500
What's the world coming to when
murderers won't tell us who they are?

75
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:42,208
Makes a change from picking up crazies
we already know are guilty.

76
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,625
We actually got ourselves a whodunit.

77
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,166
Two.

78
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,208
Matches another case.

79
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:56,250
Baltimore, July, also got his POV hacked,
also by a shooter who wasn't there.

80
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:07,625
What's happening?

81
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:11,416
What is this?

82
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:18,583
They thought it was an anomaly,
but now they want to reopen the case.

83
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:21,916
Last visitor
was of the female persuasion.

84
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,625
- The woman's ID?
- Scrubbed.

85
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,875
By the by, this doesn't get out.

86
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,375
Let the press gossip.
Officially, it's a suicide.

87
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:34,375
Charlie, this morning downtown...

88
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:36,875
I saw a ghost.

89
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:38,458
Face without a name?

90
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,541
Girl was a blank slate,
no digital footprint.

91
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,333
Thought maybe it was a glitch,
ran her again, nothing.

92
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:46,500
Another cipher.

93
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,333
Seeing too many.

94
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,333
Or not seeing.

95
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,875
- Send her to me.
- You got it.

96
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,708
You with me, Sal?

97
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,208
Yeah, of course we are.

98
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:52,375
Damn.

99
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,375
Oh, Jesus.

100
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:57,458
I'm out of here.

101
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,666
What were you watching?

102
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,875
Show me what you were watching right now

103
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,791
or you're never going to see me again.

104
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,291
Show me, Sal.

105
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:12,458
I can't.

106
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,125
No.

107
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,666
I really can't.

108
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,333
So what are we looking at, Lester?

109
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,666
We analyzed the victim's record.

110
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,000
A week ago, an edit.

111
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,958
Technically, it's a duplication.

112
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:11,166
This footage has been rock and rolled.
To stretch it...

113
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,500
and if you analyze it carefully...

114
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,958
we'll see he spends too long on
several pages in the book.

115
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,458
Other anomalies with this footage...

116
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,875
you compare stock activity
in his Mind's Eye

117
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,375
with what actually happened to the market
on the day.

118
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,333
It's been elongated too, but...

119
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:33,125
unless you're looking for it,
you would never see it.

120
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,208
This is very good, so...

121
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:40,000
meticulous fucking work.

122
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,583
But it all masked deleted activity.

123
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:45,500
Illegal activity that the SEC missed.

124
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:49,458
A day later, he's cleared
of an insider trading charge.

125
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:52,416
Then there's this.

126
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:59,208
It's kind of hard to hear with the music
playing in his head, but...

127
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,291
that.

128
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,500
- That's a doorbell.
- Cray had a mystery guest.

129
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,541
They covered their tracks,
no evidence of the meeting.

130
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,666
There was nothing
in the victim's background

131
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:17,583
to suggest he had the ability
to launder his own record, so...

132
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:18,833
Hacker for hire.

133
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:23,375
Jordan Nees, has edits too.

134
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,875
Music producer with a history
of heroin addiction.

135
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,958
Had his latest relapse scrubbed.

136
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,166
So he wouldn't lose his job.

137
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:33,875
This is a nightmare.

138
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:38,750
The hypothetical... isn't.

139
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,833
Not only can they get into the house,

140
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,791
they're moving the furniture around.

141
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:48,458
Charlie, you know that girl I saw
yesterday on South William.

142
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:52,666
She matches the description of the last
person to see Nees alive.

143
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,708
Last night, she got deleted
from my history.

144
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:01,125
Thought it might be something in
the Ether, but nothing else is missing.

145
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:05,666
Now, I'm thinking that someone got
into my life record and erased her.

146
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:09,791
Send her back to me.

147
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,833
I was going to ask you the same thing.

148
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:15,916
Mine's gone.

149
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:07,916
The moment I saw her...

150
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:11,458
now just a black hole.

151
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,250
Not just me.

152
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,625
Ten other people in the street that day
now have edits in their record.

153
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,958
The moments they looked at her...

154
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,291
random strangers.

155
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,166
She must have built an algorithm.

156
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:31,458
Automatically searches for her
and erases any trace it finds.

157
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,791
Blacks her out and leaves a gap.

158
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,250
None of the people in the street

159
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:43,000
significant enough in their life
to warrant a proper cover-up.

160
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,708
And anyone who is significant
has a nasty habit of dying.

161
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:50,250
Hard to erase their memories
without erasing them.

162
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,916
Handful of people smart enough
to do this.

163
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,708
Generally too smart
to go on a killing spree.

164
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:58,041
Unless the gifted mind is a sick one.

165
00:18:58,333 --> 00:18:59,958
They do a surveillance search?

166
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,916
With what? We don't have a face anymore.

167
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,291
Fuck.

168
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,291
We don't have a name, a face...

169
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:08,916
no idea where she is.

170
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,500
Yeah.

171
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,125
We got exactly nothing.

172
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:19,583
Hungry?

173
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,083
I'm good.

174
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,083
You have arrived.

175
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:32,541
Hey.

176
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:34,875
Hi, Sal.

177
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,958
- It's late.
- I know.

178
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,916
Tomorrow's his birthday.

179
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,458
You think I don't know that?

180
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,166
Ten.

181
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:47,166
Please stop. He's gone.

182
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,500
He would have been ten.

183
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:54,375
You got to stop doing this,
to yourself and to me.

184
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,333
Doing what?

185
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,291
I'm keeping his memory alive.
What's wrong with that?

186
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,458
The memory's not going anywhere.

187
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,458
By the looks of it, neither are you.

188
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:04,666
Sal.

189
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:08,375
Does he have to be on the call
every time we talk?

190
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,083
Conrad, I'm not going to keep her long,
it's just..

191
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:13,250
I know...

192
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:16,041
but you can't keep calling all hours.

193
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:17,791
She's not your wife anymore.

194
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:20,708
It's his fucking birthday.

195
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,500
Kristen.

196
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Are you drunk?

197
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:29,958
You're swaying.

198
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:31,666
Not fucking drunk.

199
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,875
I'm tired. I've been working...
I haven't had a drink for days.

200
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:39,750
Show me the last ten minutes
of your record.

201
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:41,916
You know what?

202
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:43,833
I've got to go.

203
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Help!

204
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:35,958
Please, kill me.

205
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:37,666
Don't hurt her, please.

206
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:40,833
Don't, please.

207
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:42,958
No!

208
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,625
Mind's Eye hijacked.

209
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:57,541
Both of them.

210
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:01,000
The thing is, sir, the perp's POV...

211
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:04,125
I can't identify it.
It's got no signature.

212
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:05,583
No shit.

213
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:09,250
First responder.

214
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:11,875
I was in the neighborhood, sir.

215
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:13,291
Where is everyone?

216
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:15,166
On their way.

217
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:17,083
Who else is here?

218
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:18,916
Housekeeper.

219
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:21,000
She was downstairs.

220
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,166
She's back in her room.

221
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,291
She's a mess.

222
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,708
I spoke to her.

223
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:56,375
Ma'am, can you describe the visitor?

224
00:23:57,958 --> 00:23:59,791
Long, brown hair...

225
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:00,875
Twenty-five?

226
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:02,958
I only saw her for a second.

227
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,208
Just us and her in the house now?

228
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,500
That's one hell of a rat.

229
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:14,958
There's four of us in the house.

230
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,791
One of us is being shy.

231
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:20,916
Jam your transmitter.

232
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:09,250
Ah, fuck.

233
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,708
Please, kill me.

234
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Don't hurt her, please.

235
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:19,625
Don't, please.

236
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:21,875
No!

237
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:32,166
Lesbian couple.

238
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,791
Neither was out.

239
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:34,708
One...

240
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:38,666
daughter of a prominent Christian right
senator up for re-election.

241
00:26:38,916 --> 00:26:40,166
In the last week,

242
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:44,083
the women had themselves removed
from each other's lives.

243
00:26:44,375 --> 00:26:45,500
For appearances,

244
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:47,375
no easy task.

245
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:49,375
Dating for a year.

246
00:26:51,041 --> 00:26:53,458
We're starting to get a picture
of our hacker

247
00:26:53,541 --> 00:26:55,750
even though we don't have
a fucking picture.

248
00:26:56,666 --> 00:26:58,000
Lives in the Ether.

249
00:26:58,875 --> 00:27:01,166
Makes her living covering up sub-crime

250
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:04,500
not detected automatically.
Secrets, affairs,

251
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:08,000
non-violent white-collar so-called
"victimless crime."

252
00:27:08,916 --> 00:27:12,708
She's a master editor who cuts together
a believable alibi

253
00:27:12,791 --> 00:27:14,833
to replace the unwanted act
in the record.

254
00:27:14,916 --> 00:27:17,583
Most of all, she erases herself.

255
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:20,125
And now, her clients are getting erased.

256
00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:22,875
Why bother to meet the client?

257
00:27:24,041 --> 00:27:25,208
If she can do it remote.

258
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:29,166
She doesn't want a lot of back-and-forth
communication, leave a trail,

259
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:30,625
get intercepted.

260
00:27:30,708 --> 00:27:33,708
Wants to be paid in the only
currency that can't be hacked. Cash.

261
00:27:33,791 --> 00:27:34,791
Remember cash?

262
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:38,416
And here I was thinking
she was all about the personal touch.

263
00:27:38,541 --> 00:27:41,833
She might be. Trace markers
are unregistered, but match.

264
00:27:41,916 --> 00:27:44,583
Suggests she might have been intimate
with her victims.

265
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,375
Is that what this is?

266
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:48,875
No one gets to kiss and tell?

267
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:50,666
Wouldn't be the first.

268
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:54,541
Seems like every customer she takes
to bed ends up DOA.

269
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:58,166
And this girl has more than one way
to kill you.

270
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,750
Last night, when I was chasing her...

271
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:13,416
...that's where it starts.

272
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:15,916
She changes what I see.

273
00:28:16,791 --> 00:28:17,791
The stairs...

274
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:20,291
the stretch.

275
00:28:21,416 --> 00:28:22,708
They look normal.

276
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:26,166
Not to me. It's an optical illusion.

277
00:28:26,708 --> 00:28:30,416
Which later disappears from my record.
And it doesn't end there.

278
00:28:31,708 --> 00:28:32,708
At this moment...

279
00:28:34,416 --> 00:28:35,458
I'm seeing...

280
00:28:36,041 --> 00:28:38,000
a train at the platform.

281
00:28:40,875 --> 00:28:42,416
A train that isn't there.

282
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,125
I swear to God.

283
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,666
Real one could have killed me.

284
00:28:58,875 --> 00:29:00,250
Placing a moving image...

285
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:03,333
over a record in real time...

286
00:29:05,916 --> 00:29:06,916
It's possible.

287
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:12,083
How the fuck do we stop this bitch?

288
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:16,791
We do what every one of the victims did
before they were killed.

289
00:29:17,833 --> 00:29:18,833
We hire her.

290
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:22,916
I'll be the bait.

291
00:29:25,541 --> 00:29:26,666
I go undercover.

292
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:29,000
The girl likes big shots.

293
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:31,583
I make it look like I work
in a brokerage house.

294
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:35,125
Get phony friends, family, fiancée,
profile history.

295
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:42,000
All my online activity looks like
I made a success of my life.

296
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:48,000
A month, all to give us enough material to
stretch over my law enforcement career.

297
00:29:57,541 --> 00:30:01,833
My new life's just going to look a little
repetitive to anyone who looks back.

298
00:30:03,666 --> 00:30:05,750
Lester's got to be in on it.

299
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:09,041
He's a freelance contractor.
He should be safe.

300
00:30:18,875 --> 00:30:23,083
Once I look legit, I do something
the new me wants to erase.

301
00:30:24,791 --> 00:30:25,833
KRYSTAL 23, Escort

302
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:33,083
Thanks.

303
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,166
Drink?

304
00:30:37,916 --> 00:30:38,916
I don't drink.

305
00:30:40,916 --> 00:30:41,958
What do you do?

306
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:48,333
Yes.

307
00:30:56,583 --> 00:30:57,583
Thank you.

308
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:08,500
Naturally, I do what any guilty boyfriend
does after having sex with a hooker,

309
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:09,875
I call my fiancée.

310
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:20,666
Next day, I get scared my girlfriend
is going to ask to see my records

311
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,416
so I try to contact our hacker.

312
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:27,166
Same dark Ether bulletin boards
used by the other victims.

313
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:28,958
We know her M.O.

314
00:31:29,583 --> 00:31:30,875
She'll come to me.

315
00:31:31,666 --> 00:31:35,375
Of course, we rule out applicants
who don't match the description.

316
00:31:40,041 --> 00:31:41,041
Sol Grayson?

317
00:31:44,125 --> 00:31:45,166
Changed my mind.

318
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,458
By the way, I'll need a boatload of cash.

319
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:34,041
She can see past our metadata, so
I don't want a cop within a mile of me.

320
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,166
Since we can't communicate without
blowing my cover,

321
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,416
we use a signal.

322
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:20,125
Don't look at me.

323
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:24,041
What can I do for you, Sol Grayson,
stockbroker?

324
00:33:26,083 --> 00:33:27,916
I want to get rid of an affair.

325
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:32,333
- Well, not even an affair really. I...
- I don't care.

326
00:33:33,916 --> 00:33:34,916
Cash only.

327
00:33:37,833 --> 00:33:40,291
Let's go somewhere we won't be disturbed.

328
00:33:41,041 --> 00:33:42,166
Your apartment.

329
00:33:45,541 --> 00:33:48,625
When she does show, all we've got to do
is get her close enough

330
00:33:48,708 --> 00:33:50,916
for Lester to scan her frequency.

331
00:33:51,708 --> 00:33:55,166
We trace her chain of proxies
to her record of the killings.

332
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,416
We got her.

333
00:34:23,416 --> 00:34:24,416
Drink?

334
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:09,458
I'm in.

335
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:11,250
Just like that?

336
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:12,833
Here we go.

337
00:35:32,833 --> 00:35:34,166
Here's how it works.

338
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,208
Believe it or not, I got a policy.

339
00:35:36,916 --> 00:35:38,291
To respect your privacy,

340
00:35:38,375 --> 00:35:40,666
I'm only going to look at
what you want me to see.

341
00:35:40,916 --> 00:35:41,916
Nothing more.

342
00:35:42,833 --> 00:35:44,666
That is, unless you cross me.

343
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:47,333
Do that,

344
00:35:47,833 --> 00:35:49,750
and you will wish you were fucking dead.

345
00:35:52,666 --> 00:35:53,833
Sounds reasonable.

346
00:35:55,541 --> 00:35:56,541
Well?

347
00:35:57,791 --> 00:35:58,791
A week ago...

348
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:01,083
Monday...

349
00:36:02,625 --> 00:36:05,541
about 11-10-23-10.

350
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:10,208
I see her.

351
00:36:10,666 --> 00:36:12,125
That the girl you want gone?

352
00:36:16,666 --> 00:36:17,666
Yeah.

353
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:21,916
You want me to fix her side too?
I can leave a gap.

354
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,708
What if she looks back
and see it's gone?

355
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,291
Doesn't seem like the type of girl
who looks back.

356
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:33,875
Better not to leave it lying around.
She could use it against you.

357
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:43,541
Yes.

358
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:55,791
What do you want in its place
to fill the timeline?

359
00:36:56,833 --> 00:36:58,666
Went to bed earlier than I did.

360
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:01,916
Problem is you called your girlfriend
after the hooker left.

361
00:37:02,583 --> 00:37:03,791
Oh, yeah.

362
00:37:03,875 --> 00:37:07,833
And I'm guessing it's the girlfriend
you don't want seeing the rendezvous.

363
00:37:08,625 --> 00:37:11,833
If your girl looked back,
she'd see that the call isn't there.

364
00:37:14,041 --> 00:37:15,208
A night at a bar?

365
00:37:16,208 --> 00:37:17,541
Too many other people.

366
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:19,000
Complicates things.

367
00:37:21,333 --> 00:37:23,875
I'll make it look like you were alone
in your apartment.

368
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,375
From another night that you were
alone in your apartment.

369
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:31,958
Luckily, there are a few to choose from.

370
00:37:34,625 --> 00:37:36,291
No wonder you hired a hooker.

371
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:41,125
I'll show you what I'm doing.

372
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:48,875
It's all the media you consume
I got to fix.

373
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:52,083
How jealous is your girlfriend?

374
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:55,750
Anyone looking close,
especially another fixer...

375
00:37:59,041 --> 00:38:01,541
they're gonna see the joins
unless I'm here 'til next week.

376
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,625
Worse things in the world?

377
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:06,041
You can't afford me.

378
00:38:06,916 --> 00:38:09,583
Yes.

379
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,333
So business is good.

380
00:38:16,625 --> 00:38:19,958
You'd be surprised what people want
to pretend never happened.

381
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:27,791
Any job you wouldn't take?

382
00:38:31,541 --> 00:38:33,666
Help someone get away with murder.

383
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,541
Depends who they killed.

384
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,375
See ya next time.

385
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:53,875
I'm going to have to remove me
from your life, too.

386
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,333
This, tonight.

387
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:12,333
Where are you?

388
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,791
So strange to look at you and see nothing.

389
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:19,041
No name.

390
00:39:19,416 --> 00:39:20,833
No data, nothing.

391
00:39:20,916 --> 00:39:22,750
You must get a lot of stares.

392
00:39:23,625 --> 00:39:24,875
I don't go out much.

393
00:39:24,958 --> 00:39:26,833
And when I do, I keep my head down.

394
00:39:28,041 --> 00:39:29,708
People think it's a mistake.

395
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,166
Why not use an alias?

396
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:35,958
I don't want to exist as someone else.

397
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:39,000
I don't want to exist.

398
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:41,833
You have a name.

399
00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:44,041
I do.

400
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:53,708
What, is that it?

401
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:56,583
I don't mean to be rude.
I got another customer.

402
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,958
What about people with memories of you?

403
00:40:01,625 --> 00:40:02,625
Like me?

404
00:40:03,625 --> 00:40:05,208
You can't get rid of memories.

405
00:40:06,416 --> 00:40:07,750
I can think of a way.

406
00:40:10,458 --> 00:40:13,583
I'm going to take a wild guess
that you don't have a permit for that.

407
00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:15,125
Turn around.

408
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:19,333
Look away.

409
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:23,625
Don't worry.

410
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:26,333
I'll get rid of everything of me
in your record

411
00:40:26,416 --> 00:40:28,291
up until the last time you
looked at me.

412
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,250
Just now.

413
00:40:51,083 --> 00:40:52,083
Sal?

414
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:56,458
I got her fifth proxy.

415
00:40:57,625 --> 00:40:59,041
I don't have her record.

416
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:00,958
Yet.

417
00:41:08,916 --> 00:41:10,166
Why didn't she kill you?

418
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:12,083
Oh, sorry to disappoint you, Charlie.

419
00:41:12,166 --> 00:41:13,958
Oh, that's right. She didn't fuck you.

420
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:15,708
Not her type, I guess.

421
00:41:16,083 --> 00:41:18,125
What's to say she doesn't go
into your record

422
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:20,458
and see her stockbroker suddenly
become a cop?

423
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:21,666
I don't think so.

424
00:41:22,208 --> 00:41:23,083
She said something.

425
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:26,125
She said,
"I only look at what you want me to see."

426
00:41:26,208 --> 00:41:27,791
Principled serial killer.

427
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,333
I don't know why.

428
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:31,083
I believed her.

429
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:38,833
Reinforcements.

430
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:42,750
Tech specialist, CT unit.

431
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:46,291
Commissioner's personal recommendation.

432
00:41:47,166 --> 00:41:48,166
My.

433
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:53,750
Sal, Cyrus Frear.

434
00:41:54,708 --> 00:41:55,708
Hi.

435
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:57,750
Hi.

436
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
We're in.

437
00:42:29,291 --> 00:42:30,750
What happens now?

438
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:34,666
- We watch.
- We can only see through her eyes,

439
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:36,666
what she's doing right now.

440
00:42:37,208 --> 00:42:40,625
We can't go back in her record
until we trace her chain of proxies.

441
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:43,166
Concentrate. Find a clue.

442
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,416
Just 'cause she doesn't use the recog,
doesn't stop us.

443
00:42:49,916 --> 00:42:53,375
Eclectic taste. A lot of
mid-century modern, high end.

444
00:42:54,125 --> 00:42:57,541
- Any read on the building?
- Loft. Downtown.

445
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:06,291
Only way to locate her record is when
she's active in the Ether.

446
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:08,708
Find the last proxy, we find her.

447
00:43:25,208 --> 00:43:26,541
Matches the perp's.

448
00:43:30,083 --> 00:43:32,583
Generally reload a gun
'cause you fired it.

449
00:43:42,041 --> 00:43:43,500
Mind's Eye's got nothing on it.

450
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:46,583
I've got a feeling this girl
doesn't network.

451
00:44:04,958 --> 00:44:06,791
She's careful where she looks.

452
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:26,000
She's in the Ether.

453
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,333
How did she get past the protocols?

454
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:30,041
Doesn't seem to be an issue.

455
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:31,541
She's logging into a record.

456
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:35,250
Whose eyes is she looking through?

457
00:44:36,458 --> 00:44:39,375
Jesper Nix, a stupid
money-leading art dealer.

458
00:44:39,458 --> 00:44:41,458
Two galleries on the Upper East Side.

459
00:44:48,625 --> 00:44:49,625
Who is he?

460
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:51,708
Max Keener, 45.

461
00:44:52,416 --> 00:44:53,750
Known forger, priors.

462
00:44:55,458 --> 00:44:56,458
Paintings?

463
00:44:56,791 --> 00:44:58,416
I know what they're supposed to be.

464
00:45:05,625 --> 00:45:07,041
Naughty Jesper.

465
00:45:12,125 --> 00:45:14,500
She's getting rid of Jesper's meeting
with the forger.

466
00:45:25,625 --> 00:45:30,083
Replaces it with Jesper acting like he's
discovered these priceless works of art.

467
00:45:33,958 --> 00:45:36,083
My God, exquisite.

468
00:45:43,791 --> 00:45:44,833
She logged out already.

469
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:46,375
You trace her?

470
00:45:47,416 --> 00:45:48,416
Twelve proxies.

471
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,708
The last one's anonymous.

472
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:53,500
Proxies hackers used to hide.

473
00:45:55,541 --> 00:45:57,458
Nice job, connecting the dots.

474
00:45:59,708 --> 00:46:00,708
Not 'til the end.

475
00:46:03,083 --> 00:46:05,500
- What's Nix doing now?
- "You live to tell the tale."

476
00:46:07,625 --> 00:46:10,083
Setting up appointments
to sell the fakes.

477
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:12,208
- Keep tabs on him.
- Yes, sir.

478
00:46:12,291 --> 00:46:15,625
Let me know if our agoraphobe
goes out on the town.

479
00:47:21,125 --> 00:47:22,625
We watched her all night.

480
00:47:23,416 --> 00:47:25,416
We still don't have her location.

481
00:47:32,041 --> 00:47:33,500
Got to hand it to her.

482
00:47:35,125 --> 00:47:36,666
She really is analog.

483
00:48:11,833 --> 00:48:13,500
Wish she'd look out a window.

484
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:15,958
Finally.

485
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:23,583
Where'd she go?

486
00:48:24,208 --> 00:48:25,375
We lost her.

487
00:48:25,458 --> 00:48:27,083
The chain of proxies?

488
00:48:28,041 --> 00:48:29,250
She broke the links.

489
00:48:29,875 --> 00:48:30,958
Start a new chain.

490
00:48:31,666 --> 00:48:32,916
Common practice.

491
00:48:34,416 --> 00:48:35,416
Did she see us?

492
00:48:36,333 --> 00:48:37,333
No.

493
00:48:48,916 --> 00:48:51,875
At least we know she likes her eggs
sunny-side up.

494
00:48:55,708 --> 00:48:56,583
Sir.

495
00:48:56,666 --> 00:48:59,333
What's happened?
Nix sell one of his paintings?

496
00:48:59,458 --> 00:49:01,625
We don't have to worry
about that anymore, sir.

497
00:49:01,916 --> 00:49:02,916
Nix is dead.

498
00:49:03,416 --> 00:49:04,416
Same M.O.?

499
00:49:05,541 --> 00:49:06,625
Killer's POV.

500
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:21,291
What do you want?

501
00:49:25,583 --> 00:49:27,583
Are you fucking crazy?!

502
00:49:30,458 --> 00:49:31,750
What do you want?

503
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:39,416
What do you want?

504
00:49:40,583 --> 00:49:41,666
What do you want?

505
00:49:49,333 --> 00:49:51,666
They just posted from the crime scene.

506
00:49:58,333 --> 00:49:59,416
This case...

507
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:03,750
it's become a priority for us.

508
00:50:06,333 --> 00:50:08,000
We understand, Commissioner.

509
00:50:09,083 --> 00:50:11,083
I don't know if you do, Detective.

510
00:50:13,958 --> 00:50:15,208
Five murders.

511
00:50:16,041 --> 00:50:17,291
It's not the murders.

512
00:50:20,875 --> 00:50:24,166
Sorry, Mr. Kenik.
This is a homicide case.

513
00:50:30,541 --> 00:50:33,291
This level of anonymizing

514
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:36,458
makes all crime possible.

515
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,083
It hinders our expansion to sub-crime.

516
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:46,333
- Those lowlifes got what was coming...
- Victims.

517
00:50:48,083 --> 00:50:49,833
We're getting reports daily.

518
00:50:50,166 --> 00:50:52,083
Ghosts, ciphers...

519
00:50:52,166 --> 00:50:53,666
call them what you will.

520
00:50:53,875 --> 00:50:56,000
The integrity of the system
is compromised.

521
00:50:56,083 --> 00:50:57,375
The integrity?

522
00:51:00,458 --> 00:51:02,166
We rely on transparency.

523
00:51:02,916 --> 00:51:05,166
We can't control what we can't see.

524
00:51:05,833 --> 00:51:09,125
We require persistent identity.

525
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,291
This isn't an isolated case.

526
00:51:13,166 --> 00:51:15,583
We believe there's a ring of individuals

527
00:51:15,875 --> 00:51:17,708
who may or may not know each other.

528
00:51:18,041 --> 00:51:22,041
They, like her, anonymize themselves
and others.

529
00:51:27,666 --> 00:51:29,041
I don't care

530
00:51:29,625 --> 00:51:31,666
the victims no longer exist.

531
00:51:34,166 --> 00:51:35,666
I care that she doesn't.

532
00:51:37,333 --> 00:51:40,000
In my mind, she's murdered herself.

533
00:51:42,083 --> 00:51:43,083
Oh, I see.

534
00:51:44,166 --> 00:51:46,208
Taking a life,
that's not important.

535
00:51:46,291 --> 00:51:47,958
Her not having one, that is?

536
00:51:48,041 --> 00:51:49,125
Yes.

537
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:52,416
Now you understand.

538
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,666
We need the first proxy in the new chain.

539
00:52:11,583 --> 00:52:13,250
You're going back under cover.

540
00:52:13,333 --> 00:52:17,041
Sitting in a police precinct
with the commissioner of police.

541
00:52:17,125 --> 00:52:20,750
I think that's the definition
of blowing my cover.

542
00:52:20,833 --> 00:52:22,583
It's only been three days.

543
00:52:23,125 --> 00:52:24,375
We put a patch over it.

544
00:52:24,458 --> 00:52:27,125
Make it look like you've been
in the brokerage house.

545
00:52:27,208 --> 00:52:29,458
If, like you say, she doesn't look back,

546
00:52:30,041 --> 00:52:31,041
she might go for it.

547
00:52:31,125 --> 00:52:32,166
Loyal customer.

548
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:34,083
Maybe she does have a thing for you.

549
00:52:34,166 --> 00:52:37,083
Yeah, she's also got a thing
for blowing people's brains out.

550
00:52:37,166 --> 00:52:38,375
You heard what Kenik said.

551
00:52:38,458 --> 00:52:41,791
There's a fuck of a lot of commercial
interests at work here.

552
00:52:41,875 --> 00:52:43,541
Way above our pay grade.

553
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:47,458
Anonymity is the enemy.

554
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:51,041
We got to find out how she does it and...

555
00:52:52,791 --> 00:52:54,333
de-anonymize her.

556
00:52:55,458 --> 00:52:56,750
Same deal.

557
00:52:57,458 --> 00:53:00,208
We stay back, so she's not spooked.

558
00:53:00,791 --> 00:53:01,791
Gentlemen...

559
00:53:03,125 --> 00:53:04,750
when you make the patch...

560
00:53:05,416 --> 00:53:07,833
try to make it half as good as hers.

561
00:54:18,458 --> 00:54:21,125
You sure this isn't an excuse
to see me again?

562
00:54:22,416 --> 00:54:24,250
You don't like repeat business?

563
00:54:25,458 --> 00:54:26,916
Why haven't you done it?

564
00:54:27,541 --> 00:54:29,375
Waiting for a special occasion.

565
00:54:32,125 --> 00:54:33,875
Cut up some lines while I do this.

566
00:54:40,333 --> 00:54:42,250
I can replace the dealer with a hooker.

567
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:46,750
- Dogs.
- I don't like dogs.

568
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:48,833
Or nothing at all.

569
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:52,083
You ever met anyone else
who can do what you do?

570
00:54:53,416 --> 00:54:54,875
Who doesn't exist?

571
00:54:55,958 --> 00:54:56,958
How could I?

572
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,458
No need to do the dealer's side.

573
00:55:40,916 --> 00:55:42,500
He never laid eyes on you.

574
00:55:43,125 --> 00:55:45,125
I love those guys who do it blind.

575
00:55:49,416 --> 00:55:53,041
We close our eyes
to pray, cry, kiss, dream...

576
00:55:54,125 --> 00:55:55,125
or break the law.

577
00:55:59,041 --> 00:56:00,625
You can stay anonymous.

578
00:56:02,708 --> 00:56:04,291
It's just really fucking hard.

579
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:07,708
You do this why? Pay the bills?

580
00:56:08,541 --> 00:56:09,541
Why else?

581
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,416
You might have an agenda.

582
00:56:14,583 --> 00:56:16,125
You got the wrong girl.

583
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:18,541
It's simple.

584
00:56:19,333 --> 00:56:21,666
They try to look, I try not to be seen.

585
00:56:23,458 --> 00:56:25,625
But if you're asking
if I think it's fucked up?

586
00:56:25,708 --> 00:56:27,125
Yeah, I think it's fucked up.

587
00:56:27,208 --> 00:56:29,166
They say it's for our safety.

588
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:31,083
Why don't I feel safe?

589
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:38,125
How long have you not existed?

590
00:56:39,625 --> 00:56:41,291
You ask a lot of questions.

591
00:56:41,375 --> 00:56:42,833
You don't answer them.

592
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,041
Eighteen.

593
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:02,208
Once in a lifetime chance.

594
00:57:03,375 --> 00:57:06,416
Started erasing.
I didn't stop until I was gone.

595
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:10,833
In a lot of ways, it's the analog evidence

596
00:57:10,916 --> 00:57:13,083
that's harder to track down and destroy.

597
00:57:15,916 --> 00:57:16,958
DFE.

598
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,750
Delete fucking everything.

599
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:25,791
I never was happy in the big room.

600
00:57:26,041 --> 00:57:27,083
The big room?

601
00:57:27,166 --> 00:57:28,333
Outside world.

602
00:57:29,666 --> 00:57:30,666
Flesh space.

603
00:57:32,125 --> 00:57:34,833
Part of the planet
that's not cyberspace.

604
00:57:43,916 --> 00:57:45,333
You know that's illegal.

605
00:57:50,291 --> 00:57:52,416
You sure you have a girlfriend, Sol?

606
00:57:53,541 --> 00:57:55,541
You sure act like a single guy.

607
00:58:32,833 --> 00:58:35,041
Is there something else you'd like to do?

608
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:38,500
That I can erase?

609
00:59:37,041 --> 00:59:38,750
Gotta make that disappear.

610
00:59:42,083 --> 00:59:43,875
Delete fucking everything.

611
00:59:45,125 --> 00:59:46,708
Especially the fucking.

612
00:59:49,916 --> 00:59:52,083
You really don't like to look back,
do you?

613
00:59:55,125 --> 00:59:56,125
Like you.

614
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:56,500
Hello, Sal Frieland,
Detective First Class.

615
01:01:58,208 --> 01:01:59,458
What have you done?

616
01:01:59,833 --> 01:02:02,583
It's not that you don't like to look back,
you can't.

617
01:02:03,583 --> 01:02:05,541
Not without giving away
who you really are.

618
01:02:06,708 --> 01:02:07,958
He's fucking dead.

619
01:02:08,541 --> 01:02:10,125
You should've thought about that.

620
01:02:13,041 --> 01:02:14,333
Don't try to find me.

621
01:02:15,041 --> 01:02:16,583
Look and you are dead.

622
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:41,500
You let her escape.

623
01:02:43,416 --> 01:02:45,291
And kill Lester on the way out.

624
01:02:48,416 --> 01:02:51,083
I don't know
if you can walk that back, Sal.

625
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:55,791
She saw past our wall.

626
01:02:58,375 --> 01:02:59,625
Her own records.

627
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:07,083
Go home.

628
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:10,750
Take some time.

629
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:43,916
I'm sorry.

630
01:06:47,333 --> 01:06:48,333
I'm sorry.

631
01:06:51,458 --> 01:06:52,458
I'm sorry.

632
01:06:55,041 --> 01:06:57,666
I took my eyes off him for a second.

633
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,125
One second.

634
01:07:14,041 --> 01:07:15,458
Yeah, that was him.

635
01:09:12,666 --> 01:09:14,291
- Kristen.
- Hi, Sal.

636
01:09:15,125 --> 01:09:17,291
Send me your memories of Salvador.

637
01:09:18,083 --> 01:09:19,083
What?

638
01:09:19,708 --> 01:09:20,708
No.

639
01:09:21,208 --> 01:09:23,375
I don't want to go back to there.
It hurts.

640
01:09:23,458 --> 01:09:26,041
Look, please, just send me a picture.
Anything.

641
01:09:26,791 --> 01:09:28,000
Why? What for?

642
01:09:28,833 --> 01:09:29,833
Mine are gone.

643
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:31,500
Gone?

644
01:09:34,833 --> 01:09:35,833
Okay.

645
01:09:41,416 --> 01:09:42,458
Shit.

646
01:09:44,708 --> 01:09:45,833
Sal, he's gone.

647
01:09:49,041 --> 01:09:50,041
He's gone.

648
01:09:52,333 --> 01:09:54,041
What the fuck is happening?

649
01:09:55,166 --> 01:09:56,166
Sal?

650
01:09:57,541 --> 01:09:58,541
Sal?

651
01:10:28,416 --> 01:10:29,416
Sal.

652
01:10:30,291 --> 01:10:31,291
Sal?

653
01:10:34,166 --> 01:10:35,166
It's Thomas.

654
01:10:40,333 --> 01:10:41,333
Thomas DeVry.

655
01:11:32,041 --> 01:11:35,541
Intersection in 30 meters.
Apply brake.

656
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:37,208
Please, stop now.

657
01:11:40,208 --> 01:11:42,458
Check your surroundings for safety.

658
01:11:49,875 --> 01:11:51,875
All clear. Please proceed.

659
01:11:59,916 --> 01:12:02,083
I told you to take some time, Sal.

660
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:03,750
Leave it alone.

661
01:12:03,833 --> 01:12:05,375
She won't leave me alone.

662
01:12:05,541 --> 01:12:07,041
She keeps jacking my eye.

663
01:12:10,416 --> 01:12:12,041
I don't know what I'm looking at.

664
01:12:14,791 --> 01:12:16,708
"I can't believe my eyes"...

665
01:12:17,541 --> 01:12:18,958
is not an expression.

666
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,250
I'm scared to sleep.

667
01:12:24,208 --> 01:12:26,166
Can't hide. She knows where I am.

668
01:12:28,416 --> 01:12:29,416
Everything.

669
01:12:32,958 --> 01:12:34,375
My son, Salvador...

670
01:12:38,833 --> 01:12:40,625
all the good memories, gone.

671
01:12:44,125 --> 01:12:45,166
What happened?

672
01:12:51,333 --> 01:12:53,750
She makes me watch it over
and over again.

673
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:57,125
Sure you're not seeing things?

674
01:12:57,208 --> 01:13:02,041
Of course I'm fucking seeing things.
That's the whole point.

675
01:13:04,625 --> 01:13:06,166
We're hiring more hackers.

676
01:13:06,833 --> 01:13:07,875
Like her.

677
01:13:08,583 --> 01:13:10,291
What else are we going to do?

678
01:13:11,041 --> 01:13:12,250
It's what you said.

679
01:13:13,208 --> 01:13:16,125
Everything's connected,
everything's vulnerable.

680
01:13:17,791 --> 01:13:18,791
Shit.

681
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:21,750
Stopped taking calls
from the commissioner.

682
01:13:21,833 --> 01:13:23,666
We watch, they don't watch us.

683
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:26,791
We know where they are, we're invisible.

684
01:13:30,333 --> 01:13:32,166
How do I stop it Charlie?

685
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:34,125
You find her...

686
01:13:34,875 --> 01:13:35,875
it stops.

687
01:13:38,041 --> 01:13:39,416
I wish Lester was here.

688
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:42,125
Alert in the Ether.

689
01:13:43,041 --> 01:13:44,833
Warrant for Detective Frieland.

690
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:47,666
In the shooting of Thomas DeVry.

691
01:13:51,875 --> 01:13:53,625
He lives in my building. My neighbor.

692
01:14:03,083 --> 01:14:05,625
I fired the gun. I didn't shoot him.

693
01:14:05,708 --> 01:14:07,583
It sure as hell looks like you did.

694
01:14:07,666 --> 01:14:10,375
No one ever tell you that
looks can be deceiving?

695
01:14:10,458 --> 01:14:13,250
Slug from your nine millimeter
found in the wall...

696
01:14:13,333 --> 01:14:14,750
ballistics points to you.

697
01:14:14,833 --> 01:14:16,416
Have you seen the autopsy?

698
01:14:18,666 --> 01:14:21,333
A nine millimeter doesn't make a hole
in you like that.

699
01:14:21,833 --> 01:14:23,250
Inconclusive, says here.

700
01:14:23,333 --> 01:14:27,125
It's a construction manipulated,
made up. It's fake.

701
01:14:27,625 --> 01:14:30,541
There's no evidence that it's fraudulent.

702
01:14:30,625 --> 01:14:32,791
And there's no evidence to say it's real.

703
01:14:34,625 --> 01:14:37,541
We can't assume
everything is counterfeit.

704
01:14:38,875 --> 01:14:40,541
We have to believe our eyes

705
01:14:40,958 --> 01:14:42,750
or the system doesn't work.

706
01:14:42,833 --> 01:14:43,875
It's her.

707
01:14:43,958 --> 01:14:47,166
She's trying to fuck with me.
She wants me off the case.

708
01:14:48,541 --> 01:14:49,625
She got her wish.

709
01:14:52,833 --> 01:14:55,416
You're suspended,
pending an investigation.

710
01:14:56,250 --> 01:14:57,333
House arrest.

711
01:14:58,208 --> 01:15:00,583
Surveillance around the clock.

712
01:15:29,708 --> 01:15:30,875
Feels strange, sir.

713
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Watching you.

714
01:15:33,416 --> 01:15:34,583
Then don't.

715
01:18:58,458 --> 01:18:59,958
You really are a cop.

716
01:19:01,625 --> 01:19:05,458
When you all hacked my eye,
everyone was looking at me.

717
01:19:05,541 --> 01:19:07,541
You can be distracting.

718
01:19:09,583 --> 01:19:10,833
You remembered?

719
01:19:13,125 --> 01:19:15,291
There was something else
in the reflection.

720
01:19:18,333 --> 01:19:19,458
Stay where you are.

721
01:19:20,125 --> 01:19:21,666
Put the gun down, Sal.

722
01:19:22,166 --> 01:19:24,291
Won't do you any good.
I can see what you see.

723
01:19:29,250 --> 01:19:32,041
I would show you around,
but you've already seen the place.

724
01:19:34,333 --> 01:19:35,333
How was it?

725
01:19:36,541 --> 01:19:38,458
Did you all like what you saw?

726
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:41,458
You're gonna show yourself?

727
01:19:42,041 --> 01:19:43,875
Makes too much work for me.

728
01:19:45,458 --> 01:19:46,458
Why?

729
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:50,500
Why are you doing this to me?

730
01:19:51,708 --> 01:19:53,166
I can't take the credit.

731
01:19:54,041 --> 01:19:57,416
Someone is killing my customers,
trying to make it look like it's me.

732
01:19:58,041 --> 01:19:59,166
I can't tell.

733
01:20:00,250 --> 01:20:02,125
I want to show you something.

734
01:20:05,208 --> 01:20:06,208
My record.

735
01:20:07,541 --> 01:20:09,125
Time of the murders.

736
01:20:09,666 --> 01:20:10,708
Lester.

737
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,083
Someone made it look like I did it.

738
01:20:38,125 --> 01:20:40,125
Are you saying the hacker got hacked?

739
01:20:40,833 --> 01:20:44,333
They could be watching through
our eyes right now. Yours, mine.

740
01:20:45,875 --> 01:20:47,541
I'm not safe anywhere.

741
01:20:48,291 --> 01:20:49,291
Neither are you.

742
01:20:50,125 --> 01:20:52,291
You're the last one I was with
who's alive.

743
01:20:54,875 --> 01:20:56,750
How do I know you're not lying?

744
01:20:57,750 --> 01:21:01,875
How do I know that what you just showed me
is your actual record?

745
01:21:02,708 --> 01:21:03,708
You don't.

746
01:21:15,875 --> 01:21:18,833
What part of "suspended"
do you not understand?

747
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:20,750
You jammed your meta.

748
01:21:20,958 --> 01:21:22,375
Assaulted a fellow officer.

749
01:21:22,875 --> 01:21:26,166
Charlie, the other DNA
that we couldn't identify,

750
01:21:26,625 --> 01:21:28,333
maybe it's not degraded.

751
01:21:29,833 --> 01:21:31,291
Maybe it's unregistered.

752
01:21:32,625 --> 01:21:33,625
Another cipher.

753
01:21:33,666 --> 01:21:35,500
Or maybe it's degraded.

754
01:21:35,875 --> 01:21:38,791
She showed me her record
when Lester was killed.

755
01:21:40,541 --> 01:21:42,291
She's not there when the shot's fired.

756
01:21:42,375 --> 01:21:44,000
Well, where is she now?

757
01:21:44,333 --> 01:21:46,291
You've obviously held her for questioning.

758
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:51,958
I don't think it's her.

759
01:21:52,041 --> 01:21:53,083
Why?

760
01:21:53,375 --> 01:21:54,500
'Cause you fucked her?

761
01:21:56,958 --> 01:22:00,208
Her alibi could be fabricated
like all of her hacks.

762
01:22:00,291 --> 01:22:01,291
Proves nothing.

763
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:04,208
That's the problem,
that nothing proves anything.

764
01:22:05,291 --> 01:22:07,666
She's playing you, Sal.

765
01:22:09,416 --> 01:22:14,000
You're officially relieved of all duty,
pending a departmental hearing.

766
01:22:14,625 --> 01:22:17,208
All access privileges rescinded.

767
01:22:20,333 --> 01:22:21,666
We're watching you.

768
01:22:23,333 --> 01:22:24,916
You should thank us.

769
01:22:46,166 --> 01:22:47,291
What's he doing?

770
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:50,166
Whole lot of nothing.

771
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,833
All units respond.

772
01:24:43,250 --> 01:24:44,250
Damn it.

773
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:45,750
Why'd you do that?

774
01:24:56,125 --> 01:24:57,166
I fell for it.

775
01:24:58,708 --> 01:25:01,291
Looking through his eyes,
I forgot to look through yours.

776
01:25:01,708 --> 01:25:03,666
Well, now you can both look through mine.

777
01:25:08,666 --> 01:25:09,666
Why?

778
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,125
Why'd you do this?

779
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:14,791
It was perfect.

780
01:25:16,916 --> 01:25:18,416
We were never meant to meet.

781
01:25:18,875 --> 01:25:20,041
Who are you?

782
01:25:20,625 --> 01:25:22,083
I know who you are.

783
01:25:23,916 --> 01:25:25,291
You found me in the Ether?

784
01:25:25,375 --> 01:25:28,083
No. No, you found me.

785
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:30,916
You're the anonymous proxy?

786
01:25:31,708 --> 01:25:33,333
The last one in the chain.

787
01:25:33,791 --> 01:25:35,083
You kept me safe.

788
01:25:35,750 --> 01:25:38,166
They hired me to lead them to you.

789
01:25:38,750 --> 01:25:40,083
I led them away.

790
01:25:41,875 --> 01:25:43,208
You've seen my record.

791
01:25:43,583 --> 01:25:44,791
You know how I hide.

792
01:25:44,875 --> 01:25:46,625
The algorithm is brilliant.

793
01:25:47,083 --> 01:25:48,125
Really.

794
01:25:49,250 --> 01:25:51,708
I know how bad you want to disappear.

795
01:25:53,708 --> 01:25:55,208
You erase records...

796
01:25:55,958 --> 01:25:57,958
but you can't erase memories.

797
01:26:00,458 --> 01:26:01,458
I can.

798
01:26:02,416 --> 01:26:03,416
No.

799
01:26:04,416 --> 01:26:07,541
We can hack this out,
like it didn't happen.

800
01:26:07,708 --> 01:26:08,958
You can disappear.

801
01:26:09,416 --> 01:26:10,416
We can.

802
01:26:15,791 --> 01:26:16,791
No.

803
01:26:18,708 --> 01:26:19,916
It's different now.

804
01:26:24,333 --> 01:26:26,625
Why did you make it look like it was me?

805
01:26:29,416 --> 01:26:30,500
We're together.

806
01:27:49,541 --> 01:27:51,166
His record's gone.

807
01:27:55,750 --> 01:27:58,708
You have no idea who this Cyrus Frear was?

808
01:27:59,125 --> 01:28:00,833
He fucking worked for you.

809
01:28:03,916 --> 01:28:05,541
You recommended him.

810
01:28:06,583 --> 01:28:07,583
I did?

811
01:28:09,125 --> 01:28:10,125
Yes.

812
01:28:11,625 --> 01:28:13,500
He made it look like I did.

813
01:28:19,375 --> 01:28:20,375
The girl?

814
01:28:23,125 --> 01:28:24,125
Where is she?

815
01:28:26,250 --> 01:28:27,625
Who is she?

816
01:28:29,541 --> 01:28:31,291
Aren't you going to look?

817
01:29:09,916 --> 01:29:10,916
Look at me.

818
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,083
I'm sorry.

819
01:29:18,625 --> 01:29:21,000
No way to warn you without him knowing.

820
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:24,541
Only way to find him
was to let him find you.

821
01:29:25,708 --> 01:29:27,583
You got to work on your timing.

822
01:29:28,333 --> 01:29:29,500
Cut it close.

823
01:29:32,458 --> 01:29:34,083
So we found you.

824
01:29:35,041 --> 01:29:36,041
Your life.

825
01:29:37,541 --> 01:29:38,875
That was the beginning.

826
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:41,291
Anyone I was with.

827
01:29:45,250 --> 01:29:46,916
He didn't want me like that.

828
01:29:49,166 --> 01:29:51,458
So no one else could have me either.

829
01:29:52,916 --> 01:29:55,375
Don't suppose you're going to tell me
how you do it.

830
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:58,291
How you disappear.

831
01:29:59,333 --> 01:30:01,958
It's there for anyone to see
if you know where to look.

832
01:30:04,458 --> 01:30:06,083
You have my record already.

833
01:30:08,708 --> 01:30:09,708
They do.

834
01:30:13,166 --> 01:30:14,583
I gave it to all of you.

835
01:30:17,041 --> 01:30:18,083
The algorithm.

836
01:30:19,541 --> 01:30:21,791
Breaks my life up
into fractions of seconds

837
01:30:21,875 --> 01:30:24,541
and randomly stores them
in the records of everyone else.

838
01:30:25,416 --> 01:30:28,166
But if you try to find
that split second of me,

839
01:30:29,041 --> 01:30:30,666
it would go by without you knowing.

840
01:30:33,166 --> 01:30:37,000
You have to have the algorithm
to put my entire life back together.

841
01:30:38,250 --> 01:30:39,791
If you want to look back.

842
01:30:43,833 --> 01:30:47,583
Any charges, I'll make it all go away
before you do.

843
01:30:48,625 --> 01:30:50,791
You invade my privacy, it's nothing.

844
01:30:50,875 --> 01:30:52,833
I try to get it back, it's a crime.

845
01:30:54,291 --> 01:30:55,375
Don't you get it?

846
01:30:56,541 --> 01:30:59,125
The more you try to hide,
the more attention you attract.

847
01:30:59,833 --> 01:31:02,583
Why is it so important
that nobody knows you?

848
01:31:04,416 --> 01:31:07,750
You get rid of other people's secrets.
What's yours?

849
01:31:08,916 --> 01:31:10,750
Does there have to be one?

850
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,291
Everyone has something to hide.

851
01:31:15,583 --> 01:31:16,791
That's what you do.

852
01:31:18,833 --> 01:31:21,250
What you look for every day of your life.

853
01:31:22,125 --> 01:31:23,583
Why you'll never understand.

854
01:31:27,541 --> 01:31:29,875
It's not that I have something to hide...

855
01:31:32,541 --> 01:31:34,500
I have nothing I want you to see.
