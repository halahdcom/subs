No. Jenna.

Monica, who did this?

22
00:03:15,045 --> 00:03:16,511
Who did this?

23
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,861
(Monica mumbles)

00:03:23,627 --> 00:03:25,352

[Woman On Phone] 911,
what's your emergency?

29
00:04:03,835 --> 00:04:05,148
Yes, I uh...

30
00:04:06,935 --> 00:04:07,818
I...

31
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:13,633
Yeah, I'm very sorry, I meant to dial

32
00:04:13,635 --> 00:04:15,352
411, not 911.

33
00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:16,603
(clears throat)

34
00:04:16,605 --> 00:04:17,993
Very sorry.

35
00:04:17,995 --> 00:04:18,828
Thank you.

I wanna propose a toast.

41
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,278
Let's drink to our friendship,
and let's not wait another

42
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,540
freaking two years
before we meet up again.

[Jason] What's up, boy?

49
00:04:53,948 --> 00:04:54,948
Jason!

50
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,447
Fuck, it's been a minute.

51
00:04:56,449 --> 00:04:59,008
Oh, I missed you so much, man, so much!

52
00:05:00,035 --> 00:05:00,866
Jenna.

53
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:02,153
Eric.

54
00:05:02,155 --> 00:05:03,803
Looking beautiful as always.

55
00:05:03,805 --> 00:05:05,083
Oh, thank you.

56
00:05:05,085 --> 00:05:06,303
Long time no see.

57
00:05:06,305 --> 00:05:07,443
Too long, I'd say.

58
00:05:07,445 --> 00:05:08,278
Too long.

59
00:05:09,385 --> 00:05:10,453
Here, this is for you.

60
00:05:10,455 --> 00:05:11,603
Oh, thank you.

61
00:05:11,605 --> 00:05:15,247
2008, it's a terrible
year for real estate,

62
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:17,293
great year for champagne though.

63
00:05:17,295 --> 00:05:18,145
Come on in, guys.

64
00:05:20,297 --> 00:05:21,434
Hey, you, guys!

65
00:05:21,436 --> 00:05:23,489
Hi, it's so good to finally meet you.

66
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:24,840
[Monica] Yeah, me too.

67
00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:25,766
Hey.
Hey.

68
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:28,242
Eric has told us so much about you.

69
00:05:30,655 --> 00:05:32,213
Dude.

70
00:05:32,215 --> 00:05:33,048
For you.

71
00:05:33,955 --> 00:05:34,786
What's this?

72
00:05:34,788 --> 00:05:35,796
Open it up, man.

73
00:05:38,529 --> 00:05:40,045
(rustling)

74
00:05:43,215 --> 00:05:44,388
Oh, my God!

75
00:05:45,588 --> 00:05:46,855
(chuckles)

76
00:05:47,705 --> 00:05:49,408
Dude, I thought we lost this picture.

77
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,080
[Jason] Yeah, right, crazy, huh?

78
00:05:51,082 --> 00:05:52,288
Where did you find this?

79
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,923
Behind an old dresser, by chance.

80
00:05:53,925 --> 00:05:56,133
I thought you might like to have it.

81
00:05:56,135 --> 00:05:57,133
Yeah, you kidding?

82
00:05:57,135 --> 00:05:58,148
Thank you.

83
00:05:59,095 --> 00:06:02,203
This was right in the
middle of my divorce.

84
00:06:02,205 --> 00:06:03,553
Best getaway ever, dude.

85
00:06:03,555 --> 00:06:06,183
Yeah, except that fish hooked in my ass.

86
00:06:06,185 --> 00:06:07,483
(laughs)

87
00:06:07,485 --> 00:06:08,979
You mean my favorite part?

88
00:06:08,981 --> 00:06:10,393
(laughs)

89
00:06:10,395 --> 00:06:11,833
Dude, look at you!

90
00:06:11,835 --> 00:06:12,835
Damn!

91
00:06:12,837 --> 00:06:14,543
Wow!
That's nice.

92
00:06:14,545 --> 00:06:15,866
[Eric] Thank you, you like it?

93
00:06:15,868 --> 00:06:16,723
[Jason] Yeah.

94
00:06:16,725 --> 00:06:17,678
Monica did that.

95
00:06:19,014 --> 00:06:22,117
Aw, she's so modest,
but she's so talented.

96
00:06:22,775 --> 00:06:24,283
Dude, this is a great place.

97
00:06:24,285 --> 00:06:25,588
Great neighborhood too.

98
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,023
Great, great neighborhood, man.

99
00:06:27,025 --> 00:06:28,543
That's what I keep saying, man.

100
00:06:28,545 --> 00:06:31,640
They're putting up 24 new
houses on this street alone.

101
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:33,543
We're the first ones to move in.

102
00:06:33,545 --> 00:06:34,803
You know what that means?

103
00:06:34,805 --> 00:06:35,988
No, sir.

104
00:06:39,337 --> 00:06:42,485
(loud heavy metal music)

105
00:06:42,487 --> 00:06:44,674
(laughs)

106
00:06:44,676 --> 00:06:47,409
(metal music blares)

107
00:06:51,276 --> 00:06:52,317
(stops)

108
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:56,763
We can party as loud
as we want to, dude!

109
00:06:56,765 --> 00:06:58,525
That's awesome, that's what's up!

110
00:06:58,527 --> 00:07:00,583
Oh, come on in, let's
open the champagne bottle.

111
00:07:00,585 --> 00:07:02,875
Yeah, sounds good.
How about that?

112
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,543
I wanna propose a toast.

113
00:07:10,545 --> 00:07:12,695
Let's drink to our
friendship, and let's not wait

114
00:07:12,697 --> 00:07:15,407
another freaking two years
before we meet up again.

115
00:07:15,409 --> 00:07:16,410
[Eric] Yes, sir.

116
00:07:16,412 --> 00:07:17,662
[All] Cheers!

117
00:07:19,962 --> 00:07:21,393
[Jason] That's it.

118
00:07:21,395 --> 00:07:23,688
I am so happy to see you, guys.

119
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,946
We were hoping to have
you guys over once we had

120
00:07:25,948 --> 00:07:27,228
fully moved in, but...

121
00:07:28,165 --> 00:07:30,813
Dude, Jenna tells me
you're shipping off to Iraq

122
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,933
again next week?

123
00:07:32,935 --> 00:07:36,313
Yes, sir, my third and last tour.

124
00:07:36,315 --> 00:07:37,148
Thank God.

125
00:07:39,369 --> 00:07:40,523
What's it like over there?

126
00:07:40,525 --> 00:07:42,967
Oh, you know, hot and
dirty just the way I like it.

127
00:07:42,969 --> 00:07:44,843
[Monica] Aren't you scared?

128
00:07:44,845 --> 00:07:45,676
Of what?

129
00:07:45,678 --> 00:07:46,518
Dying?

130
00:07:47,093 --> 00:07:49,173
No, no, ma'am.

131
00:07:49,175 --> 00:07:50,551
How about that?

132
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,634
What's it called, PT...?

133
00:07:52,636 --> 00:07:53,833
Oh, PTSD?

134
00:07:53,835 --> 00:07:54,666
Yeah.

135
00:07:54,668 --> 00:07:55,803
Posttraumatic stress disorder.

136
00:07:55,805 --> 00:07:58,693
We hear so much about
that in the news lately.

137
00:07:58,695 --> 00:08:01,235
Nah, I have seen some pretty awful stuff

138
00:08:01,237 --> 00:08:02,295
over there, but...

139
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,630
But for some reason it
doesn't really affect me.

140
00:08:06,615 --> 00:08:08,173
You got any stories?

141
00:08:08,175 --> 00:08:09,111
Eric.

142
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,570
He said it doesn't affect him.

143
00:08:11,572 --> 00:08:14,403
Nah, it's cool, it's cool, I don't mind.

144
00:08:14,405 --> 00:08:16,002
Most people are afraid to ask.

145
00:08:17,525 --> 00:08:18,939
So, yeah, my...

146
00:08:19,781 --> 00:08:21,943
My best buddy over there was
John, this big black dude,

147
00:08:21,945 --> 00:08:22,861
tough as nails.

148
00:08:24,265 --> 00:08:26,913
But he did have one weakness.

149
00:08:26,915 --> 00:08:29,313
He had a soft spot for the stray dogs.

150
00:08:29,315 --> 00:08:31,442
And the dogs, they knew it too.

151
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,341
They would follow him around until

152
00:08:33,343 --> 00:08:35,649
he fed them his last beef jerky and stuff.

153
00:08:35,651 --> 00:08:36,484
It's cute.

154
00:08:37,965 --> 00:08:41,060
So, yeah, this real
sad-looking dog showed up one day

155
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,137
and went directly up to big John.

156
00:08:43,954 --> 00:08:45,913
And the two hit it off right away,

157
00:08:45,915 --> 00:08:46,983
it was amazing to watch.

158
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,936
It was like they already knew each other.

159
00:08:48,938 --> 00:08:51,919
John said to me: "Yo
Jason, dude, brother man!

160
00:08:51,921 --> 00:08:53,060
(laughing)

161
00:08:53,062 --> 00:08:55,545
"This is the one, this is the one

162
00:08:55,547 --> 00:08:57,153
I'm gonna take home with me!

163
00:08:57,155 --> 00:08:58,063
And uh...

164
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,619
He was cool as shit, Eric.

165
00:09:01,621 --> 00:09:03,963
He was cool as shit, man.

166
00:09:03,965 --> 00:09:06,423
Next thing we know there
was this huge explosion

167
00:09:06,425 --> 00:09:07,933
and we all got thrown back.

168
00:09:08,837 --> 00:09:12,163
And once the dust settled,
I turned to John and one arm

169
00:09:12,165 --> 00:09:13,838
and half his face was blown off.

170
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,275
My God.

171
00:09:16,277 --> 00:09:17,903
Yeah, it was horrendous.

172
00:09:17,905 --> 00:09:20,893
He struggled in pain to
ask me one last thing.

173
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,973
He asked if I could take
care of his new dog.

174
00:09:23,975 --> 00:09:26,898
I said, "Yes, sir, yes, absolutely."

175
00:09:28,357 --> 00:09:30,715
And... Then he died
right there in my arms.

176
00:09:31,782 --> 00:09:33,323
(dramatic music)

177
00:09:35,265 --> 00:09:37,412
The thing he didn't know though

178
00:09:37,414 --> 00:09:40,401
was that the terrorists had put explosives

179
00:09:40,403 --> 00:09:44,026
within the dog's belly and
detonated it from afar.

180
00:09:44,028 --> 00:09:45,583
I'm sorry, man, that's terrible.

181
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,613
Yes, sir, a lot of crazy
shit happens over there.

182
00:09:48,615 --> 00:09:51,237
Believe you me, and that's
just one of the mild stories,

183
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:52,072
but uh...

184
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:55,333
Anyway, we needn't gotta
talk about all that.

185
00:09:55,335 --> 00:09:56,620
So what have you been up to, dude,

186
00:09:56,622 --> 00:09:58,370
for the last couple of years

187
00:09:58,372 --> 00:09:59,703
that you can afford a place like this?

188
00:09:59,705 --> 00:10:00,743
God damn!

189
00:10:00,745 --> 00:10:01,843
Crazy!

190
00:10:01,845 --> 00:10:04,383
Well, you know, after
my divorce was finalized,

191
00:10:04,385 --> 00:10:07,273
I switched real estate
companies, same job description,

192
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:09,899
just a fuck-ton more money.

193
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:13,437
And that is where I met my sweetheart.

194
00:10:13,439 --> 00:10:14,272
Aw!

195
00:10:16,042 --> 00:10:16,875
Cute.

196
00:10:17,957 --> 00:10:21,333
Could you believe it, she was
working as the receptionist?

197
00:10:21,335 --> 00:10:22,243
Are you kidding me?

198
00:10:22,245 --> 00:10:24,843
First thing I see when I
walk in there, I'm thinking,

199
00:10:24,845 --> 00:10:26,376
"Wow, this chick's hot."

200
00:10:26,378 --> 00:10:27,211
Right?

201
00:10:28,285 --> 00:10:30,143
So I gotta get in for a closer look.

202
00:10:30,145 --> 00:10:33,273
I come up and that's when
I see the memento card

203
00:10:33,275 --> 00:10:35,543
she's got hanging behind
her and it's got a picture

204
00:10:35,545 --> 00:10:37,843
of a sold house on it and
it says, "If you liked it..."

205
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,840
"If you liked it you
should've put a ring on it."

206
00:10:40,842 --> 00:10:43,163
(laughs)

207
00:10:43,165 --> 00:10:46,356
I mean, for me it was
love at first sight.

208
00:10:46,358 --> 00:10:47,820
And for me it was love at...

209
00:10:47,822 --> 00:10:49,513
About the 10th sight?

210
00:10:50,113 --> 00:10:50,983
(laughs)

211
00:10:50,985 --> 00:10:53,113
I wanna see your ring.

212
00:10:53,115 --> 00:10:53,948
Sure.

213
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,983
Ooh, well done, Eric.

214
00:10:57,985 --> 00:10:58,816
Thank you.

215
00:10:58,818 --> 00:11:01,077
We'll be married end of next year.

216
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:03,183
Oh, congratulations!

217
00:11:03,185 --> 00:11:05,043
That's really great, man.

218
00:11:05,045 --> 00:11:06,520
Thank you, thank you.

219
00:11:06,522 --> 00:11:08,163
You know what the best part is...

220
00:11:08,165 --> 00:11:10,703
She's got a 12-year-old
daughter named Emily.

221
00:11:10,705 --> 00:11:12,503
So we're gonna be like a real family.

222
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,073
Oh, that's awesome, I'm
so happy for you, guys.

223
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:16,013
[Eric and Monica] Thank you.

224
00:11:16,015 --> 00:11:17,483
Where's the kiddo now?

225
00:11:17,485 --> 00:11:19,073
Oh, she's in her room,
watching all of the

226
00:11:19,075 --> 00:11:20,923
Lord of the Rings films.

227
00:11:20,925 --> 00:11:22,903
It's her birthday tomorrow.

228
00:11:22,905 --> 00:11:24,053
Nice.

229
00:11:24,055 --> 00:11:25,271
(doorbell rings)

230
00:11:25,273 --> 00:11:26,184
Ooh!

231
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,126
That must be the Chinese food!

232
00:11:28,128 --> 00:11:29,295
[Jenna] Yay!

233
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,577
[Jenna] This smells so amazing.

234
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:37,013
[Eric] Guys, this is Emily.

235
00:11:37,015 --> 00:11:37,846
[Emily] Hi, everyone.

236
00:11:37,848 --> 00:11:39,113
[Jenna] Hi, Emily.

237
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,987
- Hi, mom.
- Aw, you're so adorable!

238
00:11:41,989 --> 00:11:43,473
[Monica] And some veggies, please.

239
00:11:43,475 --> 00:11:45,333
So, Emily, how is the movie?

240
00:11:45,335 --> 00:11:46,233
Oh, TD!

241
00:11:46,235 --> 00:11:48,205
I'm doing a Lord of the Rings marathon.

242
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,013
TD means To Die.

243
00:11:50,015 --> 00:11:52,285
Yeah, I know, trust me.

244
00:11:52,287 --> 00:11:53,288
[Jenna] Oh, you do?

245
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,371
(chuckles)

246
00:11:54,373 --> 00:11:56,583
How is the new tablet working
out with the headphones?

247
00:11:56,585 --> 00:11:57,543
Oh, great.

248
00:11:57,545 --> 00:11:58,643
[Eric] Excellent.

249
00:11:58,645 --> 00:12:00,145
This is for you.
You want some of this?

250
00:12:00,147 --> 00:12:00,978
Uh-huh.

251
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,444
(creepy music)

252
00:12:02,446 --> 00:12:04,173
[Eric] How about some chicken?

253
00:12:04,175 --> 00:12:05,848
Yeah.
And veggies, please.

254
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,303
[Eric] All right, Mom
says you gotta have veggies.

255
00:12:08,305 --> 00:12:09,981
Throw some of those on your plate.

256
00:12:09,983 --> 00:12:11,144
Okay, okay.

257
00:12:11,146 --> 00:12:12,687
(chuckles)

258
00:12:14,129 --> 00:12:15,820
[Jason] Is that dead fish?

259
00:12:16,993 --> 00:12:19,614
(laughs)

260
00:12:21,023 --> 00:12:22,973
(rumbling)

261
00:12:23,881 --> 00:12:26,006
(mellow music)

262
00:12:27,358 --> 00:12:29,191
[Jason] Light it up.

263
00:12:30,611 --> 00:12:32,610
Don't be stingy.

264
00:12:32,612 --> 00:12:34,830
(chuckles)

265
00:12:34,832 --> 00:12:37,108
I'm so glad you guys could make it.

266
00:12:38,935 --> 00:12:40,723
It's about time, right?

267
00:12:40,725 --> 00:12:41,558
It is.

268
00:12:46,045 --> 00:12:47,103
Like it?

269
00:12:47,105 --> 00:12:51,263
Oh, man, that's some
good shit right there!

270
00:12:51,265 --> 00:12:52,815
Nothing like that over in Iraq.

271
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:55,683
[Eric] No? What do they deal over there?

272
00:12:55,685 --> 00:12:56,638
Mainly weapons.

273
00:12:57,705 --> 00:13:00,221
I mean, they have some weed,
heroin and amphetamines,

274
00:13:00,223 --> 00:13:02,713
but let me tell you, they
ain't got weed like that!

275
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,807
More drugs, less guns, I say.

276
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:05,756
[Jenna] Good.

277
00:13:05,758 --> 00:13:06,828
I mean, really...

278
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,423
Look at this room, okay?

279
00:13:08,425 --> 00:13:11,032
We've got four completely
different human beings,

280
00:13:11,034 --> 00:13:13,663
but we all get along.

281
00:13:13,665 --> 00:13:15,741
You know, we got the crazy military guy

282
00:13:15,743 --> 00:13:19,583
who's braver than any
son-of-a-bitch I've ever met.

283
00:13:19,585 --> 00:13:23,103
We've got the lovely and
caring kindergarten teacher

284
00:13:23,105 --> 00:13:26,793
shaping the future of this nation.

285
00:13:26,795 --> 00:13:31,483
We've got my sexy
receptionist-artist soon-to-be wife,

286
00:13:31,485 --> 00:13:33,607
who couldn't hurt a fly.

287
00:13:33,609 --> 00:13:35,659
And, you know, you got the asshole.

288
00:13:35,661 --> 00:13:36,942
(laughs)

289
00:13:36,944 --> 00:13:39,196
Legit, you guys are here,
but I'm already thinking

290
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:40,393
about my next deal.

291
00:13:40,395 --> 00:13:41,226
You know...

292
00:13:41,228 --> 00:13:44,905
But the fact is we all get along.

293
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,561
And I just don't understand why the

294
00:13:46,563 --> 00:13:48,828
world can't just get along like that.

295
00:13:49,437 --> 00:13:51,113
Oh, you guys know, it's because

296
00:13:51,115 --> 00:13:52,738
of the different ideologies, man.

297
00:13:54,173 --> 00:13:59,043
You see, America, with all
its flaws, still stands

298
00:13:59,045 --> 00:14:01,203
for freedom and the pursuit of happiness.

299
00:14:01,205 --> 00:14:04,293
Our ideology here is to
create an environment for man

300
00:14:04,295 --> 00:14:08,640
to give them a shot, not
a guarantee, but a shot.

301
00:14:08,642 --> 00:14:10,803
A shot to become and
evolve into the person they

302
00:14:10,805 --> 00:14:13,233
really wanna be, you
know, self-determination,

303
00:14:13,235 --> 00:14:15,488
freedom of expression,
all that good stuff.

304
00:14:16,735 --> 00:14:20,263
But on the other hand,
we've got radical, crazy-ass

305
00:14:20,265 --> 00:14:23,232
Islamic terrorists who don't
give a shit about freedom.

306
00:14:23,823 --> 00:14:25,806
They only care about establishing a global

307
00:14:25,808 --> 00:14:27,320
totalitarian caliphate.

308
00:14:28,015 --> 00:14:29,511
A what?

309
00:14:29,513 --> 00:14:31,593
(laughs)

310
00:14:31,595 --> 00:14:33,393
A caliphate, man.

311
00:14:33,395 --> 00:14:36,433
You know, a caliphate
means, it's an Islamic

312
00:14:36,435 --> 00:14:38,533
world with total control.

313
00:14:38,535 --> 00:14:42,373
They reject democracy, they
reject human rights values,

314
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,253
they don't give a fuck.

315
00:14:44,255 --> 00:14:47,453
I just don't understand why
anyone would wanna do that.

316
00:14:47,455 --> 00:14:49,538
(laughs)

317
00:14:53,615 --> 00:14:56,103
Because it's their ideology, man.

318
00:14:56,105 --> 00:14:58,213
They truly believe the end times are here,

319
00:14:58,215 --> 00:15:00,615
and they believe that
they're part of some cosmic

320
00:15:00,617 --> 00:15:02,103
struggle, and, of course...

321
00:15:02,105 --> 00:15:04,813
Of course, these assholes
are convinced they're

322
00:15:04,815 --> 00:15:08,988
the good guys, and with
the help of Allah...

323
00:15:11,395 --> 00:15:13,786
They're gonna defeat all
the enemies of Islam in a

324
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,353
final climactic battle.

325
00:15:15,355 --> 00:15:17,443
And let me tell you something,
rest assured they are

326
00:15:17,445 --> 00:15:20,081
determined to use the
sword until everybody

327
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,638
is a Muslim and obeys sharia law.

328
00:15:23,611 --> 00:15:25,513
[Eric] Sharia law, that I heard of.

329
00:15:25,515 --> 00:15:26,346
Yeah.

330
00:15:26,348 --> 00:15:27,456
You see what I mean?

331
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,243
Two different ideologies
opposed to each other,

332
00:15:29,245 --> 00:15:31,253
and that's why we have war, my friends.

333
00:15:31,255 --> 00:15:33,663
Yeah, different ideologies.

334
00:15:33,665 --> 00:15:36,530
It does make a lot of sense.

335
00:15:38,455 --> 00:15:40,283
It is so screwed up.

336
00:15:40,285 --> 00:15:43,533
So, speaking of ideologies...

337
00:15:43,535 --> 00:15:45,403
What's you guys' ideology?

338
00:15:45,405 --> 00:15:48,891
What's the most important
thing on the planet to you?

339
00:15:50,335 --> 00:15:52,353
[Jason] Be all you can be.

340
00:15:52,355 --> 00:15:54,523
Yeah, okay, but what
does that like really mean?

341
00:15:54,525 --> 00:15:57,053
You gotta follow your heart.

342
00:15:57,055 --> 00:15:59,723
You gotta follow your true inner feelings.

343
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:02,063
And you will ultimately
become all you can be.

344
00:16:02,065 --> 00:16:03,843
Give me that joint.

345
00:16:03,845 --> 00:16:05,173
Give me that.

346
00:16:05,175 --> 00:16:06,696
Your highest self.

347
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:09,463
(laughs)

348
00:16:09,465 --> 00:16:11,703
Sounds like someone's
been drinking too much

349
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:12,998
of the army kool-aid.

350
00:16:14,525 --> 00:16:15,450
What about you, Jenna?

351
00:16:15,452 --> 00:16:16,427
What do you think?

352
00:16:16,827 --> 00:16:21,178
Oh, I don't know, I don't
usually ponder stuff like that.

353
00:16:25,725 --> 00:16:30,333
But I would say I am looking
forward to getting married...

354
00:16:30,891 --> 00:16:32,583
(moaning)
(laughing)

355
00:16:33,045 --> 00:16:35,313
Having a family.

356
00:16:35,315 --> 00:16:38,290
Good kids is one of the
most important things.

357
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:40,203
That is important.

358
00:16:40,205 --> 00:16:42,283
What about freedom?

359
00:16:42,285 --> 00:16:43,512
Or happiness?

360
00:16:45,525 --> 00:16:46,826
Or love?

361
00:16:46,828 --> 00:16:48,333
Or health?

362
00:16:48,335 --> 00:16:50,278
Well, maybe.

363
00:16:51,108 --> 00:16:53,227
Maybe it's a combination
of all those things.

364
00:16:53,229 --> 00:16:55,453
But first you need to have life

365
00:16:55,455 --> 00:16:56,918
before you can have anything.

366
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,447
And that life needs to be free,

367
00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:01,811
then it can pursue happiness.

368
00:17:02,293 --> 00:17:06,043
Right, like life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness.

369
00:17:06,045 --> 00:17:08,063
That sounds familiar, right?

370
00:17:08,065 --> 00:17:08,896
Bingo!

371
00:17:08,898 --> 00:17:12,306
Declaration of Independence,
a very clever document!

372
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,269
Let me ask you this, since
we're talking about ideologies

373
00:17:17,271 --> 00:17:19,870
and the meaning of life
and all that stuff...

374
00:17:21,445 --> 00:17:23,763
Have you guys ever tried DMT?

375
00:17:23,765 --> 00:17:25,403
You mean the spirit molecule?

376
00:17:25,405 --> 00:17:26,523
[Eric] Yes, sir.

377
00:17:26,525 --> 00:17:27,358
No, sir.

378
00:17:27,967 --> 00:17:31,130
But I have heard a lot about
it from my military buddies

379
00:17:31,132 --> 00:17:34,033
and it's definitely on my bucket list.

380
00:17:34,035 --> 00:17:35,763
How about you, Jenna?

381
00:17:35,765 --> 00:17:36,613
Nope.

382
00:17:36,615 --> 00:17:40,343
Never tried it, but a friend
of mine told me about it.

383
00:17:40,345 --> 00:17:43,846
She said it was the most
amazing experience ever.

384
00:17:43,848 --> 00:17:45,883
It is.

385
00:17:45,885 --> 00:17:46,787
Actually.

386
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:48,443
You tried it?

387
00:17:48,445 --> 00:17:49,803
[Monica] Twice.

388
00:17:49,805 --> 00:17:53,853
I mean, it is literally
the best experience

389
00:17:53,855 --> 00:17:56,793
you will have in your life.

390
00:17:56,795 --> 00:18:00,623
It will change your point
of view on everything.

391
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:03,238
You're getting me all
fucking excited over here.

392
00:18:04,155 --> 00:18:06,178
Tell me more, man, how's the trip?

393
00:18:07,205 --> 00:18:08,713
I don't know.

394
00:18:08,715 --> 00:18:12,323
But I can tell you what
I felt and what I felt

395
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:15,393
was pure acceptance.

396
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:18,843
Legit, I felt pure love.

397
00:18:18,845 --> 00:18:21,588
I mean it's something you got
to experience for yourselves.

398
00:18:23,205 --> 00:18:24,213
Do you want to?

399
00:18:26,135 --> 00:18:27,351
Say that again?

400
00:18:28,255 --> 00:18:30,112
[Eric] Would you like to have this

401
00:18:30,114 --> 00:18:32,047
experience for yourself?

402
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:33,896
(dramatic music)

403
00:18:34,645 --> 00:18:36,023
(chuckles)

404
00:18:36,025 --> 00:18:37,158
Are you serious?

405
00:18:39,387 --> 00:18:42,068
A friend of mine happens
to be a very talented

406
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:47,070
drug designer and he mixed
up a bag for me last week.

407
00:18:47,605 --> 00:18:51,738
95% pure DMT...

408
00:18:52,581 --> 00:18:54,713
With a little extra kick for you.

409
00:18:54,715 --> 00:18:55,856
Whoa.

410
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,330
What's the extra kick?

411
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:00,797
Who cares?

412
00:19:01,343 --> 00:19:04,086
He told me about it, but
I'm not good with all that

413
00:19:04,088 --> 00:19:07,055
scientific gobbledygook,
but I can tell you

414
00:19:07,057 --> 00:19:09,638
that it works like a charm,

415
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,163
and it will open up your heart

416
00:19:12,165 --> 00:19:13,332
completely.

417
00:19:13,835 --> 00:19:15,209
What do you think, baby?

418
00:19:15,211 --> 00:19:16,119
You want some?

419
00:19:17,705 --> 00:19:20,083
I don't know, I'm a little scared.

420
00:19:20,085 --> 00:19:23,643
No, it's not dangerous at all.

421
00:19:23,645 --> 00:19:25,853
It's a natural product.

422
00:19:25,855 --> 00:19:30,633
Actually, DMT is what your
brain naturally releases

423
00:19:30,635 --> 00:19:32,061
when you dream.

424
00:19:32,063 --> 00:19:33,456
- Mmm.
- Mm-hm.

425
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,059
Yeah.

426
00:19:35,061 --> 00:19:36,063
Uh-huh.

427
00:19:36,065 --> 00:19:40,168
So, we've taken it twice, seriously.

428
00:19:42,475 --> 00:19:44,125
I definitely want to do it again.

429
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:46,518
[Jenna] Hm.

430
00:19:47,925 --> 00:19:49,725
What do you think, you guys, game?

431
00:19:52,385 --> 00:19:55,865
Jason, don't be a pussy!

432
00:19:55,867 --> 00:19:57,693
[Jason] Whoa, whoa, pussy?

433
00:19:57,695 --> 00:19:58,903
Oh!

434
00:19:58,905 --> 00:20:01,293
Don't push the puss.

435
00:20:01,295 --> 00:20:02,363
[Eric] I won't push it.

436
00:20:02,365 --> 00:20:03,696
Fuck it, let's do it...

437
00:20:03,698 --> 00:20:04,879
I won't fuck it either.

438
00:20:04,881 --> 00:20:05,940
Light that shit up.

439
00:20:05,942 --> 00:20:08,317

00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:24,083
Yeah, yeah.

507
00:27:24,085 --> 00:27:26,133
Hey, baby, where you been?

508
00:27:26,135 --> 00:27:27,813
Oh, I was just in the bathroom.

509
00:27:27,815 --> 00:27:28,648
I'm good.

510
00:27:31,035 --> 00:27:32,343
Hey, sweetie.

511
00:27:32,345 --> 00:27:33,176
Everything okay?

512
00:27:33,178 --> 00:27:34,486
How was the trip, sweetie?

513
00:27:34,488 --> 00:27:37,438
[Eric] Dude, it was fucking amazing!

514
00:27:39,835 --> 00:27:40,893
[Jason] Hm.

515
00:27:40,895 --> 00:27:43,290
I did it, guys, I became
a part of the entire

516
00:27:43,292 --> 00:27:46,673
collective unconsciousness.

517
00:27:46,675 --> 00:27:47,506
It was amazing.

518
00:27:47,508 --> 00:27:48,923
I wasn't even myself anymore.

519
00:27:48,925 --> 00:27:51,773
I was just this like
vibrating mass of light

520
00:27:51,775 --> 00:27:54,743
that got rid of everything bad in me.

521
00:27:54,745 --> 00:27:57,373
You know, and then my
heart completely opened up

522
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:00,613
and pure love just poured in.

523
00:28:00,615 --> 00:28:01,773
Wow.

524
00:28:01,775 --> 00:28:02,925
It was amazing, dude.

525
00:28:04,945 --> 00:28:07,153
What about you, babe, how was your trip?

526
00:28:07,155 --> 00:28:08,608
It was incredible.

527
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:13,065
I mean, I was propelled to this place

528
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:16,023
filled with colored rings.

529
00:28:16,025 --> 00:28:17,807
They engaged in...

530
00:28:18,115 --> 00:28:20,488
In an activity of some sort.

531
00:28:21,329 --> 00:28:24,953
Like a bright world of living

532
00:28:24,955 --> 00:28:29,005
Geometry, infinite spirit or something.

533
00:28:30,605 --> 00:28:33,288
I mean, I know it sounds weird, but...

534
00:28:33,612 --> 00:28:35,712
my heart opened...

535
00:28:36,439 --> 00:28:38,693
just like Eric said.

536
00:28:38,695 --> 00:28:43,136
And negativity just left me...

537
00:28:44,136 --> 00:28:47,361
And I felt pure love.

538
00:28:48,636 --> 00:28:51,027
(dramatic music)

539
00:28:52,335 --> 00:28:53,793
How was your experience?

540
00:28:55,909 --> 00:28:59,071
Oh, yeah, mine wasn't so great.

541
00:28:59,073 --> 00:29:01,481
It started off all right,
and I saw all kinds

542
00:29:01,483 --> 00:29:02,895
of beautiful shit, but...

543
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:08,447
Then everything suddenly
turned dark, and this

544
00:29:08,449 --> 00:29:12,136
black fucking smoke,
you know, like in Lost,

545
00:29:12,138 --> 00:29:13,828
freaking attacked me, man.

546
00:29:15,245 --> 00:29:18,158
I woke up and had to run to
the bathroom to throw up.

547
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:21,463
Oh, baby, I'm sorry to hear that.

548
00:29:21,465 --> 00:29:22,470
Are you feeling better?

549
00:29:22,472 --> 00:29:24,648
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am.

550
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:28,070
Sorry, I've never heard
of anyone having a bad trip

551
00:29:28,072 --> 00:29:28,930
on that stuff.

552
00:29:29,725 --> 00:29:31,976
Yeah, I was thinking,
maybe it was that something

553
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:34,193
extra your buddy mixed in there.

554
00:29:34,195 --> 00:29:35,028
I don't know.

555
00:29:36,085 --> 00:29:37,813
Yeah, maybe.

556
00:29:37,815 --> 00:29:40,023
Uh, beer, anybody?

557
00:29:40,025 --> 00:29:41,723
Yeah, I'll have one, thanks.

558
00:29:41,725 --> 00:29:43,275
Sounds great, thanks...

559
00:29:43,277 --> 00:29:45,110
[Monica] I'll have one.

560
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:49,663

[Jason] Oh, hey, Emily, what's up?

610
00:33:13,785 --> 00:33:15,293
How's the movie?

611
00:33:15,295 --> 00:33:16,408
Uh, great.

612
00:33:17,718 --> 00:33:19,643
What are you doing?

613
00:33:19,645 --> 00:33:20,633
Nothing.

614
00:33:20,635 --> 00:33:23,700
I'm just chatting online
with a friend of mine.

615
00:33:23,702 --> 00:33:25,542
Hm, you're funny.

616
00:33:26,334 --> 00:33:27,740
Yeah...

617
00:33:28,985 --> 00:33:30,698
And you're so beautiful, Emily.

618
00:33:31,862 --> 00:33:33,713
Oh, no, I'm not.

619
00:33:33,715 --> 00:33:34,971
What are you talking about?

620
00:33:34,973 --> 00:33:36,021
Of course you are.

621
00:33:36,023 --> 00:33:37,833
You're incredibly beautiful.

622
00:33:37,835 --> 00:33:38,993
Look at you!

623
00:33:38,995 --> 00:33:40,693
No, your girlfriend is beautiful.

624
00:33:40,695 --> 00:33:43,113
Yeah, well, that's true...

625
00:33:43,115 --> 00:33:46,503
But compared to you, you are perfect.

626
00:33:46,505 --> 00:33:47,861
Come here for a second.

627
00:33:47,863 --> 00:33:49,179
(creepy music)

628
00:33:49,185 --> 00:33:51,185
Oh, come on, I'm not gonna bite you.

629
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,298
Okay.

630
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,178
Good.

631
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,339
Roll up your shirt a little bit

632
00:33:56,341 --> 00:33:57,883
so I can see your belly button.

633
00:33:59,183 --> 00:34:00,089
Uh.

634
00:34:00,091 --> 00:34:01,683
Oh, come on, just roll it up.

635
00:34:01,685 --> 00:34:03,168
I wanna show you something.

636
00:34:04,635 --> 00:34:08,921
Good, just a little bit higher,
just below your chest there.

637
00:34:08,923 --> 00:34:10,348
Nice.

638
00:34:12,262 --> 00:34:13,888
Now pull down your pajama pants.

639
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:16,052
Uh.

640
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,435
[Jason] Just a little
bit below your hip bones.

641
00:34:18,615 --> 00:34:19,448
Okay.

642
00:34:19,872 --> 00:34:21,313
Just a little further.

643
00:34:21,721 --> 00:34:22,553
(snorts)

644
00:34:22,555 --> 00:34:23,783
Wow!

645
00:34:23,785 --> 00:34:25,853
You are perfect.

646
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,655
You know, you could be a supermodel.

647
00:34:29,084 --> 00:34:30,978
Wait, wait, wait, hold on a second.

648
00:34:31,749 --> 00:34:35,518
Give me one of those supermodel
smiles, with some attitude.

649
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,753
(chuckles)

650
00:34:36,755 --> 00:34:37,620
Damn!

651
00:34:37,622 --> 00:34:38,725
Work it.

652
00:34:39,415 --> 00:34:41,615
Yeah, that's it, nice.

653
00:34:42,299 --> 00:34:43,132
Very nice.

654
00:34:43,826 --> 00:34:46,783
Now turn the mirror and look at yourself.

655
00:34:46,785 --> 00:34:47,618
Yeah.

656
00:34:48,925 --> 00:34:49,758
Wow!

657
00:34:50,891 --> 00:34:53,241
Look at your long brown beautiful hair.

658
00:34:55,072 --> 00:34:57,667
Your sexy flat tummy.

659
00:34:57,669 --> 00:34:59,108
You're silly.

660
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:01,021
And you're a supermodel.

661
00:35:01,023 --> 00:35:03,283
Uh... I'm gonna finish my movie now.

662
00:35:03,285 --> 00:35:05,482
Yeah, okay, you go do that.

663
00:35:16,332 --> 00:35:18,240

00:36:24,647 --> 00:36:27,122
We've got the crazy military guy.

681
00:36:27,124 --> 00:36:28,621
[Jason] How was the trip?

682
00:36:28,623 --> 00:36:31,814
[Eric] Dude, it was fucking amazing!

683
00:36:37,172 --> 00:36:38,630
(typing)

684
00:36:40,421 --> 00:36:41,254
(popping)

685
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:46,070
(typing)

686
00:36:47,354 --> 00:36:48,187
(popping)

687
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:53,803
(typing)

688
00:36:54,578 --> 00:36:55,411
(popping)

689
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,118
(music builds)

690
00:37:11,651 --> 00:37:13,492
(typing)

691
00:37:15,192 --> 00:37:16,025
(popping)

692
00:37:20,573 --> 00:37:21,581
Angry.

693
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:23,572
(popping)

694
00:37:25,914 --> 00:37:26,747
(popping)

695
00:37:31,506 --> 00:37:32,339
(popping)

696
00:37:35,514 --> 00:37:36,347
(popping)

697
00:37:39,556 --> 00:37:41,964
(music builds)

698
00:37:42,265 --> 00:37:43,098
Fuck!

699
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,892
You're fucking right!

700
00:37:46,901 --> 00:37:48,026
Motherfucker!

701
00:37:48,525 --> 00:37:49,358
(popping)

702
00:37:54,341 --> 00:37:55,883
(Jenna laughs)

703
00:37:55,885 --> 00:37:56,973
Speaking of lunch.

704
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:57,878
You hungry at all?

705
00:37:57,887 --> 00:37:59,293
You want any food?

706
00:37:59,295 --> 00:38:03,310
We've got some snacks for you
chips, peanuts, chocolate.

707
00:38:03,312 --> 00:38:06,153
[Jenna] Oh, no, no, I'm stuffed, thanks.

708
00:38:06,155 --> 00:38:07,623
[Eric] It's not a problem.

709
00:38:07,625 --> 00:38:08,604
Hey, what's going on?

710
00:38:08,606 --> 00:38:10,170
What are you guys talking about?

711
00:38:10,172 --> 00:38:12,170
Just offering your missus some snacks.

712
00:38:12,172 --> 00:38:13,273
(chuckles)

713
00:38:13,275 --> 00:38:14,483
Snacks?

714
00:38:14,485 --> 00:38:15,316
Hm.

715
00:38:15,318 --> 00:38:17,301
You know, Jenna doesn't
need to be catered to,

716
00:38:17,303 --> 00:38:18,545
especially not by you, brother.

717
00:38:20,145 --> 00:38:22,325
Um, okay, buddy.

718
00:38:22,327 --> 00:38:24,955
Oh, no, don't buddy me, man.

719
00:38:26,785 --> 00:38:28,173
Honey, what's wrong?

720
00:38:28,175 --> 00:38:29,113
Nothing.

721
00:38:29,115 --> 00:38:30,969
Go on, what were you guys talking about?

722
00:38:30,971 --> 00:38:32,260
We were talking about...

723
00:38:32,262 --> 00:38:33,828
Dude, seriously, man.

724
00:38:35,265 --> 00:38:36,828
I was asking my girlfriend.

725
00:38:37,745 --> 00:38:39,213
Why you always cut everybody off?

726
00:38:39,215 --> 00:38:40,298
It's rude, man.

727
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:42,143
Okay.

728
00:38:42,145 --> 00:38:44,072
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

729
00:38:44,074 --> 00:38:46,178
Go on, Jenna, what were you saying?

730
00:38:49,095 --> 00:38:52,363
Um, yeah, so we were
talking about never discussing

731
00:38:52,365 --> 00:38:54,433
politics and religion at work.

732
00:38:54,435 --> 00:38:56,033
I see.

733
00:38:56,035 --> 00:38:57,202
You agree with that?

734
00:38:58,575 --> 00:39:00,513
Yeah, I think it's probably a good idea.

735
00:39:00,515 --> 00:39:01,932
[Jason] And why is that?

736
00:39:02,495 --> 00:39:04,796
Because, Jason, these
could be sensitive subjects

737
00:39:04,798 --> 00:39:06,808
for people and you might offend someone.

738
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:08,703
You think I might get offended?

739
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:12,233
I don't know.

740
00:39:12,235 --> 00:39:13,633
You don't know?

741
00:39:13,635 --> 00:39:15,143
(chuckles)

742
00:39:17,122 --> 00:39:19,405
Dude, aren't we something
like best friends, man?

743
00:39:20,345 --> 00:39:22,373
Yeah, I think so.

744
00:39:22,375 --> 00:39:24,233
But you have no idea
if you can talk to me

745
00:39:24,235 --> 00:39:25,513
about religion or politics?

746
00:39:25,515 --> 00:39:28,163
I'm just saying, maybe
we're not as good of friends

747
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:28,996
as we thought?

748
00:39:28,998 --> 00:39:31,343
Maybe we're not best friends, at all.

749
00:39:31,345 --> 00:39:32,856
Baby, what are you doing?

750
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:36,163
You gonna answer me?

751
00:39:37,595 --> 00:39:39,623
I don't know what to say.

752
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:41,614
You don't know what to say?

753
00:39:41,616 --> 00:39:43,568
You're a sneaky motherfucker, aren't you?

754
00:39:44,502 --> 00:39:45,333
What?

755
00:39:45,335 --> 00:39:46,873
[Jason] You heard me.

756
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:48,428
Why would you say that to me?

757
00:39:49,493 --> 00:39:51,558
Do you look me in the
eye and tell me you have

758
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,427
no idea what I'm talking about?

759
00:39:54,362 --> 00:39:57,273
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

760
00:39:57,275 --> 00:39:58,108
Is that right?

761
00:40:05,671 --> 00:40:07,004
What the fuck?

762
00:40:13,255 --> 00:40:15,583
Be careful with that,
Jason, it's a powerful tool.

763
00:40:15,585 --> 00:40:17,373
It holds three-inch nails, bro.

764
00:40:17,375 --> 00:40:19,793
What the fuck are you doing?

765
00:40:19,795 --> 00:40:20,628
Okay, buddy.

766
00:40:21,975 --> 00:40:22,806
Let's think again.

767
00:40:22,808 --> 00:40:24,383
Isn't there anything you wanna tell me?

768
00:40:24,385 --> 00:40:26,033
Baby, what are you doing?

769
00:40:26,035 --> 00:40:28,903
Oh, I'm sorry, is there
something you wanna tell me?

770
00:40:28,905 --> 00:40:29,736
No!

771
00:40:29,738 --> 00:40:30,569
Jason.

772
00:40:30,571 --> 00:40:32,546
One more word and I'm gonna shoot you

773
00:40:32,548 --> 00:40:33,379
in your fucking face.

774
00:40:33,381 --> 00:40:34,382
Hey, don't talk to her like that.

775
00:40:34,384 --> 00:40:35,663
What the fuck is wrong with you?

776
00:40:35,665 --> 00:40:37,723
You like my girlfriend, don't you, bro?

777
00:40:37,725 --> 00:40:38,556
What?

778
00:40:38,558 --> 00:40:39,575
You heard me, man!

779
00:40:39,577 --> 00:40:41,170
Don't you fucking play innocent!

780
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:42,133
I know what's going on here.

781
00:40:42,135 --> 00:40:43,383
What the fuck are you talking about?

782
00:40:43,385 --> 00:40:44,566
There's nothing going on.

783
00:40:44,568 --> 00:40:46,832
You better fucking man up and admit it!

784
00:40:46,834 --> 00:40:47,665
Admit what?

785
00:40:47,667 --> 00:40:48,498
(thud!)

786
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,919
(screams)

787
00:40:49,921 --> 00:40:51,709
Are you fucking crazy?

788
00:40:51,711 --> 00:40:52,925
Stop it!

789
00:40:52,927 --> 00:40:53,758
Sit down!

790
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,591
Sit the fuck down!

791
00:40:54,593 --> 00:40:55,622
And don't you move again!

792
00:40:55,624 --> 00:40:56,708
You understand me?

793
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:57,541
Jason!

794
00:40:57,543 --> 00:40:58,374
Listen to me.

795
00:40:58,376 --> 00:41:00,248
You stay right where
you at and don't you

796
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,356
fucking move either!

797
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:03,417
(groans)

798
00:41:05,055 --> 00:41:07,060
I know you fucked my
girlfriend, but I wanna hear it

799
00:41:07,062 --> 00:41:07,893
from you now!

800
00:41:07,895 --> 00:41:09,203
What?

801
00:41:09,205 --> 00:41:11,043
You better fucking come
clean or I'll put one

802
00:41:11,045 --> 00:41:12,703
right in your motherfucking skull!

803
00:41:12,705 --> 00:41:14,843
What the fuck has
gotten into you, Jason?

804
00:41:14,845 --> 00:41:16,453
I've never laid a finger on her, ever!

805
00:41:16,455 --> 00:41:18,345
[Jason] You're lying to
me, you son of a bitch!

806
00:41:18,347 --> 00:41:20,253
No, he is telling the truth!

807
00:41:20,255 --> 00:41:22,023
I don't know why you
would even think that!

808
00:41:22,025 --> 00:41:23,343
Nothing happened between us.

809
00:41:23,345 --> 00:41:24,935
Stop lying to me the both of you!

810
00:41:24,937 --> 00:41:26,933
I'm not fucking stupid!

811
00:41:26,935 --> 00:41:28,553
This is your last chance to admit it.

812
00:41:28,555 --> 00:41:30,793
[Monica] Please, stop!

813
00:41:30,795 --> 00:41:31,626
One...

814
00:41:31,628 --> 00:41:33,502
- Please, please, please!
- Two...

815
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:35,532
- Three.
- Okay!

816
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:36,622
I'm sorry.

817
00:41:36,624 --> 00:41:38,338
Yes, we had sex, one time!

818
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,478
I fucking knew it!

819
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,570
Why would you say that,

820
00:41:41,572 --> 00:41:42,445
you know it's not true.

821
00:41:42,447 --> 00:41:44,626
Because I'm trying to
save my fucking life, Jenna!

822
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:46,334
Yeah, he just did.

823
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,058
(music builds)

824
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:49,891
(glass crashing)

825
00:41:49,893 --> 00:41:51,259
(thudding)

826
00:41:54,151 --> 00:41:55,659
(thudding)

827
00:41:57,717 --> 00:41:59,814
(groaning)

828
00:41:59,816 --> 00:42:01,847
No, no, don't!

829
00:42:01,849 --> 00:42:02,680
(thud!)

830
00:42:02,682 --> 00:42:04,582
(screams)

831
00:42:06,449 --> 00:42:07,280
(thud!)

832
00:42:07,282 --> 00:42:08,883
Jason, you're fucking paranoid!

833
00:42:08,885 --> 00:42:09,918
Please!

834
00:42:11,818 --> 00:42:13,575
(groaning)

835
00:42:13,577 --> 00:42:16,376
[Jason] Sit your ass
on that fucking chair!

836
00:42:16,378 --> 00:42:17,211
Relax!

837
00:42:21,269 --> 00:42:22,486
(sobbing)

838
00:42:23,303 --> 00:42:25,529
(screams)

839
00:42:26,078 --> 00:42:27,228
What the fuck, Jason?

840
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:28,286
[Jason] Shut your mouth!

841
00:42:28,288 --> 00:42:29,196
Jason, let her go!

842
00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:34,218
Okay.

843
00:42:35,435 --> 00:42:37,433
Now it's your turn to tell me the truth.

844
00:42:37,435 --> 00:42:41,393
Jason, we've been telling
you the truth this whole time!

845
00:42:41,395 --> 00:42:44,427
There has never been
anything between Eric and me.

846
00:42:44,429 --> 00:42:45,492
Uh-huh.

847
00:42:45,494 --> 00:42:47,183
Never!

848
00:42:47,185 --> 00:42:49,863
I love you, and only you.

849
00:42:49,865 --> 00:42:51,895
Yeah, that's what I thought too, but...

850
00:42:53,285 --> 00:42:55,143
things are obviously different now, so...

851
00:42:55,145 --> 00:42:58,803
No, nothing is different,
you're just confused.

852
00:42:58,805 --> 00:42:59,913
No, no, no, no.

853
00:42:59,915 --> 00:43:01,743
I'm not confused!

854
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,603
Quite the opposite, I've never seen things

855
00:43:03,605 --> 00:43:05,098
so fucking crystal clear!

856
00:43:11,407 --> 00:43:13,717
You lie to me one more fucking
time and I'm gonna shoot you

857
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:15,323
right in your fucking eye.

858
00:43:15,325 --> 00:43:17,148
You would never do that to me.

859
00:43:18,405 --> 00:43:19,953
You love me, don't you?

860
00:43:19,955 --> 00:43:20,788
One...

861
00:43:23,155 --> 00:43:24,680
Fucking two...

862
00:43:27,265 --> 00:43:28,230
Three!

863
00:43:28,232 --> 00:43:29,326
Fuck!

864
00:43:29,793 --> 00:43:31,025
Fuck!

865
00:43:34,635 --> 00:43:36,950
Jason, no, leave her alone!

866
00:43:36,952 --> 00:43:39,730
(screams)

867
00:43:39,732 --> 00:43:40,746
Stop!

868
00:43:40,748 --> 00:43:42,429
Jason, let her go!

869
00:43:42,431 --> 00:43:44,497
Please, let her go, please!

870
00:43:45,445 --> 00:43:46,853
[Eric] Jason, she can't breathe!

871
00:43:46,855 --> 00:43:47,688
Stop!

872
00:43:48,705 --> 00:43:50,321
(gasping)

873
00:43:51,321 --> 00:43:52,426
(coughing)

874
00:43:52,428 --> 00:43:53,928
[Jason] And?

875
00:43:54,902 --> 00:43:56,441
Are you ready to tell me the truth now?

876
00:43:56,443 --> 00:43:58,168
(dramatic music)

877
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:00,013
Stop it, are you fucking crazy?

878
00:44:00,015 --> 00:44:00,990
Stop!

879
00:44:00,992 --> 00:44:02,637
You're gonna kill her, man.

880
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:03,578
(screams)

881
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:04,413
Jason, please!

882
00:44:06,629 --> 00:44:08,219
(gasping)

883
00:44:08,221 --> 00:44:09,421
(coughing)

884
00:44:09,423 --> 00:44:11,273
[Jason] Are you gonna tell me now?

885
00:44:11,873 --> 00:44:12,839
No?

886
00:44:14,037 --> 00:44:15,363
No!
Stop!

887
00:44:15,365 --> 00:44:16,931
No, please! I admit it!

888
00:44:16,933 --> 00:44:19,325
[Jason] What, what did you say?

889
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:21,541
[Jenna] I admit it.

890
00:44:21,543 --> 00:44:23,516
(sobbing)

891
00:44:23,518 --> 00:44:25,613
[Jason] I thought you
said nothing happened.

892
00:44:25,615 --> 00:44:30,208
No, we had sex, once, just as Eric said.

893
00:44:31,889 --> 00:44:34,958
It was a mistake and we both regretted it.

894
00:44:37,735 --> 00:44:38,568
I'm sorry.

895
00:44:41,535 --> 00:44:42,624
(bangs window)

896
00:44:42,626 --> 00:44:44,101
(Eric whines)

897
00:44:46,027 --> 00:44:47,518
(bangs window)

898
00:44:48,245 --> 00:44:49,636
Okay, folks.

899
00:44:50,835 --> 00:44:52,278
I got a solution.

900
00:44:55,105 --> 00:44:57,038
There's only one way to make this even.

901
00:45:03,345 --> 00:45:05,723
You fucked my girlfriend...

902
00:45:05,725 --> 00:45:07,313
Now I'm gonna fuck yours.

903
00:45:07,315 --> 00:45:08,148
Fuck you!

904
00:45:10,585 --> 00:45:11,538
Monica, get up.

905
00:45:11,938 --> 00:45:12,769
Please.

906
00:45:12,771 --> 00:45:14,643
[Eric] Monica, don't do
it, don't do what he says!

907
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:17,003
Do not fucking touch her!

908
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:18,313
Do you hear me?

909
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:19,148
Don't touch her!

910
00:45:19,995 --> 00:45:22,138
Jason, leave her alone!

911
00:45:22,739 --> 00:45:24,450
[Eric] Jason, stop!

912
00:45:24,452 --> 00:45:26,267
Fuck, don't even think about it!

913
00:45:26,269 --> 00:45:27,719
(sobbing)

914
00:45:33,562 --> 00:45:35,473
Didn't I say get up?

915
00:45:35,475 --> 00:45:36,428
[Eric] Fuck you!

916
00:45:37,095 --> 00:45:39,763
[Jason] Just do what I say,
everybody's gonna be A-okay.

917
00:45:39,765 --> 00:45:40,667
Fuck you, Jason!

918
00:45:40,669 --> 00:45:42,008
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

919
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:43,013
[Jason] Oh, dude, really?

920
00:45:43,015 --> 00:45:44,004
Are you serious?

921
00:45:44,006 --> 00:45:45,168
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

922
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:47,143
(chuckles)

923
00:45:47,145 --> 00:45:49,763
Dude, I'm telling you, man,
one more fucking word from you

924
00:45:49,765 --> 00:45:52,480
and I swear to God you're
not gonna survive this, okay?

925
00:45:52,482 --> 00:45:53,313
[Eric] Fuck you!

926
00:45:53,315 --> 00:45:55,587
Do you want your future husband
to have a hole in his head

927
00:45:55,589 --> 00:45:56,926
or are you gonna do this for him?

928
00:45:56,928 --> 00:45:58,284
No, please!

929
00:45:58,286 --> 00:45:59,231
[Jason] Huh?

930
00:45:59,233 --> 00:46:00,630
- I'll do whatever you say.
- Yeah?

931
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:01,470
Monica, no!

932
00:46:01,472 --> 00:46:02,994
Don't fucking do it!

933
00:46:02,996 --> 00:46:04,573
Don't do anything he says, Monica.

934
00:46:04,575 --> 00:46:06,631
Don't fucking, please,
don't fucking do it!

935
00:46:06,633 --> 00:46:07,749
(Thud!)
(screams)

936
00:46:07,751 --> 00:46:08,590
(Thud!)

937
00:46:08,592 --> 00:46:09,465
(screams)

938
00:46:09,467 --> 00:46:10,736
Stop!

939
00:46:10,738 --> 00:46:12,907
Stop, you can have me!

940
00:46:12,909 --> 00:46:14,237
You can have me.

941
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:16,341
You see, that wasn't so hard, was it?

942
00:46:16,343 --> 00:46:17,803
That was pretty easy.

943
00:46:17,805 --> 00:46:19,413
And look, look at here.

944
00:46:19,415 --> 00:46:20,863
He's gonna be fine.

945
00:46:20,865 --> 00:46:22,833
You don't have to worry about him.

946
00:46:22,835 --> 00:46:24,533
Yeah, yeah, you stand right there

947
00:46:24,535 --> 00:46:25,653
in the middle of the room.

948
00:46:25,655 --> 00:46:28,133
Right here in front of Eric.

949
00:46:28,135 --> 00:46:29,783
Yeah, that's it.

950
00:46:29,785 --> 00:46:31,285
Now turn and face me.

951
00:46:34,755 --> 00:46:35,898
Take off your dress.

952
00:46:37,025 --> 00:46:38,965
[Eric] Monica, please,
don't fucking do it!

953
00:46:38,967 --> 00:46:41,158
Please, don't fucking do it!

954
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,192
That's it.

955
00:46:50,716 --> 00:46:52,299
Wow, you're pretty.

956
00:46:54,341 --> 00:46:56,033
Take off your bra, Monica.

957
00:46:57,241 --> 00:46:58,072
It's okay.

958
00:46:58,074 --> 00:46:59,396
[Monica] Please.

959
00:46:59,398 --> 00:47:00,398
It's okay.

960
00:47:08,787 --> 00:47:10,323
Wow.

961
00:47:10,325 --> 00:47:11,763
Very, very nice, Monica.

962
00:47:11,765 --> 00:47:13,238
Now take off your panties.

963
00:47:14,875 --> 00:47:15,708
Take them off.

964
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:20,638
That's fucking hot right there.

965
00:47:21,893 --> 00:47:22,775
Huh?

966
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:25,949
What do you think, Jenna?

967
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:27,962
Look at her.

968
00:47:27,964 --> 00:47:29,876
Isn't she hot?

969
00:47:29,878 --> 00:47:31,196
Huh?

970
00:47:31,198 --> 00:47:32,059
Look.

971
00:47:32,061 --> 00:47:34,321
No, don't look at me, look at her, look.

972
00:47:34,329 --> 00:47:36,163
Isn't she hot?

973
00:47:36,165 --> 00:47:38,487
Oh, come on, you like her too, don't you?

974
00:47:38,489 --> 00:47:39,335
Don't you?

975
00:47:39,337 --> 00:47:41,063
You wouldn't mind getting it
on with her either, would you?

976
00:47:41,065 --> 00:47:42,143
Huh?

977
00:47:42,145 --> 00:47:43,372
I knew it.

978
00:47:43,989 --> 00:47:44,843
I knew it.

979
00:47:45,001 --> 00:47:45,901
I knew it.

980
00:47:47,095 --> 00:47:48,673
Yeah.

981
00:47:48,675 --> 00:47:51,723
Monica, come lay down
on the couch over here.

982
00:47:51,725 --> 00:47:52,753
Don't you fucking touch her!

983
00:47:52,755 --> 00:47:55,304
You lay a finger on her
and I'm gonna kill you!

984
00:47:55,306 --> 00:47:56,403
It's a fucking promise!

985
00:47:56,405 --> 00:47:59,633
I swear to God, man,
first of all, first of all,

986
00:47:59,635 --> 00:48:02,213
don't promise something
you can't keep, okay?

987
00:48:02,215 --> 00:48:05,083
And second, second!

988
00:48:05,085 --> 00:48:06,878
Don't be so fucking dramatic!

989
00:48:07,725 --> 00:48:09,673
You're the one that touched
my girlfriend first,

990
00:48:09,675 --> 00:48:11,633
and I didn't fucking
kill you either, did I?

991
00:48:11,635 --> 00:48:13,853
I never fucking laid a finger on her!

992
00:48:13,855 --> 00:48:15,293
Oh, boy, oh boy!

993
00:48:15,295 --> 00:48:17,110
Here we go, here we go, here we go!

994
00:48:17,112 --> 00:48:19,623
With all the fucking craziness!

995
00:48:19,625 --> 00:48:22,963
Lying-ass, motherfucker,
you're lying to me!

996
00:48:22,965 --> 00:48:25,883
You just let your little
sweetheart Monica make up

997
00:48:25,885 --> 00:48:27,403
for your fucking mistakes.

998
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:30,179
Monica, come over here
and lie down on the couch.

999
00:48:30,181 --> 00:48:31,213
And stop crying.

1000
00:48:31,215 --> 00:48:32,048
Get over here.

1001
00:48:33,102 --> 00:48:34,883
There you go.

1002
00:48:34,885 --> 00:48:36,120
Fuck you!

1003
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:36,955
Fuck you!

1004
00:48:40,347 --> 00:48:43,155
(music intensifies)

1005
00:48:44,723 --> 00:48:46,169
Motherfucker!

1006
00:48:46,171 --> 00:48:47,379
Son of a bitch!

1007
00:48:48,988 --> 00:48:49,819
(Thud!)

1008
00:48:49,821 --> 00:48:51,779
No, you fucking monster!

1009
00:48:51,781 --> 00:48:53,731
Monica, Monica!

1010
00:48:54,419 --> 00:48:56,518
You fucking killed her!

1011
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,065
- Wake up.
- You fucking killed her!

1012
00:48:58,067 --> 00:48:59,164
Wake the fuck up.

1013
00:48:59,166 --> 00:48:59,999
Wake up!

1014
00:49:00,958 --> 00:49:02,657
Fucking shit!

1015
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,106
[Eric] You're fucking dead, you hear me?

1016
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:07,423
Dude, what are you
babbling about now for?

1017
00:49:07,425 --> 00:49:08,413
What, what?

1018
00:49:08,415 --> 00:49:09,613
Look at you!

1019
00:49:09,615 --> 00:49:10,553
You got nothing.

1020
00:49:10,555 --> 00:49:11,386
No power.

1021
00:49:11,388 --> 00:49:12,903
Zero, bro!

1022
00:49:12,905 --> 00:49:13,763
Zero!

1023
00:49:13,765 --> 00:49:15,093
And I'm not even, you know what?

1024
00:49:15,095 --> 00:49:16,848
I'm not even fucking done here yet.

1025
00:49:17,825 --> 00:49:18,658
Huh?

1026
00:49:19,613 --> 00:49:20,863
How about that?

1027
00:49:21,368 --> 00:49:22,590
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

1028
00:49:23,024 --> 00:49:24,474
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

1029
00:49:25,007 --> 00:49:26,165
(panting)

1030
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:29,548
Monica!

1031
00:49:30,935 --> 00:49:32,483
Fuck you, you fucking bastard!

1032
00:49:32,485 --> 00:49:34,401
I'm gonna kill you, you fucking monster!

1033
00:49:35,417 --> 00:49:37,625
(music builds)

1034
00:49:38,412 --> 00:49:40,815
[Jason] Oh, yes, yes, yes!

1035
00:49:40,817 --> 00:49:41,842
Fuck you!

1036
00:49:41,844 --> 00:49:42,677
Fucking monster!

1037
00:49:43,003 --> 00:49:43,836
Monica!

1038
00:49:44,475 --> 00:49:45,631
Monica!

1039
00:49:45,633 --> 00:49:46,574
Fuck you!

1040
00:49:46,576 --> 00:49:48,107
I'm gonna destroy you!

1041
00:49:48,109 --> 00:49:49,948
Oh, my God!

1042
00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:51,438
Now we're even.

1043
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,703
Oh, my God!

1044
00:49:52,705 --> 00:49:56,676
Eric, that was, amazing, bro.

1045
00:49:56,678 --> 00:49:58,133
[Eric] Fuck you, you
fucking piece of shit!

1046
00:49:58,135 --> 00:50:00,014
You're never gonna get away with this.

1047
00:50:00,016 --> 00:50:01,493
I'm never gonna get away with this?

1048
00:50:01,495 --> 00:50:03,493
I think I just did, man.

1049
00:50:03,495 --> 00:50:04,843
You're the one who got caught.

1050
00:50:04,845 --> 00:50:05,838
Look at you!

1051
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,293
What can you do?

1052
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:08,243
Nothing!

1053
00:50:08,245 --> 00:50:09,403
Zero!

1054
00:50:09,405 --> 00:50:10,676
You have no power, dude!

1055
00:50:10,678 --> 00:50:13,953
Wow, dude, you're so delusional, man!

1056
00:50:13,955 --> 00:50:15,573
It's embarrassing.

1057
00:50:15,575 --> 00:50:16,773
It really is.

1058
00:50:16,775 --> 00:50:19,614
It's pathetic.

1059
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:21,798
You should be ashamed of yourself.

1060
00:50:23,826 --> 00:50:25,196
Monica.

1061
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,871
(uneasy music)

1062
00:50:32,788 --> 00:50:36,679
(typing)

1063
00:50:45,846 --> 00:50:46,679

(popping)

1066
00:50:56,751 --> 00:50:57,584
Wow.

1067
00:50:59,476 --> 00:51:02,634
(typing)

1068
00:51:06,993 --> 00:51:07,826
(popping)

1069
00:51:12,465 --> 00:51:15,113
What the fuck is wrong with him?

1070
00:51:15,115 --> 00:51:16,537
I have no idea.

1071
00:51:16,539 --> 00:51:18,322
I've never seen him like this.

1072
00:51:20,235 --> 00:51:23,398
Hey, what's going on, guys?

1073
00:51:24,385 --> 00:51:25,378
Just hanging out?

1074
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:27,600
That's nice.

1075
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:41,042
Hm, that's...

1076
00:51:41,725 --> 00:51:42,558
Nice.

1077
00:51:44,975 --> 00:51:46,375
That would be something new.

1078
00:51:47,365 --> 00:51:48,565
What do you think, Eric?

1079
00:51:50,185 --> 00:51:51,318
Any last words?

1080
00:51:52,835 --> 00:51:53,938
Fuck you, Jason.

1081
00:51:54,917 --> 00:51:56,163
Really?

1082
00:51:56,165 --> 00:51:59,955
I think it would make a lot
more sense if you would beg or

1083
00:51:59,957 --> 00:52:03,273
ask for forgiveness or something!

1084
00:52:03,275 --> 00:52:04,275
Go to hell, Jason.

1085
00:52:04,983 --> 00:52:06,159
Okay.

1086
00:52:06,161 --> 00:52:07,952
[Eric] Go to fucking hell!

1087
00:52:12,505 --> 00:52:14,332
[Jenna] Jason, leave him alone!

1088
00:52:14,334 --> 00:52:16,858
Oh, God, now you're talking again.

1089
00:52:19,605 --> 00:52:24,418
It's your last chance to
consider your last words.

1090
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:27,543
You are the biggest piece
of shit I've ever seen.

1091
00:52:27,545 --> 00:52:29,935
You're a little fucking bitch, Jason.

1092
00:52:29,937 --> 00:52:31,423
A little fucking bitch.

1093
00:52:31,425 --> 00:52:36,241
Narcissist, evil motherfucker,
that's what you are.

1094
00:52:36,243 --> 00:52:37,358
Wow!

1095
00:52:38,595 --> 00:52:41,188
You know, after all these years, man...

1096
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:44,099
I really thought we were best friends.

1097
00:52:44,101 --> 00:52:44,979
[Eric] Fuck you!

1098
00:52:44,981 --> 00:52:46,833
You're fucking pathetic!

1099
00:52:47,191 --> 00:52:48,024
You see?

1100
00:52:49,656 --> 00:52:51,110
You see?

1101
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:53,598
The real truth finally comes out.

1102
00:52:54,617 --> 00:52:56,821
Jason, please, don't hurt anyone else.

1103
00:52:56,823 --> 00:52:58,667
Why did we pretend for so long?

1104
00:53:03,215 --> 00:53:05,303
Well, I'm gonna enjoy this.

1105
00:53:05,305 --> 00:53:06,452
[Jenna] Don't do it!

1106

Oh, I feel good.

00:53:56,285 --> 00:53:57,935
I gotta tell you something, Jenna.

1117
00:53:57,937 --> 00:53:59,637
I've never felt more...

1118
00:54:02,055 --> 00:54:03,188
Powerful...

1119
00:54:05,378 --> 00:54:06,803
In my entire life.

1120
00:54:06,805 --> 00:54:08,978
I mean, I feel completely free.

1121
00:54:09,925 --> 00:54:11,108
Can you smell that?

Mmm.

1126
00:54:48,087 --> 00:54:49,503
Look at this.

1127
00:54:50,345 --> 00:54:52,567
Oh, my God!

1128
00:54:53,475 --> 00:54:55,213
Oh, my God!

1129
00:54:55,215 --> 00:54:57,748
I'm fucking getting more powerful...

1130
00:55:00,045 --> 00:55:00,968
By the minute.

1131
00:55:01,842 --> 00:55:04,638
You've gone completely crazy.

1132
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:05,471
I've gone crazy?

1133
00:55:05,473 --> 00:55:06,304
Okay.

1134
00:55:06,306 --> 00:55:08,086
Look, let me tell you something:

1135
00:55:08,088 --> 00:55:11,291
What happened here, right here, tonight...

1136
00:55:14,295 --> 00:55:15,523
Was not my fault.

1137
00:55:15,525 --> 00:55:16,356
Okay?

1138
00:55:16,358 --> 00:55:17,396
It wasn't.

1139
00:55:17,398 --> 00:55:19,943
Monica was the one who
attacked me, didn't she?

1140
00:55:19,945 --> 00:55:21,153
Didn't she?

1141
00:55:21,155 --> 00:55:22,578
Can you blame her?

1142
00:55:23,715 --> 00:55:26,060
Sweetheart, we had a simple deal!

1143
00:55:26,062 --> 00:55:27,523
We had a simple deal!

1144
00:55:27,525 --> 00:55:31,389
And she had to go and screwed it all up.

1145
00:55:31,391 --> 00:55:33,170
(laughs)

1146
00:55:33,172 --> 00:55:36,746
I mean, fuck me, it wasn't my fault!

1147
00:55:36,748 --> 00:55:37,579
Okay?

1148
00:55:37,581 --> 00:55:39,283
It wasn't my fault.

1149
00:55:39,285 --> 00:55:40,647
You're delusional.
Oh, God.

1150
00:55:40,649 --> 00:55:41,982
And you're a monster!

1151
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:43,498
(he growls)

1152
00:55:45,005 --> 00:55:47,468
Okay, put the guilt trip
on me, I'm the bad guy,

1153
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:50,112
I'm the bad guy, I'm the bad guy!

1154
00:55:51,275 --> 00:55:52,623
Why am I the bad guy?

1155
00:55:52,625 --> 00:55:55,293
Because I'm seizing the
opportunity to step up

1156
00:55:55,295 --> 00:55:59,010
to the next level here
and become who I truly am?

1157
00:55:59,012 --> 00:56:01,020
Who I truly am!

1158
00:56:02,215 --> 00:56:03,443
Who are you truly?

1159
00:56:03,445 --> 00:56:05,423
Something more than
I am fucking right now,

1160
00:56:05,425 --> 00:56:06,893
that's for sure.

1161
00:56:06,895 --> 00:56:09,313
I can tell you that, I can tell you that.

1162
00:56:09,315 --> 00:56:11,706
I can clearly feel it in my heart!

1163
00:56:13,417 --> 00:56:15,278
Just pounding.

1164
00:56:16,845 --> 00:56:18,978
And you know, and as you know...

1165
00:56:20,125 --> 00:56:21,583
"The heart wants what it wants."

1166
00:56:21,585 --> 00:56:23,618
Emily Dickinson wrote that.

1167
00:56:24,335 --> 00:56:26,473
Fuck, she was wrong.

1168
00:56:26,475 --> 00:56:28,043
And she was a recluse.

1169
00:56:28,045 --> 00:56:30,074
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1170
00:56:30,076 --> 00:56:31,443
And what about Steve Jobs?

1171
00:56:31,445 --> 00:56:34,288
"Be brave enough to follow your heart!"

1172
00:56:37,275 --> 00:56:38,106
Really?

1173
00:56:38,108 --> 00:56:40,040
"And your feelings, because they know

1174
00:56:40,042 --> 00:56:41,118
what you really want."

1175
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:45,044
Well, everybody knows that
Steve Jobs was an asshole!

1176
00:56:45,046 --> 00:56:46,883
Why listen to him?

1177
00:56:46,885 --> 00:56:50,453
Because he was extremely
successful, and he did,

1178
00:56:50,455 --> 00:56:53,133
he influenced a lot of people, Jenna.

1179
00:56:53,135 --> 00:56:56,023
Hitler was extremely
successful and influenced

1180
00:56:56,025 --> 00:56:57,603
a lot of people.

1181
00:56:57,605 --> 00:56:58,436
Jesus Christ!

1182
00:56:58,438 --> 00:57:01,203
You're fucking stressing me out!

1183
00:57:01,205 --> 00:57:02,493
Jesus Christ.

1184
00:57:02,495 --> 00:57:05,073
You do this every fucking time, you know.

1185
00:57:05,075 --> 00:57:07,823
But this argument here
you're not gonna win,

1186
00:57:07,825 --> 00:57:09,833
let me tell you that.

1187
00:57:09,835 --> 00:57:11,213
Mm-mm.

1188
00:57:11,215 --> 00:57:12,498
Those days are over.

1189
00:57:14,345 --> 00:57:17,258
That's, that's for damn fucking sure!

1190
00:57:18,355 --> 00:57:19,548
That's for damn sure!

1191
00:57:22,249 --> 00:57:23,082
For sure.

1192
00:57:27,809 --> 00:57:29,534
(whistles)

1193
00:57:29,867 --> 00:57:31,092
Anybody home?

1194
00:57:34,714 --> 00:57:35,547
For sure.

1195
00:57:37,605 --> 00:57:39,513
(dramatic music)

1196
00:57:40,355 --> 00:57:41,446
(typing)

1197
00:57:43,588 --> 00:57:44,421
(popping)

1198
00:57:46,038 --> 00:57:47,296
(typing)

1199
00:57:48,028 --> 00:57:49,368
I feel great!

1200
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:50,203
(popping)

1201
00:57:55,904 --> 00:57:58,779
(Jenna laughs)

1202
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:01,920
Yeah.

1203
00:58:04,003 --> 00:58:07,503
(typing)

1204
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:12,155
That's how I feel.

1205
00:58:12,538 --> 00:58:13,371
(popping)

1206
00:58:20,941 --> 00:58:21,772
Phew!

1207
00:58:21,774 --> 00:58:22,799
Wow, Jenna...

1208
00:58:26,562 --> 00:58:28,393
Phew!

1209
00:58:28,395 --> 00:58:30,143
Keep your seatbelt on.

1210
00:58:30,145 --> 00:58:31,643
This is a rough fucking ride...

1211
00:58:31,645 --> 00:58:32,648
Fuck you!

1212
00:58:33,577 --> 00:58:35,219
When I first met you.

1213
00:58:36,075 --> 00:58:36,906
Huh?

1214
00:58:36,908 --> 00:58:38,550
When I first met you...

1215
00:58:39,145 --> 00:58:41,218
I was so crazy in love with you.

1216
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,068
Fuck!

1217
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:45,963
What I love you for
now, I love you for what

1218
00:58:45,965 --> 00:58:47,023
you represent to me.

1219
00:58:47,025 --> 00:58:50,503
I love you for giving me
the opportunity to step up

1220
00:58:50,505 --> 00:58:51,885
to the next level.

1221
00:58:51,887 --> 00:58:53,295
What next level?

1222
00:58:54,386 --> 00:58:55,217
(Jason chuckles)

1223
00:58:55,219 --> 00:58:57,453
Levels of power!

1224
00:58:57,455 --> 00:59:01,753
Soon I'll be unleashed and, and, and...

1225
00:59:01,755 --> 00:59:03,353
I'll become whatever I wanna be.

1226
00:59:03,355 --> 00:59:05,705
What do you think you're
gonna do after this?

1227
00:59:07,909 --> 00:59:10,693
Do you really think that you're
gonna get away with this?

1228
00:59:10,695 --> 00:59:12,648
Yeah, I am. Here's what I'm gonna do:

1229
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:15,220
I'm gonna go back to Iraq
and I'm gonna show them

1230
00:59:15,222 --> 00:59:16,405
what I can really do!

1231
00:59:18,075 --> 00:59:20,052
Soon I'll become Captain...

1232
00:59:21,102 --> 00:59:23,377
Then Colonel, then General, and...

1233
00:59:24,152 --> 00:59:24,985
You know.

1234
00:59:25,442 --> 00:59:26,436
Are you serious?

1235
00:59:26,438 --> 00:59:28,533
Yeah, I am, I'm very fucking serious.

1236
00:59:28,535 --> 00:59:30,733
Maybe I'll even become
Secretary of Defense,

1237
00:59:30,735 --> 00:59:33,593
and maybe still even
after that, I'll become

1238
00:59:33,595 --> 00:59:36,303
fucking president of the
United States of America!

1239
00:59:36,305 --> 00:59:38,298
In what world do you live in?

1240
00:59:39,195 --> 00:59:41,123
Well, isn't this the
American dream here?

1241
00:59:41,125 --> 00:59:43,368
Isn't this what America is all about?

1242
00:59:43,370 --> 00:59:44,623
No, it's not.

1243
00:59:44,625 --> 00:59:48,233
You told me yourself that it
was about the American Trinity.

1244
00:59:48,235 --> 00:59:49,273
Don't you remember?

1245
00:59:49,275 --> 00:59:50,393
I sure do.

1246
00:59:50,395 --> 00:59:55,098
E Pluribus Unum, Liberty,
Liberty, Liberty and uh...

1247
00:59:57,185 --> 00:59:58,533
Liberty and...

1248
00:59:58,535 --> 00:59:59,883
You don't remember?

1249
00:59:59,885 --> 01:00:01,352
Yeah, I do, uh...

1250
01:00:02,085 --> 01:00:03,758
How could you forget?

1251
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,285
(Jason laughs)

1252
01:00:06,315 --> 01:00:08,033
It's all over our currency.

1253
01:00:08,035 --> 01:00:08,868
It is?

1254
01:00:09,375 --> 01:00:10,956
Oh, fuck, you know what?

1255
01:00:10,958 --> 01:00:12,184
I'm sure you're right.

1256
01:00:12,186 --> 01:00:15,065
You're right, when you're
right, you're right.

1257
01:00:18,315 --> 01:00:19,148
There it is.

1258
01:00:20,182 --> 01:00:21,328
Right there.

1259
01:00:23,528 --> 01:00:25,536
And that's exactly what I'm doing.

1260
01:00:27,019 --> 01:00:29,402
(dramatic music)

1261
01:00:30,547 --> 01:00:32,723
You know, I still love you.

1262
01:00:33,215 --> 01:00:34,048
But...

1263
01:00:35,185 --> 01:00:38,048
I mean, fuck me, man, look at this mess!

1264
01:00:39,395 --> 01:00:40,846
After everything that happened here,

1265
01:00:40,848 --> 01:00:42,395
I don't know if we can go on.

1266
01:00:42,397 --> 01:00:43,940
You're fucking delusional!

1267
01:00:43,942 --> 01:00:45,847
(intense music)

1268
01:00:45,849 --> 01:00:48,082
(groaning)

1269
01:00:48,541 --> 01:00:50,433
(Jason growls)

1270
01:00:51,716 --> 01:00:54,974
(music intensifies)

1271
01:00:58,395 --> 01:01:00,319
That's it, that's it, that's it...

1272
01:01:00,321 --> 01:01:01,202
That's it...

1273
01:01:01,204 --> 01:01:02,584
(Jason shushes)

1274
01:01:02,586 --> 01:01:03,419
That's it.

1275
01:01:11,176 --> 01:01:12,009
Phew!

1276
01:01:13,653 --> 01:01:16,494
(voice whispers in Arabic)

1277
01:01:22,036 --> 01:01:25,394
(voice whispers in Arabic)

1278
01:01:30,619 --> 01:01:31,452

1279
01:01:36,523 --> 01:01:38,948

(types)

1286
01:02:01,394 --> 01:02:02,227
What?

1287
01:02:03,277 --> 01:02:04,110
(popping)

1288
01:02:14,868 --> 01:02:16,001

(dramatic music)

1297
01:03:41,815 --> 01:03:42,648
Fuck!

1298
01:03:44,285 --> 01:03:45,635
Fuck me!

1299
01:03:49,916 --> 01:03:52,882
(unsettling music)

1300
01:04:08,416 --> 01:04:10,365
(unsettling music)

1301
01:05:04,873 --> 01:05:06,729
(music builds)

1302
01:05:06,731 --> 01:05:08,394
What are you doing?

1303
01:05:08,396 --> 01:05:09,565
Nothing.

1304
01:05:09,567 --> 01:05:11,917
I'm just chatting online
with a friend of mine.

1305
01:05:13,331 --> 01:05:15,289
Hm, you're funny.

1306
01:05:22,601 --> 01:05:23,434
Emily?

1307
01:05:24,758 --> 01:05:25,708
(door knocks)

1308
01:05:26,841 --> 01:05:29,114

(clattering)

1314
01:06:09,894 --> 01:06:11,035
It's good.

01:06:30,894 --> 01:06:32,119
(clinking)

1316
01:06:39,605 --> 01:06:42,230

(thud!)

1318
01:06:51,946 --> 01:06:54,263
Ah, fucking motherfucker!

1319
01:06:54,885 --> 01:06:56,223
Fuck!

1320
01:06:56,225 --> 01:06:58,183
God damn it!

1321
01:06:58,185 --> 01:06:59,251
Motherfucker!

1322
01:07:00,210 --> 01:07:01,768

(clears throat)

1326
01:07:21,895 --> 01:07:23,503
Oh, hi, Kelly, what's up?

1327
01:07:23,505 --> 01:07:25,155
[Kelly] Hi, Jason, how are you?

1328
01:07:26,915 --> 01:07:28,964
I'm good, I'm good.

1329
01:07:28,966 --> 01:07:30,523
How are you?

1330
01:07:30,525 --> 01:07:31,370
[Kelly] Good.

1331
01:07:31,372 --> 01:07:32,795
I heard you're back in town.

1332
01:07:32,797 --> 01:07:35,228
I thought we might get
together to have lunch or so?

1333
01:07:35,230 --> 01:07:36,236
Yeah, yeah.

1334
01:07:36,238 --> 01:07:37,503
Hey, can I ask you something?

1335
01:07:37,505 --> 01:07:38,522
[Kelly] Sure.

1336
01:07:38,524 --> 01:07:41,243
Seeing as though you're
the preacher's daughter

1337
01:07:41,245 --> 01:07:42,218
and all, you know.

1338
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:43,087
(Kelly chuckles)

1339
01:07:43,089 --> 01:07:45,193
[Kelly] Yeah, but don't call me that.

1340
01:07:45,195 --> 01:07:46,353
Yeah.

1341
01:07:46,355 --> 01:07:47,768
Okay, so here it goes:

1342
01:07:49,324 --> 01:07:53,143
Who, uh... Who knows everything about me?

1343
01:07:53,145 --> 01:07:53,995
[Kelly] Google.

1344
01:07:55,225 --> 01:07:56,056
[Jason] What?

1345
01:07:56,058 --> 01:07:56,889
(Kelly laughs)

1346
01:07:56,891 --> 01:07:58,143
[Kelly] I'm kidding.

1347
01:07:58,145 --> 01:08:00,448
Only God knows everything about you.

1348
01:08:01,285 --> 01:08:02,768
And yourself, of course.

1349
01:08:03,935 --> 01:08:05,803
Does God know my thoughts?

1350
01:08:05,805 --> 01:08:06,638
[Kelly] Yes.

1351
01:08:07,758 --> 01:08:09,222
[Jason] And what about the Devil?

1352
01:08:09,224 --> 01:08:10,783
Does he know my thoughts too?

1353
01:08:11,595 --> 01:08:15,463
[Kelly] No, as far as I
know, the scripture doesn't

1354
01:08:15,465 --> 01:08:18,468
say Satan or his demons can
read your mind or thoughts.

1355
01:08:19,505 --> 01:08:21,088
Why do you ask?

1356
01:08:22,895 --> 01:08:25,053
I was just curious, that's all.

1357
01:08:25,055 --> 01:08:26,413
What else do you know?

1358
01:08:26,415 --> 01:08:28,803
[Kelly] Satan can't
read your mind, but he

1359
01:08:28,805 --> 01:08:32,013
can ascertain the general
flow of your thoughts

1360
01:08:32,015 --> 01:08:35,444
by the words you speak
and the actions you take.

1361
01:08:35,446 --> 01:08:38,213
He can make a well-educated
guess as to what you're

1362
01:08:38,215 --> 01:08:41,705
thinking, and then attempts
to use it to his advantage.

1363
01:08:43,571 --> 01:08:45,305
Were you tempted?

1364
01:08:45,313 --> 01:08:47,735
[Jason] No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1365
01:08:47,737 --> 01:08:48,960
nothing like that.

1366
01:08:48,962 --> 01:08:49,795
I was...

1367
01:08:50,970 --> 01:08:52,778
I was just curious, that's all.

1368
01:08:53,628 --> 01:08:55,838
Do you speak Arabic by chance?

1369
01:08:56,748 --> 01:08:59,715
[Kelly] No, I only studied
some Latin, but not much.

1370
01:09:01,555 --> 01:09:06,263
[Jason] So you don't know
what (speaks in Arabic) means?

1371
01:09:07,913 --> 01:09:09,098
(Kelly laughs)

1372
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:11,361
[Kelly] No, I've no idea.

1373
01:09:11,363 --> 01:09:12,738
Who said that to you?

1374
01:09:13,386 --> 01:09:16,610
Oh, it was just some dude
over in Iraq, that's all.

1375
01:09:16,612 --> 01:09:17,919
It's no big deal.

1376
01:09:17,921 --> 01:09:19,853
[Kelly] Look it up on the Internet.

1377
01:09:19,855 --> 01:09:21,003
[Jason] Yeah, you know what...

1378
01:09:21,005 --> 01:09:23,043
Yeah, yeah, I think I'll do that.

1379
01:09:23,045 --> 01:09:25,219
Say, can I call you back
in a couple of days?

1380
01:09:25,221 --> 01:09:28,459
And we'll (stammers) we'll grab lunch?

1381
01:09:28,461 --> 01:09:30,063
[Kelly] Cool, see you then!

1382
01:09:30,065 --> 01:09:32,106
[Jason] Okay, cool, you take care.

1383
01:09:34,132 --> 01:09:39,057
(clicking)

1384
01:09:43,805 --> 01:09:46,014

Hey, Jason.

1393
01:12:19,426 --> 01:12:20,952
Where you going, Jason?

1394
01:12:22,655 --> 01:12:24,243
I'm sorry, who are you?

1395
01:12:24,245 --> 01:12:25,616
I'm Pastor Warren.

1396
01:12:26,885 --> 01:12:28,258
Pastor Warren?

1397
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:32,043
I'm sorry, how's it that you know my name?

1398
01:12:32,045 --> 01:12:36,148
I'm not sure, I just somehow know it.

1399
01:12:38,275 --> 01:12:43,275
Oh, I see, you must be Kelly's
dad, the preacher, right?

1400
01:12:43,785 --> 01:12:44,685
Where you going?

1401
01:12:45,785 --> 01:12:48,333
Oh, I was going camping.

1402
01:12:48,335 --> 01:12:49,893
I see.

1403
01:12:49,895 --> 01:12:51,226
What's in the suitcase?

1404
01:12:51,228 --> 01:12:52,059
(Jason chuckles)

1405
01:12:52,061 --> 01:12:53,688
Well, camping stuff, what else?

1406
01:12:55,405 --> 01:12:58,743
Where's Eric, Monica, and Emily?

1407
01:12:58,745 --> 01:13:01,316
Oh, yeah, they already took
off in the camper a while ago.

1408
01:13:01,318 --> 01:13:03,273
I had to come back to get some extra

1409
01:13:03,275 --> 01:13:05,533
camping gear that we forgot.

1410
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:06,368
What gear?

1411
01:13:07,293 --> 01:13:08,249
(Jason laughs)

1412
01:13:08,251 --> 01:13:10,771
Dude, what's with
all the questions, man?

1413
01:13:11,623 --> 01:13:13,415
I know what's in the suitcases.

1414
01:13:14,315 --> 01:13:16,743
And I know you're not going camping.

1415
01:13:16,745 --> 01:13:17,913
Is that right?

1416
01:13:17,915 --> 01:13:19,893
I even know where you're really going.

1417
01:13:19,895 --> 01:13:21,845
So where is it that I'm really going?

1418
01:13:22,865 --> 01:13:27,865
You're going to prison, Jason,
for a very, very long time.

1419
01:13:28,420 --> 01:13:29,743
What?

1420
01:13:29,745 --> 01:13:31,733
Solitary confinement actually.

1421
01:13:31,735 --> 01:13:33,243
[Jason] What?

1422
01:13:33,245 --> 01:13:35,383
Death row, to be exact.

1423
01:13:35,385 --> 01:13:38,242
Man, what the fuck
are you talking about?

1424
01:13:38,244 --> 01:13:40,410
Do you honestly think
you can get away with all

1425
01:13:40,412 --> 01:13:41,823
that you've done?

1426
01:13:41,825 --> 01:13:43,173
Okay, look...

1427
01:13:43,175 --> 01:13:44,543
I'm really busy right now.

1428
01:13:44,545 --> 01:13:45,376
I got shit to do.

1429
01:13:45,378 --> 01:13:46,933
I'm already actually running late, so...

1430
01:13:46,935 --> 01:13:50,878
For God's sake, stop denying
what both of us already know.

1431
01:13:52,125 --> 01:13:54,553
To whom did you talk with yesterday?

1432
01:13:54,555 --> 01:13:56,103
Who did I talk to yesterday?

1433
01:13:56,105 --> 01:13:58,913
None of your fucking business
is who I talked to yesterday!

1434
01:13:58,915 --> 01:14:02,148
Jason, everything has already happened.

1435
01:14:03,415 --> 01:14:07,463
I just wanna help you to
finally see the truth.

1436
01:14:07,465 --> 01:14:08,923
The real truth.

1437
01:14:08,925 --> 01:14:12,048
Come on, at least tell me who
you talked with yesterday.

1438
01:14:12,596 --> 01:14:13,618
(chuckles)

1439
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:14,826
You know what?

1440
01:14:14,828 --> 01:14:16,658
I'm gonna tell you who
I talked to yesterday.

1441
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:18,606
I talked to a very
evolved being yesterday,

1442
01:14:18,608 --> 01:14:20,553
someone who knew everything about me.

1443
01:14:20,555 --> 01:14:21,386
Okay?

1444
01:14:21,388 --> 01:14:23,723
Someone who showed me the path to God.

1445
01:14:23,725 --> 01:14:25,233
That's who I talked to.

1446
01:14:25,235 --> 01:14:26,453
The path to God?

1447
01:14:26,455 --> 01:14:27,605
[Jason] That's right.

1448
01:14:28,585 --> 01:14:31,703
Did that someone tell
you, by any chance,

1449
01:14:31,705 --> 01:14:35,118
that you could be like God, or Godlike?

1450
01:14:36,205 --> 01:14:38,143
Please, don't tell me
you fell for the oldest

1451
01:14:38,145 --> 01:14:39,228
lie in the book.

1452
01:14:40,065 --> 01:14:40,896
What?

1453
01:14:40,898 --> 01:14:41,731
What lie?

1454
01:14:43,485 --> 01:14:45,048
Satan's first lie.

1455
01:14:46,045 --> 01:14:49,719
Ah, here it is: "Eat of this fruit...

1456
01:14:49,721 --> 01:14:54,359
"And your eyes will be opened,
and you will be like God."

1457
01:14:54,361 --> 01:14:56,223
(chuckles)

1458
01:14:56,225 --> 01:14:58,758
Well, you know, I just
listened to my heart.

1459
01:15:00,005 --> 01:15:01,103
Yeah.

1460
01:15:01,105 --> 01:15:02,528
You think your heart is connected

1461
01:15:02,530 --> 01:15:04,055
to something bigger than you?

1462
01:15:04,825 --> 01:15:09,168
Something you may call
spirit, the unconscious,

1463
01:15:10,105 --> 01:15:15,105
your higher-self, the
universe, or even God?

1464
01:15:15,725 --> 01:15:19,173
Yeah, you know, what's wrong with that?

1465
01:15:19,175 --> 01:15:20,743
How could that be wrong?

1466
01:15:20,745 --> 01:15:22,778
Yeah, how could that ever be wrong?

1467
01:15:24,625 --> 01:15:27,503
I can see you were
never exactly a diligent

1468
01:15:27,505 --> 01:15:29,583
student of the word, were you?

1469
01:15:29,585 --> 01:15:32,273
Hey, man, in God we trust, right?

1470
01:15:32,275 --> 01:15:33,138
Exactly.

1471
01:15:35,275 --> 01:15:37,093
So here is what God says.

1472
01:15:37,095 --> 01:15:42,050
Jeremiah 17:9: "The
human heart is the most

1473
01:15:42,052 --> 01:15:46,203
deceitful of all things,
and desperately wicked."

1474
01:15:46,205 --> 01:15:47,788
Hold on. Let me see this.

1475
01:15:47,790 --> 01:15:49,248
Does it really say that?

1476
01:15:50,975 --> 01:15:52,058
It's over, Jason.

1477
01:15:56,333 --> 01:15:57,916
(dramatic music)

1478
01:15:58,807 --> 01:16:01,833
Let me tell you something,
man, nobody can stop me.

1479
01:16:01,835 --> 01:16:04,363
I'm in control, motherfucker, you hear me?

1480
01:16:04,365 --> 01:16:06,093
I'm in charge!

1481
01:16:06,095 --> 01:16:06,928
No.

1482
01:16:08,326 --> 01:16:10,051
(gunshot fires)

1483
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:15,847
(dramatic music)

1484
01:16:15,849 --> 01:16:16,905
What the fuck?!

1485
01:16:16,907 --> 01:16:19,533
Jason, you're so hopelessly
delusional you can't

1486
01:16:19,535 --> 01:16:21,642
even see what's in front of you.

1487
01:16:23,985 --> 01:16:25,208
I can see you, man.

1488
01:16:26,445 --> 01:16:27,923
Try to see beyond me.

1489
01:16:31,345 --> 01:16:34,810
Don't you see the police
car, all the cops...

1490
01:16:34,812 --> 01:16:35,726
(cocking guns)

1491
01:16:35,728 --> 01:16:37,711
And all the weapons
that are pointed at you?

1492
01:16:42,929 --> 01:16:43,812
There's no escape.

1493
01:16:46,526 --> 01:16:47,501
It's over.

1494
01:16:48,295 --> 01:16:51,794
There's a small prison
cell waiting for you.

1495
01:16:51,796 --> 01:16:55,293
And in about 10 years, the electric chair.

1496
01:16:57,015 --> 01:16:57,905
No, no, no.

1497
01:16:58,772 --> 01:17:00,214
No, this can't happen.

1498
01:17:00,708 --> 01:17:02,360
Just give up.

1499
01:17:02,362 --> 01:17:03,695
I'll be there for you.

1500
01:17:04,805 --> 01:17:06,619
Nobody can stop me, man.

1501
01:17:06,621 --> 01:17:08,169
(music builds)

1502
01:17:08,171 --> 01:17:09,004
[Pastor] No!

1503
01:17:09,012 --> 01:17:10,628
(gunshot fires)

1504
01:17:15,278 --> 01:17:17,811
