<i>It has
now been several years</i>

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,786
<i>since the attack
by the creatures</i>

4
00:00:05,788 --> 00:00:07,720
<i>that rose from
the depths of the ocean</i>

5
00:00:07,722 --> 00:00:10,658
<i>and threatened to destroy
all life on earth.</i>

6
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,658
<i>The death toll
was high that day,</i>

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,694
<i>particularly on the East Coast
of the United States.</i>

8
00:00:15,696 --> 00:00:19,031
<i>But, thankfully, a team
of specially trained pilots</i>

9
00:00:19,033 --> 00:00:21,568
<i>commandeered the Armada
Military Robot Series</i>

10
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,336
<i>and went to the battle
with the beasts.</i>

11
00:00:23,338 --> 00:00:26,839
<i>Those brave soldiers and
their massive, high-tech armors</i>

12
00:00:26,841 --> 00:00:29,443
<i>saved the planet
from certain destruction.</i>

13
00:00:29,445 --> 00:00:31,345
<i>Despite the success
of the Armadas,</i>

14
00:00:31,347 --> 00:00:33,046
<i>the destruction is widespread,</i>

15
00:00:33,048 --> 00:00:36,683
<i>and rebuilding the areas
hit the hardest has been slow.</i>

16
00:00:36,685 --> 00:00:39,220
<i>Preventing another such
catastrophe is the topic</i>

17
00:00:39,222 --> 00:00:41,988
<i>of much heated debate
amongst the military,</i>

18
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,791
<i>the State Department, and other
national security forces.</i>

19
00:00:45,793 --> 00:00:48,928
<i>But rest assured, patrols
from the sea, on the land,</i>

20
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,165
<i>and in the air remain
steadfast on preventing</i>

21
00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:53,900
<i>such a horrible event
from occurring again.</i>

22
00:00:53,902 --> 00:00:56,235
<i>Nuclear submarines
even comb the ocean's floor</i>

23
00:00:56,237 --> 00:00:58,906
<i>as a part of the vigilant
line of defense.</i>

24
00:00:58,908 --> 00:01:00,873
<i>It's now been years
of peace and quiet,</i>

25
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:04,546
<i>and the entire world is
about to breathe again.</i>

26
00:01:08,617 --> 00:01:11,118
This is <i>Neptune's Nest.
Intrepid Gull,</i>

27
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,254
<i>do you copy?</i>

28
00:01:13,256 --> 00:01:14,821
Yeah, I'm not dead yet.

29
00:01:14,823 --> 00:01:16,490
How's Red Sector today?

30
00:01:16,492 --> 00:01:18,591
Sonar isn't showing
anything right now.

31
00:01:18,593 --> 00:01:21,193
Have you been drinking?

32
00:01:21,195 --> 00:01:24,163
I'm retired... sort of.

33
00:01:24,165 --> 00:01:26,166
Have you been running
the multiple ray sonar today?

34
00:01:26,168 --> 00:01:28,035
Yeah, a little bit.

35
00:01:28,037 --> 00:01:30,369
Hey, you're still
on the payroll.

36
00:01:30,371 --> 00:01:33,240
Yeah, I've been running it
every day this week.

37
00:01:33,242 --> 00:01:34,975
Nothing to show.

38
00:01:37,813 --> 00:01:41,718
Hold on a second.
I spoke too soon.

39
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:57,797
I, uh, I got something here.
You seeing this?

40
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:59,933
Affirmative,
<i>Intrepid Gull.</i>

41
00:01:59,935 --> 00:02:02,068
<i>You are to take preemptive
measures immediately.</i>

42
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,737
All right, relax.

43
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:06,042
Probably just
a minor tec drift.

44
00:02:10,645 --> 00:02:12,614
Depth mines are launched.

45
00:02:16,384 --> 00:02:21,858
First contact
in five seconds, four...

46
00:02:24,058 --> 00:02:25,561
three...

47
00:02:26,962 --> 00:02:28,063
two...

48
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:34,268
one.

49
00:02:37,606 --> 00:02:39,538
Contact one,

50
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,741
<i>contact two,
three and four.</i>

51
00:02:42,743 --> 00:02:44,411
All charges
have made contact.

52
00:02:44,413 --> 00:02:46,311
Now I'm not showing anything.

53
00:02:46,313 --> 00:02:48,815
Copy, <i>Intrepid Gull.</i>

54
00:02:48,817 --> 00:02:50,584
<i>We're deploying submersibles
to investigate.</i>

55
00:02:50,586 --> 00:02:52,151
What the hell?

56
00:02:52,153 --> 00:02:53,855
They're back!
It's not possible!

57
00:02:58,593 --> 00:03:00,459
Intrepid Gull,
<i>you're to move two clicks</i>

58
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:01,862
<i>southwest immediately!</i>

59
00:03:01,864 --> 00:03:05,065
I say again,
regroup with the flotilla!

60
00:03:05,067 --> 00:03:06,169
Copy that.

61
00:03:11,706 --> 00:03:13,909
No.
No, no, no.

62
00:03:19,348 --> 00:03:22,452
Holy shit!
What the hell?

63
00:03:26,421 --> 00:03:28,457
Open fire!

64
00:03:32,093 --> 00:03:34,294
What the hell?
Come on, come on!

65
00:04:12,334 --> 00:04:14,103
Main guns, fire!

66
00:04:31,786 --> 00:04:34,355
Hey, bro, if you need
help with the kids,

67
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,257
<i>you and Jenny gotta do it
on your own.</i>

68
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:37,690
- They're back!
- What?

69
00:04:37,692 --> 00:04:39,159
They're back, man!

70
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:40,661
You sure?

71
00:04:40,663 --> 00:04:42,394
They took down a battleship!

72
00:04:42,396 --> 00:04:44,098
<i>It was heading towards shore.</i>

73
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,933
<i>It's probably there by now.</i>

74
00:04:45,935 --> 00:04:48,500
I swear, man.
We found another one!

75
00:04:48,502 --> 00:04:51,337
<i>Someone should be rolling up
on you in a minute.</i>

76
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:53,038
It's a guy named Russo.

77
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,608
<i>I told everyone we were gonna
see these things again.</i>

78
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,377
And I said to we need to update
the Armadas from day one!

79
00:04:57,379 --> 00:04:59,115
Well, now's your chance.

80
00:05:03,552 --> 00:05:05,019
Well, here's your boy.

81
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:07,657
All right.
I'll hit you later.

82
00:05:16,598 --> 00:05:18,298
Got him.

83
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,233
Dr. Roth?

84
00:05:20,235 --> 00:05:22,269
My name is Russo,
head of the Tactical

85
00:05:22,271 --> 00:05:25,238
and Security Division
of Hallstrom's Labs.

86
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,574
We're here to escort you
safely to the facility.

87
00:05:27,576 --> 00:05:29,612
Yeah, I know.

88
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:33,480
Do you mind if
I go grab a change?

89
00:05:33,482 --> 00:05:35,348
We stopped by your house.
We have your things.

90
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,250
They're in the car.
Let's go.

91
00:05:38,788 --> 00:05:41,691
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
We're burning daylight!

92
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:04,010
- ...in some small way.
- Whenever you're ready.

93
00:06:04,012 --> 00:06:05,878
Oh!

94
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,014
Excuse you! What do you think
you're looking at?

95
00:06:09,016 --> 00:06:10,949
I was just being polite.

96
00:06:10,951 --> 00:06:13,452
Well, that girl's crushing
on you hard, so careful.

97
00:06:13,454 --> 00:06:15,187
She's right. She didn't
charge you for your drinks.

98
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:16,322
What?

99
00:06:16,324 --> 00:06:17,856
I'm sure
that's not the case.

100
00:06:17,858 --> 00:06:19,459
She's new.
Maybe she made a mistake.

101
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:21,631
Right.
I'm sure that's what it was.

102
00:06:22,964 --> 00:06:25,300
- This is on me.
- You're damn right it is.

103
00:06:30,338 --> 00:06:32,938
Have you guys heard anything
about what's going down?

104
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,375
All the higher-ups
were a little tense today.

105
00:06:35,377 --> 00:06:37,644
I think I even saw
Worthington on the premises.

106
00:06:37,646 --> 00:06:39,346
I don't know,
but I heard someone

107
00:06:39,348 --> 00:06:41,848
say they wanna bring in
that Dr. Roth guy

108
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,349
that got fired a while ago.

109
00:06:43,351 --> 00:06:45,284
Dr. Roth? Yeah,
that guy's super messed up.

110
00:06:45,286 --> 00:06:47,387
That's why he got fired
in the first place.

111
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:51,591
If you ask me, I think they
made a mistake letting him go.

112
00:06:51,593 --> 00:06:53,459
He designed the original OS.

113
00:06:53,461 --> 00:06:55,495
He's the only one
who truly knew the Bots.

114
00:06:55,497 --> 00:06:58,130
All I know is Horowitz
was pissed they were thinking

115
00:06:58,132 --> 00:06:59,867
about bringing
in someone else.

116
00:06:59,869 --> 00:07:01,233
Horowitz?

117
00:07:01,235 --> 00:07:03,670
She's super messed up too.
Should be fun.

118
00:07:03,672 --> 00:07:05,671
Tense times.

119
00:07:05,673 --> 00:07:08,140
Hmmm.

120
00:07:08,142 --> 00:07:11,577
That was a risky move.
You should be more careful.

121
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:13,081
And who's winning?

122
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:16,882
Oh!
He's got no skills!

123
00:07:16,884 --> 00:07:19,019
I must have some skills.

124
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:21,253
Otherwise, I wouldn't
be your squad leader.

125
00:07:21,255 --> 00:07:24,223
Between us, I think
it's good that

126
00:07:24,225 --> 00:07:26,058
they're bringing in
some extra help.

127
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,795
We don't know what's coming,

128
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:29,295
and if it's anything
like last time,

129
00:07:29,297 --> 00:07:30,930
it's not gonna be
a walk in a park.

130
00:07:30,932 --> 00:07:32,899
They kicked those
things' asses last time.

131
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:34,233
I say bring it on.

132
00:07:34,235 --> 00:07:36,435
I'm itching
for some action too.

133
00:07:36,437 --> 00:07:38,538
But what do we really know
about these things?

134
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,507
We know they're big giant,
ugly-ass motherfuckers,

135
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:44,010
and they kill people.
What else is there to know?

136
00:07:44,012 --> 00:07:45,978
There is this guy at training
that said he actually

137
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,615
saw one of these things
with his own eyes.

138
00:07:48,617 --> 00:07:50,115
Said it was spitting fire.

139
00:07:50,117 --> 00:07:51,718
What? Like a dragon?

140
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,353
Wait. Don't believe everything
you hear, Badger.

141
00:07:54,355 --> 00:07:56,690
Either way,
these things are strong.

142
00:07:56,692 --> 00:07:59,493
Probably even stronger than us.

143
00:07:59,495 --> 00:08:01,995
I mean, I can't be the only
one who's worried

144
00:08:01,997 --> 00:08:05,664
about these new Bots,
new OS, new everything.

145
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,433
And the feedback pain?

146
00:08:08,435 --> 00:08:10,402
If the real deal's anything
like what they put us through

147
00:08:10,404 --> 00:08:14,207
in simulation,
then we are screwed.

148
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:17,010
Oh, babe, afraid of pain?

149
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:19,545
No. I'm concerned
about performance.

150
00:08:19,547 --> 00:08:22,216
Yeah! Hammer
has performance anxiety.

151
00:08:22,218 --> 00:08:23,784
Seriously.

152
00:08:23,786 --> 00:08:26,185
I'm willing to do whatever it
takes to defend this country,

153
00:08:26,187 --> 00:08:28,187
but I can't be the
only one who feels like

154
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:29,992
we're just not ready.

155
00:08:31,392 --> 00:08:33,160
You scared?

156
00:08:33,162 --> 00:08:36,463
Yes.
You should be, too.

157
00:08:36,465 --> 00:08:38,265
And we never even got
to field test these things.

158
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:41,434
Guys, we've been
in the sim so much.

159
00:08:41,436 --> 00:08:43,201
If we're not ready now,
we're never gonna be.

160
00:08:43,203 --> 00:08:45,537
You don't die in the sim.

161
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:47,105
Are you afraid to die?

162
00:08:47,107 --> 00:08:49,275
You can't be
if you wanna survive.

163
00:08:49,277 --> 00:08:52,548
I'm ready to die. Are you?

164
00:08:54,082 --> 00:08:55,581
Since the day I was born.

165
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,650
Ooh-rah!

166
00:09:02,423 --> 00:09:04,623
You know we really shouldn't
be talking about this

167
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:05,892
in a public place.

168
00:09:05,894 --> 00:09:07,459
She's right.

169
00:09:07,461 --> 00:09:09,195
Most of the time.

170
00:09:09,197 --> 00:09:11,330
Quit it with
that charming shit.

171
00:09:11,332 --> 00:09:12,866
What has that
ever gotten you?

172
00:09:12,868 --> 00:09:14,767
Free drinks.

173
00:09:16,304 --> 00:09:17,704
You guys think we have
time to hit the beach

174
00:09:17,706 --> 00:09:19,104
before we have to go back in?

175
00:09:19,106 --> 00:09:21,206
Oh, I'm so sick of
playing third wheel

176
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,541
with you two wheelbarrows.

177
00:09:22,543 --> 00:09:24,944
- What does that even mean?
- Figure it out.

178
00:09:24,946 --> 00:09:28,047
We're awesome.

179
00:09:29,717 --> 00:09:32,352
What was that?

180
00:09:32,354 --> 00:09:35,391
- They're playing our song.
- Let's go.

181
00:09:42,129 --> 00:09:43,762
So, catch me up.

182
00:09:43,764 --> 00:09:45,531
The creature made land.

183
00:09:45,533 --> 00:09:47,166
We're not sure
what it's doing.

184
00:09:47,168 --> 00:09:48,935
It settled down
along the shore

185
00:09:48,937 --> 00:09:50,435
and hasn't moved since.

186
00:09:50,437 --> 00:09:54,073
This is gonna be as bad
as it was the first time.

187
00:09:54,075 --> 00:09:56,045
Probably worse.

188
00:09:58,913 --> 00:10:02,382
Giant Killer, this is Russo.
We're on approach.

189
00:10:02,384 --> 00:10:03,449
Giant Killer?

190
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:05,084
Are you comfortable
back there?

191
00:10:05,086 --> 00:10:07,186
No, not really.

192
00:10:07,188 --> 00:10:08,623
Good.

193
00:10:37,418 --> 00:10:39,487
What the hell
is this place?

194
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,761
Long ride, huh?

195
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,661
<i>Personnel on standby.</i>

196
00:11:22,663 --> 00:11:25,464
The facility is
30 stories beneath ground.

197
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,050
- Hey, Maggie?
- Yeah?

198
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:47,054
You seeing
what I'm seeing?

199
00:11:47,056 --> 00:11:50,123
Yeah, and it
doesn't look good.

200
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,061
What the...

201
00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:57,028
Come on, Karen, pick up!

202
00:12:01,201 --> 00:12:04,237
Alex, uh... I... I was
just about to call you.

203
00:12:04,239 --> 00:12:07,607
Listen, get Sam
and get out now!

204
00:12:07,609 --> 00:12:09,142
<i>I'll meet you
at a rendezvous.</i>

205
00:12:09,144 --> 00:12:10,743
I'm seeing something
really weird.

206
00:12:10,745 --> 00:12:12,512
They're back.

207
00:12:12,514 --> 00:12:14,280
What do you mean,
they're back?

208
00:12:14,282 --> 00:12:16,815
Karen, where's Sam?

209
00:12:16,817 --> 00:12:18,184
She has my car.

210
00:12:18,186 --> 00:12:19,685
She's gonna
pick me up for lunch.

211
00:12:19,687 --> 00:12:21,655
Okay. I'll meet you
at the rendezvous.

212
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,421
<i>Let me know if you
can't get her.</i>

213
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:26,191
I gotta go now.
I love you.

214
00:12:26,193 --> 00:12:27,628
Wait...

215
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,174
<i>Sam, call me
as soon as you get this.</i>

216
00:12:41,176 --> 00:12:42,478
<i>It's am emergency!</i>

217
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,153
Try to keep up, Mr. Roth.

218
00:12:54,155 --> 00:12:56,090
Yes, sir.

219
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,596
Dr. Roth?

220
00:13:01,663 --> 00:13:03,161
Thanks for coming out
so quickly.

221
00:13:03,163 --> 00:13:05,498
- Did I have a choice?
- No.

222
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,834
I'm General Worthington.
The Pentagon sent me.

223
00:13:07,836 --> 00:13:09,535
The Pentagon?

224
00:13:09,537 --> 00:13:12,704
This is more of a private
facility. Where's Chuck?

225
00:13:12,706 --> 00:13:15,342
This falls under
the Department of Defense.

226
00:13:15,344 --> 00:13:17,676
Mr. Rickman
will not be present.

227
00:13:17,678 --> 00:13:19,612
Okay.

228
00:13:19,614 --> 00:13:21,982
Larry Enders tells me
you've been caught up

229
00:13:21,984 --> 00:13:24,684
with everything so far.
Is that correct?

230
00:13:24,686 --> 00:13:26,618
Yeah, sort of.
So what's the deal here?

231
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,689
The new Bots aren't working
like Rickman and Mike

232
00:13:29,691 --> 00:13:31,793
and all the other geniuses
thought they would?

233
00:13:33,761 --> 00:13:35,795
What do you want from me?

234
00:13:35,797 --> 00:13:38,031
You were working
on a neural-interface

235
00:13:38,033 --> 00:13:39,733
with artificial intelligence

236
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:42,334
without the endurance
and transference of pain

237
00:13:42,336 --> 00:13:45,403
from machine to the pilot...

238
00:13:45,405 --> 00:13:48,307
the problem we had
with the last Armada series.

239
00:13:48,309 --> 00:13:49,642
I gave you guys
the solutions.

240
00:13:49,644 --> 00:13:51,176
You didn't wanna use them.

241
00:13:51,178 --> 00:13:54,414
Look, lives
are at stake here.

242
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,418
Let's cut past that.

243
00:13:59,254 --> 00:14:01,720
Okay. Spinal cord
stimulation generator.

244
00:14:01,722 --> 00:14:05,724
It reroutes the sensation
of pain from the axon nerves

245
00:14:05,726 --> 00:14:10,162
and recycles them through the
generator in an endless loop.

246
00:14:10,164 --> 00:14:14,469
So the pain message never makes
it to the brain, essentially.

247
00:14:16,538 --> 00:14:18,671
It sounds easy.
It's not.

248
00:14:18,673 --> 00:14:20,539
Let me guess.

249
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:23,810
The DOD's neural transfer link
bullshit method

250
00:14:23,812 --> 00:14:27,214
for mitigating pain
failed to prove successful,

251
00:14:27,216 --> 00:14:30,249
and now you realize
that you need to adapt

252
00:14:30,251 --> 00:14:33,419
my neural-transfer link
to the Bots' AI system?

253
00:14:33,421 --> 00:14:35,224
Is that correct, General?

254
00:14:37,392 --> 00:14:40,560
Yes, sir.
Let me show you something.

255
00:14:52,673 --> 00:14:57,142
These are the new Armada Series
Military Robots.

256
00:14:57,144 --> 00:14:58,911
They're not bad.

257
00:14:58,913 --> 00:15:01,750
We need to try your
neural-link immediately.

258
00:15:04,152 --> 00:15:05,621
Let's do it.

259
00:15:14,995 --> 00:15:17,196
I assume you already have
pilots that are trained

260
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:18,730
to fly these things, right?

261
00:15:18,732 --> 00:15:21,568
Our pilots have been
trained on simulators.

262
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,401
But those simulators
are operated by

263
00:15:23,403 --> 00:15:25,403
the old AI software
interface.

264
00:15:25,405 --> 00:15:27,839
- So never?
- Red tape.

265
00:15:27,841 --> 00:15:29,876
What else is new?

266
00:15:29,878 --> 00:15:32,811
<i>Dr. Horowitz, the buildings
are crumbling like dirt!</i>

267
00:15:32,813 --> 00:15:34,980
<i>Are you telling me
your Bots are not ready?</i>

268
00:15:34,982 --> 00:15:36,348
No. No, no, no.

269
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,517
Look, I can assure you
that the Armada program

270
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,786
is completely
under control, okay?

271
00:15:40,788 --> 00:15:43,489
I can assure you that Roth
nor anyone else is going to be

272
00:15:43,491 --> 00:15:45,557
a problem,
not even the General.

273
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:47,593
<i>Look, Horowitz,
with all due respect,</i>

274
00:15:47,595 --> 00:15:50,662
<i>someone with as little
experience as you is...</i>

275
00:15:50,664 --> 00:15:52,431
<i>let's just say it's just
a tad bit disconcerting.</i>

276
00:15:52,433 --> 00:15:55,267
I've been in this field
for many years now.

277
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:57,036
I've seen men and women die,

278
00:15:57,038 --> 00:16:00,573
and I was here the last time
these goddamn things

279
00:16:00,575 --> 00:16:03,309
killed the people that I love
right in front of me!

280
00:16:03,311 --> 00:16:04,877
Can you say the same
for yourself?

281
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:06,646
<i>Well, then
it's all on you.</i>

282
00:16:06,648 --> 00:16:08,914
<i>Mission accomplished,
you'll get a medal.</i>

283
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,983
<i>Mission failure,
blood on your hands.</i>

284
00:16:10,985 --> 00:16:12,484
<i>More blood.</i>

285
00:16:12,486 --> 00:16:14,387
<i>Mr. Roth has arrived.</i>

286
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:16,325
I'll be right there.

287
00:16:19,226 --> 00:16:21,261
Ah, Dr. Horowitz.

288
00:16:21,263 --> 00:16:23,595
Has Naval Command
reached you yet?

289
00:16:23,597 --> 00:16:28,267
No, not yet, Dr. Horowitz.
This is Dr. J.P. Roth.

290
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:31,938
He'll be assisting us for
the robotics' neural-interface.

291
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,305
Nice to meet you.

292
00:16:33,307 --> 00:16:34,806
I know who you are.

293
00:16:34,808 --> 00:16:37,609
I read your theory on quantum
interconnectivity, yeah.

294
00:16:37,611 --> 00:16:39,645
I thought it was very
well thought out.

295
00:16:39,647 --> 00:16:41,147
You know, theoretically
speaking, of course.

296
00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:43,483
But would it really work
in reality? I don't know.

297
00:16:43,485 --> 00:16:45,017
Should I take that
as a compliment?

298
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:46,518
Maybe.

299
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,321
Dr. Roth? Andrus is
on a secure line for you.

300
00:16:49,323 --> 00:16:50,658
Thank you.

301
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,258
Hello?

302
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,427
- You at the labs?
- Yeah.

303
00:16:55,429 --> 00:16:56,796
I'm gonna dial in
my interface,

304
00:16:56,798 --> 00:16:58,229
see if I can get these
Bots up and running.

305
00:16:58,231 --> 00:17:00,900
Fantastic!
Keep me posted!

306
00:17:00,902 --> 00:17:04,237
Will do.
Hey, take care of yourself.

307
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:06,642
You do the same.

308
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:11,844
All right.

309
00:17:11,846 --> 00:17:15,384
Dr. Roth?
If you will...

310
00:17:19,086 --> 00:17:20,689
There she is.

311
00:17:21,856 --> 00:17:24,423
LILAC.

312
00:17:24,425 --> 00:17:26,961
- Ready to get activated?
- Yes, sir.

313
00:17:34,435 --> 00:17:36,602
Ooh! Someone changed
the operating system?

314
00:17:36,604 --> 00:17:39,104
Yeah. We're on Robonet.

315
00:17:39,106 --> 00:17:40,672
Are you kidding?

316
00:17:40,674 --> 00:17:43,074
My interface was designed
to work with Python.

317
00:17:43,076 --> 00:17:44,980
What?

318
00:17:48,816 --> 00:17:51,883
What the...?
What was that?

319
00:17:51,885 --> 00:17:54,889
I don't know,
but it wasn't good.

320
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,813
Mom, I'm stuck in traffic.

321
00:18:20,815 --> 00:18:22,981
Sam, I-I need you
to pick me up now!

322
00:18:22,983 --> 00:18:25,817
Well, tell that to
the idiot causing the traffic.

323
00:18:25,819 --> 00:18:28,653
Okay, well, you need to
find a different route.

324
00:18:28,655 --> 00:18:30,655
Wh-what's wrong?

325
00:18:30,657 --> 00:18:32,792
You have five minutes!

326
00:18:32,794 --> 00:18:35,831
Five minutes? Mom, I'm gonna
have to break a few laws.

327
00:18:37,198 --> 00:18:40,065
Five minutes. Don't stop
for anyone or anything.

328
00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:44,335
Awesome. Wait.
This isn't some kind of trick?

329
00:18:44,337 --> 00:18:46,540
I love you. Be safe.

330
00:18:52,646 --> 00:18:54,780
Python integrates better
with brain mapping.

331
00:18:54,782 --> 00:18:56,681
I mean, it costs more,
a hell of lot more,

332
00:18:56,683 --> 00:19:00,186
but it's better
for the crossover.

333
00:19:00,188 --> 00:19:01,853
Robonet's like a dinosaur.

334
00:19:01,855 --> 00:19:04,590
Money's not an issue.
This is life or death.

335
00:19:04,592 --> 00:19:07,226
Robonet and Python RTC
do share some

336
00:19:07,228 --> 00:19:11,530
common binary interface,
but... one wrong line of code,

337
00:19:11,532 --> 00:19:12,965
this whole place
is gonna blow.

338
00:19:12,967 --> 00:19:15,470
Have the pilots
been brain-mapped?

339
00:19:16,471 --> 00:19:18,837
- They have.
- Great.

340
00:19:19,907 --> 00:19:21,474
Look, I can only write
so much code.

341
00:19:21,476 --> 00:19:23,111
Let me see those pilots.

342
00:19:38,358 --> 00:19:40,492
<i>All pilots
report to the side room.</i>

343
00:19:40,494 --> 00:19:43,063
<i>I repeat, report to the side
room as soon as possible.</i>

344
00:19:59,914 --> 00:20:01,646
Bunch of kids.

345
00:20:01,648 --> 00:20:03,516
I hope I don't fry
their brains.

346
00:20:03,518 --> 00:20:05,720
They've had training, Doc.

347
00:20:09,423 --> 00:20:12,760
What's going on, Doc?
Why aren't the Bots responding?

348
00:20:16,263 --> 00:20:17,965
That lag.

349
00:20:20,868 --> 00:20:23,902
I can't fix the lag without
overhauling the entire software.

350
00:20:23,904 --> 00:20:25,904
There's no time
for that, Doctor!

351
00:20:25,906 --> 00:20:27,640
These pilots
are highly trained.

352
00:20:27,642 --> 00:20:29,508
They'll be able to compensate.

353
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:32,178
I'm not sending these
pilots up there

354
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,080
to their death without
control of their Bots!

355
00:20:34,082 --> 00:20:35,814
Do you get it?

356
00:20:35,816 --> 00:20:38,718
My name is Hammer, sir.

357
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,821
I knew the risks when
I signed up for the job.

358
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,855
They need us out there.

359
00:20:43,857 --> 00:20:48,061
Do you understand the problem
we have here, Hammer?

360
00:20:48,063 --> 00:20:50,196
You have a lag.

361
00:20:50,198 --> 00:20:53,332
That's a delayed response
in your brain's motor impulse

362
00:20:53,334 --> 00:20:55,767
to the Bot's AI system.

363
00:20:55,769 --> 00:20:59,103
You'll never see a strike.
You see?

364
00:20:59,105 --> 00:21:03,575
If you had a lag, you never
would have seen that coming.

365
00:21:03,577 --> 00:21:06,577
I appreciate
your concern, sir.

366
00:21:06,579 --> 00:21:08,213
We all do.

367
00:21:08,215 --> 00:21:11,182
It's all we got, Doc.

368
00:21:11,184 --> 00:21:14,923
I lost my family
to those things three years ago.

369
00:21:15,824 --> 00:21:20,595
Please, let us do our jobs.

370
00:21:23,565 --> 00:21:26,301
All right, rig 'em up.

371
00:21:37,913 --> 00:21:38,878
Mom?

372
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,645
Out! I'm driving.

373
00:21:40,647 --> 00:21:42,750
What? What's going on?

374
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,257
We have to get out of town.

375
00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:54,559
What about work?
Where's Dad?

376
00:21:54,561 --> 00:21:56,862
He's gonna meet us
at grandma's house.

377
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:59,765
In Tennessee?
Out there?

378
00:21:59,767 --> 00:22:01,803
This must be bad.

379
00:22:07,407 --> 00:22:08,873
Okay, who's ready?

380
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:11,376
- Ready, sir.
- Have a seat.

381
00:22:11,378 --> 00:22:13,879
Mr. Hammer, you're gonna
feel a small shock.

382
00:22:13,881 --> 00:22:15,748
It will subside
after a moment.

383
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,216
Initializing.

384
00:22:17,218 --> 00:22:18,383
Activating.

385
00:22:19,686 --> 00:22:21,187
Yes, sir. Felt that.

386
00:22:21,189 --> 00:22:23,892
His head's all ready.
Next victim, please.

387
00:22:25,058 --> 00:22:28,059
- Call sign "Bugs," sir.
- Bugs?

388
00:22:28,061 --> 00:22:31,832
- Sting like a bee...
- That's original. Sit down.

389
00:22:34,567 --> 00:22:36,904
- Initializing.
- I got it.

390
00:22:38,873 --> 00:22:40,206
Activating.

391
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,442
Stung you?

392
00:22:44,444 --> 00:22:45,611
I can handle it.

393
00:22:45,613 --> 00:22:47,782
Okay. Next victim.

394
00:22:49,884 --> 00:22:52,617
Call sign "Badger," sir.

395
00:22:52,619 --> 00:22:54,388
Have a seat.

396
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:01,526
- Initializing.
- Activating.

397
00:23:04,265 --> 00:23:07,900
- Feels good.
- Feels good. Okay.

398
00:23:07,902 --> 00:23:09,768
We're all set.

399
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:13,171
So, we're
ready to test them out?

400
00:23:13,173 --> 00:23:14,472
Yes, sir.

401
00:23:14,474 --> 00:23:16,575
You heard the man.
Climb into your Armada.

402
00:23:16,577 --> 00:23:18,044
Yes, sir!

403
00:23:18,046 --> 00:23:19,411
All right, let's lock
and load! Let's go!

404
00:23:19,413 --> 00:23:20,946
You heard the man!

405
00:23:20,948 --> 00:23:22,717
Let's go, let's go!
We ain't got time!

406
00:23:49,343 --> 00:23:52,545
Their exoskeletons
have calcified exponentially,

407
00:23:52,547 --> 00:23:55,881
presumably due to the increased
temperature in the core.

408
00:23:55,883 --> 00:23:57,615
Blaming it
on global warming?

409
00:23:57,617 --> 00:24:00,753
Bone density isn't singular
like a normal organism.

410
00:24:00,755 --> 00:24:02,854
It's layered.

411
00:24:02,856 --> 00:24:04,890
Compared to the last ones,

412
00:24:04,892 --> 00:24:07,793
these ones are making them
look like crickets.

413
00:24:07,795 --> 00:24:11,229
This hedomorph is truly
an incredible creature.

414
00:24:11,231 --> 00:24:13,465
What is it with you?

415
00:24:13,467 --> 00:24:14,967
What?

416
00:24:14,969 --> 00:24:17,202
I don't know.
You seem to admire these things.

417
00:24:17,204 --> 00:24:20,738
I'm studying the physical form
of an unknown alien species.

418
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:23,275
These hedomorphs have killed
millions of people, okay?

419
00:24:23,277 --> 00:24:25,043
Forgive me if
I'm not fascinated.

420
00:24:25,045 --> 00:24:26,978
Yeah, and you need
to understand your enemy

421
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,450
in order to defeat them.

422
00:24:38,526 --> 00:24:40,028
I know enough.

423
00:24:41,862 --> 00:24:43,629
Why are you even here?

424
00:24:43,631 --> 00:24:46,097
I was looking
for an LDO to add

425
00:24:46,099 --> 00:24:47,533
to the Bots' matrix interface,

426
00:24:47,535 --> 00:24:49,468
but apparently they have
changed everything.

427
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:51,903
Why an LDO?
What would that do?

428
00:24:51,905 --> 00:24:55,475
It'll help with the respond
to the RR and with compliance.

429
00:24:55,477 --> 00:24:59,112
Not by much, but at this point,
I'll take what we can get.

430
00:24:59,114 --> 00:24:59,911
Mm.

431
00:24:59,913 --> 00:25:01,814
Now General Worthington,

432
00:25:01,816 --> 00:25:06,084
he seems pretty willing
to sacrifice his pilots.

433
00:25:06,086 --> 00:25:07,419
You know him better than I do.

434
00:25:07,421 --> 00:25:09,087
Can we trust him
not to push them too far?

435
00:25:09,089 --> 00:25:11,055
No, he knows what
they're capable of.

436
00:25:11,057 --> 00:25:12,757
I wouldn't underestimate them.

437
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:14,227
They're tougher
than you think.

438
00:25:14,229 --> 00:25:15,594
This is not about being tough.

439
00:25:15,596 --> 00:25:18,229
When you link
into the Bots' matrix,

440
00:25:18,231 --> 00:25:20,132
it's a whole other level
of strength that's required.

441
00:25:20,134 --> 00:25:22,534
And I know these Armadas
better than anyone else.

442
00:25:22,536 --> 00:25:24,569
You did.

443
00:25:24,571 --> 00:25:26,505
Been out of the game
for a while now, Roth.

444
00:25:26,507 --> 00:25:29,074
I noticed. I spent years

445
00:25:29,076 --> 00:25:31,709
coding and programming
these things to a T.

446
00:25:31,711 --> 00:25:33,778
I come back, and there's
Mickey Mouse code on it.

447
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:37,984
Listen, I know it doesn't
look like it used to.

448
00:25:37,986 --> 00:25:40,052
But we've made
considerable progress.

449
00:25:40,054 --> 00:25:42,287
The Armadas are the best
they're gonna be.

450
00:25:42,289 --> 00:25:43,956
Obviously not.

451
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:47,394
Otherwise they wouldn't
have brought me back.

452
00:26:48,821 --> 00:26:50,424
I'm linked in.

453
00:26:54,461 --> 00:26:57,228
Okay, Hammer, when you move,
don't just physically move.

454
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:00,099
I want you to consciously
concentrate on the movement.

455
00:27:00,101 --> 00:27:01,767
The neural-interface
will work faster

456
00:27:01,769 --> 00:27:03,536
with your brain motor impulse.

457
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:04,836
Make sense?

458
00:27:04,838 --> 00:27:07,008
I think so.

459
00:27:14,448 --> 00:27:15,917
Okay.

460
00:27:17,451 --> 00:27:20,255
Now you need to get a grasp
on the delay time, okay?

461
00:27:24,825 --> 00:27:26,624
Bugs and Badger,
you do the same.

462
00:27:26,626 --> 00:27:28,860
Come up with a movement
for your Bot.

463
00:27:28,862 --> 00:27:32,033
- Copy.
- Copy.

464
00:27:38,672 --> 00:27:40,104
Keep working with it.

465
00:27:40,106 --> 00:27:42,475
You guys have to compensate
for the lag time.

466
00:27:42,477 --> 00:27:44,412
It's the only thing that's
gonna save your life out there.

467
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:49,980
Okay, let's check on
your weapons systems now.

468
00:27:49,982 --> 00:27:52,486
All right!
Party time.

469
00:27:57,357 --> 00:27:59,290
There's no delay
in the weapons system.

470
00:27:59,292 --> 00:28:01,893
We have that going for us.
Pilots!

471
00:28:01,895 --> 00:28:04,529
<i>Begin prep
and final diagnostics!</i>

472
00:28:04,531 --> 00:28:06,532
<i>The creature is holding
its position,</i>

473
00:28:06,534 --> 00:28:08,199
<i>and we are still unsure
of its intentions,</i>

474
00:28:08,201 --> 00:28:10,235
<i>but it's causing
mass destruction</i>

475
00:28:10,237 --> 00:28:12,904
<i>and we need to get you
into the field.</i>

476
00:28:12,906 --> 00:28:15,306
Begin initial on sequence.

477
00:28:15,308 --> 00:28:16,677
- <i>Roger.</i>
- Copy.

478
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,182
Retract orbital arms.

479
00:28:25,184 --> 00:28:27,652
<i>Main engines start.</i>

480
00:28:27,654 --> 00:28:29,188
Copy that.

481
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:31,993
Ready to launch.
I say again, ready to launch.

482
00:28:33,126 --> 00:28:35,059
We're clear to lift off.

483
00:28:35,061 --> 00:28:36,761
All right!

484
00:28:36,763 --> 00:28:38,565
Engage boosters.

485
00:28:58,419 --> 00:29:01,355
Mom, I'm scared!

486
00:29:04,223 --> 00:29:06,324
It's okay.
It's going to be okay.

487
00:29:06,326 --> 00:29:08,496
We just need to
get out of town.

488
00:29:17,037 --> 00:29:19,103
Mom, watch out!

489
00:29:19,105 --> 00:29:21,507
Mom, we're gonna die here.

490
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:23,775
Sam, we have to stay calm.

491
00:29:23,777 --> 00:29:26,210
Everyone's getting out
of their car!

492
00:29:26,212 --> 00:29:28,980
To where?
We have to stay here.

493
00:29:28,982 --> 00:29:32,250
And get crushed like a bug?
No! We're leaving!

494
00:29:32,252 --> 00:29:35,490
Sam... Damn it.

495
00:29:39,526 --> 00:29:40,628
Sam!

496
00:29:43,931 --> 00:29:46,131
We're still a couple
of miles out from the contact.

497
00:29:46,133 --> 00:29:47,932
How's everybody doing?

498
00:29:47,934 --> 00:29:51,269
<i>Helm is a little slow
to respond, but I can deal.</i>

499
00:29:51,271 --> 00:29:54,405
<i>This Bot
is barely responsive.</i>

500
00:29:54,407 --> 00:29:55,740
Yeah.

501
00:29:55,742 --> 00:29:58,043
Let's get a little practice
in along the way,

502
00:29:58,045 --> 00:30:01,082
work out all the kinks now
before we engage this thing.

503
00:30:25,538 --> 00:30:27,674
You guys getting
the hang of the lag time?

504
00:30:29,676 --> 00:30:31,411
<i>Affirmative, sir.</i>

505
00:30:32,846 --> 00:30:35,346
<i>It's taking
some getting used to,</i>

506
00:30:35,348 --> 00:30:38,249
<i>but we'll be okay.</i>

507
00:30:39,854 --> 00:30:42,053
Bugs? Badger?

508
00:30:42,055 --> 00:30:44,826
- <i>Yeah, I'm good, sir.</i>
- <i>Same.</i>

509
00:30:56,435 --> 00:31:00,271
Giant Killer,
we have visual on the bogey.

510
00:31:00,273 --> 00:31:02,641
I say again, we have
visual on the bogey.

511
00:31:02,643 --> 00:31:05,579
And it's a lot bigger
than I thought.

512
00:31:09,817 --> 00:31:12,586
General, this lag time
is gonna kill 'em.

513
00:31:14,755 --> 00:31:17,456
You really want them operating
without full control?

514
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:19,357
They'll be fine, Dr. Roth.

515
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:20,825
Giant Killer?

516
00:31:20,827 --> 00:31:23,193
<i>Awaiting instructions,
Giant Killer.</i>

517
00:31:23,195 --> 00:31:25,096
You are clear
to engage, Hammer!

518
00:31:25,098 --> 00:31:27,699
I say again,
you are clear to engage!

519
00:31:27,701 --> 00:31:32,069
You heard the man.
We're clear to engage.

520
00:31:32,071 --> 00:31:33,372
Roger.

521
00:31:33,374 --> 00:31:35,440
Solid copy.

522
00:31:35,442 --> 00:31:39,612
Badger, Bugs, cover me.
I'm sending in rockets.

523
00:31:39,614 --> 00:31:40,914
Copy that.

524
00:31:51,992 --> 00:31:53,560
Bam!

525
00:32:03,303 --> 00:32:07,072
Giant Killer?
Direct hit on bogey.

526
00:32:07,074 --> 00:32:09,274
I say again, direct hit!

527
00:32:09,276 --> 00:32:12,276
Good job, Hammer!

528
00:32:12,278 --> 00:32:14,946
Can you confirm
the creature is deceased?

529
00:32:14,948 --> 00:32:18,286
We'll move in for
a closer look, Giant Killer.

530
00:32:29,997 --> 00:32:33,430
- <i>Did you guys see that?</i>
- Yeah.

531
00:32:33,432 --> 00:32:35,603
<i>What does that mean?</i>

532
00:32:45,946 --> 00:32:47,711
It's not dead, guys!

533
00:32:47,713 --> 00:32:50,548
<i>Giant killer!
The bogey is not deceased!</i>

534
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,886
<i>I say again,
it is not deceased.</i>

535
00:33:02,262 --> 00:33:04,497
This thing is getting
slower and slower!

536
00:33:16,643 --> 00:33:19,678
I've... I've got a problem.

537
00:33:21,647 --> 00:33:24,382
My control panel
is shorting out.

538
00:33:24,384 --> 00:33:26,420
I think I'm losing power.

539
00:33:31,125 --> 00:33:32,826
Is that Dad?

540
00:33:37,064 --> 00:33:38,798
What just happened?

541
00:33:42,303 --> 00:33:44,001
Giant Killer?

542
00:33:44,003 --> 00:33:45,270
- Sam...
- Is it over?

543
00:33:45,272 --> 00:33:47,440
Sam, we need to go!
We need to go!

544
00:33:55,082 --> 00:33:57,582
Guys! Guys! Guys!

545
00:33:57,584 --> 00:33:59,817
I need... I need help!

546
00:33:59,819 --> 00:34:02,321
I need...
I need your help!

547
00:34:02,323 --> 00:34:04,757
I'm having a hard time
breathing.

548
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:09,461
We've lost radio contact
with Armada One!

549
00:34:09,463 --> 00:34:11,662
It's shutting down,
going off-line!

550
00:34:11,664 --> 00:34:13,298
Life support is failing!

551
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,798
I can't do anything
from here.

552
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,934
I have to get out there.
It's not a system error!

553
00:34:16,936 --> 00:34:19,670
It's a physical problem
aboard the Bot!

554
00:34:19,672 --> 00:34:22,074
Hammer, what's going
on in there?

555
00:34:22,076 --> 00:34:24,344
Hang on, Hammer!

556
00:34:26,512 --> 00:34:27,981
I'm coming, Hammer!

557
00:34:30,349 --> 00:34:32,016
Bugs, watch out!

558
00:34:32,018 --> 00:34:35,054
Yeah, yeah, I know.

559
00:34:35,056 --> 00:34:36,755
Bugs, stay on this thing!

560
00:34:36,757 --> 00:34:38,990
I'm gonna go and cover Hammer!

561
00:34:38,992 --> 00:34:42,430
General, I have to get
out there, please! Right now!

562
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:45,465
Russo.

563
00:34:46,934 --> 00:34:48,967
Lee, Wright. Let's go!
Let's boogie!

564
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:52,470
Dr. Horowitz, I need one
of you to stay here.

565
00:34:52,472 --> 00:34:54,108
- Hey!
- Doctor!

566
00:34:55,543 --> 00:34:57,242
Sorry, Doctor.
We can't let you do that.

567
00:34:57,244 --> 00:34:58,744
It's too dangerous.

568
00:34:58,746 --> 00:35:01,112
I did a four-year residency
in a trauma ward.

569
00:35:01,114 --> 00:35:03,447
We do not have time
for this shit.

570
00:35:03,449 --> 00:35:06,284
- We need to go.
- Hammer needs me there.

571
00:35:06,286 --> 00:35:08,287
I'll shadow her, Russo.

572
00:35:08,289 --> 00:35:09,686
But stay close.

573
00:35:09,688 --> 00:35:12,359
Let's go!
Let's go!

574
00:35:15,094 --> 00:35:16,693
<i>You okay
in there, Bugs?</i>

575
00:35:16,695 --> 00:35:18,465
Yeah, I'm good.

576
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,672
Holy cow.

577
00:35:26,974 --> 00:35:28,340
That's all right,
we'll be fine.

578
00:35:28,342 --> 00:35:30,010
Almost there.

579
00:35:34,081 --> 00:35:35,950
Son of a...

580
00:35:41,188 --> 00:35:42,490
Shit!

581
00:35:44,356 --> 00:35:46,557
Stay calm, Doctor,
stay calm.

582
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:48,392
Oh, my God.

583
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:55,333
I didn't know
they made them that big.

584
00:35:55,335 --> 00:35:56,469
It's crazy.

585
00:35:57,637 --> 00:35:59,172
Hit the gas!

586
00:36:01,041 --> 00:36:04,275
We're all right.
Almost there. Easy.

587
00:36:04,277 --> 00:36:06,447
How's our six doing, Wright?

588
00:36:19,492 --> 00:36:21,659
Wright, you're on six.

589
00:36:21,661 --> 00:36:23,094
Look, look! Hold on, hold on.
You can see air.

590
00:36:23,096 --> 00:36:24,496
What?

591
00:36:24,498 --> 00:36:26,197
Air coming
out of his cockpit.

592
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:28,266
That's the oxygen supply.

593
00:36:28,268 --> 00:36:29,568
How do we fix it?

594
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,168
These robots,
they're equipped with

595
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:33,704
tank units,
just like spacecraft.

596
00:36:33,706 --> 00:36:36,206
The impact from the attack
probably knocked out

597
00:36:36,208 --> 00:36:37,876
the filtration, right?

598
00:36:37,878 --> 00:36:39,911
So we have to seal the valve.

599
00:36:39,913 --> 00:36:41,880
So what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna try to salvage

600
00:36:41,882 --> 00:36:46,117
the ECU to get
the Armada back online.

601
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:49,121
Okay, you do that.
I'm gonna take care of Hammer.

602
00:36:51,824 --> 00:36:55,827
Damn it, Bugs!
Shoot the damn thing!

603
00:36:55,829 --> 00:36:57,496
You're too close
for the missile.

604
00:36:57,498 --> 00:36:59,530
I'm gonna have
to use the Gatling.

605
00:36:59,532 --> 00:37:01,733
That's fine.
Just do something!

606
00:37:01,735 --> 00:37:04,003
Engaging the Gatling guns.

607
00:37:05,271 --> 00:37:08,007
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

608
00:37:09,608 --> 00:37:11,510
- Yes, sir.
- Lee?

609
00:37:11,512 --> 00:37:13,545
- I'm on it, Russo.
- Hold it down.

610
00:37:13,547 --> 00:37:15,949
I'm going up.

611
00:37:22,188 --> 00:37:25,289
Hammer!
Hammer!

612
00:37:25,291 --> 00:37:26,759
No response.

613
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:34,566
The cockpit
is filled with gas.

614
00:37:34,568 --> 00:37:36,568
We have to get Hammer
out of there.

615
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:38,572
Roth, you too.

616
00:37:50,182 --> 00:37:51,284
Hammer.

617
00:37:52,985 --> 00:37:55,619
- Hammer!
- Oh, my God.

618
00:37:58,992 --> 00:38:00,291
Hammer!

619
00:38:00,293 --> 00:38:02,760
- I got it, go fix the ECU.
- I'm on it!

620
00:38:02,762 --> 00:38:04,396
- Stay with me, please.
- Hang in there, baby.

621
00:38:04,398 --> 00:38:06,130
- Look at me.
- Come on!

622
00:38:06,132 --> 00:38:07,831
Hammer!

623
00:38:07,833 --> 00:38:10,670
I don't have a pulse.
Get my medical bag!

624
00:38:12,405 --> 00:38:13,604
Hang on, buddy.

625
00:38:13,606 --> 00:38:15,505
Hang on. Don't you give up.

626
00:38:15,507 --> 00:38:17,075
- We got you!
- Come on, man!

627
00:38:17,077 --> 00:38:20,045
Roth! It's getting
real hard to breathe!

628
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,880
Stay with us!

629
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,615
- Come on!
- Don't you give up now.

630
00:38:23,617 --> 00:38:26,150
Stay with me.

631
00:38:26,152 --> 00:38:27,952
Come on!

632
00:38:27,954 --> 00:38:30,121
Come on.

633
00:38:30,123 --> 00:38:32,025
Hammer, come on.

634
00:38:34,827 --> 00:38:37,295
- We took too long.
- God damn it!

635
00:38:37,297 --> 00:38:40,398
He's dead.
He's dead. We gotta go.

636
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,800
We'll take him with us.
We can't just leave him.

637
00:38:42,802 --> 00:38:44,903
We don't got time!
We gotta go,

638
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,637
or we're all gonna suffocate.

639
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:48,275
Go, go!

640
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,018
I'll stay and clean up.

641
00:39:09,228 --> 00:39:11,095
The entire human species
working together

642
00:39:11,097 --> 00:39:13,099
couldn't take this thing out.

643
00:39:15,168 --> 00:39:18,369
Damn it, Bugs!
What in the hell are you doing?

644
00:39:18,371 --> 00:39:20,472
<i>Badger, use your missiles!</i>

645
00:39:20,474 --> 00:39:22,574
Negative!
It's too risky!

646
00:39:22,576 --> 00:39:23,773
Release it!

647
00:39:23,775 --> 00:39:25,443
<i>You have a clear shot!</i>

648
00:39:25,445 --> 00:39:26,610
<i>Blow this son of a bitch away!</i>

649
00:39:26,612 --> 00:39:28,348
<i>I can't hold onto him forever!</i>

650
00:39:31,585 --> 00:39:33,485
Missiles away!

651
00:39:33,487 --> 00:39:34,818
<i>Disengage!</i>

652
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,554
Take cover! Take cover!
Take cover!

653
00:39:54,407 --> 00:39:56,173
The creature is down!

654
00:39:56,175 --> 00:39:59,443
I say again,
the creature is down!

655
00:39:59,445 --> 00:40:01,248
Giant Killer, copy!

656
00:40:03,916 --> 00:40:06,450
We have visual confirmation.

657
00:40:06,452 --> 00:40:08,019
Good work, Mr. Russo.

658
00:40:08,021 --> 00:40:09,686
<i>What's the status on Hammer?</i>

659
00:40:09,688 --> 00:40:12,690
Mr. Russo,
where is Hammer?

660
00:40:12,692 --> 00:40:15,262
I say again, where
is Hammer?

661
00:40:21,634 --> 00:40:23,334
Where's Hammer?

662
00:40:23,336 --> 00:40:24,838
He's dead.

663
00:40:26,472 --> 00:40:28,139
What?

664
00:40:28,141 --> 00:40:30,043
No!

665
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,347
No!

666
00:40:36,349 --> 00:40:38,085
Damn!

667
00:40:39,985 --> 00:40:42,586
All right, I gotta
get a closer look.

668
00:40:42,588 --> 00:40:44,121
No, no, no.

669
00:40:44,123 --> 00:40:46,124
Look! Look, I have
to get closer, okay?

670
00:40:46,126 --> 00:40:48,124
If there are more things
out there like this,

671
00:40:48,126 --> 00:40:50,230
I have to learn
everything I can!

672
00:41:02,742 --> 00:41:04,445
You are killing me.

673
00:41:07,179 --> 00:41:09,579
Bugs and Badger,
Bugs and Badger, this is Russo.

674
00:41:09,581 --> 00:41:13,784
ASAP, ASAP,
I need overview.

675
00:41:13,786 --> 00:41:15,787
Copy, Giant Killer!

676
00:41:15,789 --> 00:41:17,758
Copy.

677
00:41:21,393 --> 00:41:22,428
Let's go.

678
00:41:32,172 --> 00:41:35,474
This doesn't...
This doesn't look good.

679
00:41:35,476 --> 00:41:37,575
- Run!
- This doesn't look good.

680
00:41:37,577 --> 00:41:39,077
- Go, go, go!
- Fall back!

681
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,644
- Take cover, go!
- Go, go, go!

682
00:41:40,646 --> 00:41:43,313
Fall back! Cover, cover,
cover! Fall in! Fall in!

683
00:41:43,315 --> 00:41:46,419
Armada, Armada,
multiple hostile movers!

684
00:42:10,409 --> 00:42:12,078
No! No!

685
00:42:13,512 --> 00:42:15,646
No! No!

686
00:42:18,818 --> 00:42:20,452
Ah!

687
00:42:32,297 --> 00:42:35,032
<i>Bugs, Badger, hold fire!</i>

688
00:42:35,034 --> 00:42:36,633
<i>Abort, abort!</i>

689
00:42:36,635 --> 00:42:38,204
Copy, Giant Killer.

690
00:42:41,875 --> 00:42:44,041
Bugs, where are you?

691
00:42:44,043 --> 00:42:45,945
I'm here!

692
00:42:48,914 --> 00:42:51,014
All right.

693
00:42:51,016 --> 00:42:52,351
Returning to base!

694
00:43:03,563 --> 00:43:05,863
Oh, God! Okay.

695
00:43:05,865 --> 00:43:07,065
Alex? Alex?

696
00:43:07,067 --> 00:43:08,700
- Karen?
- Are you okay?

697
00:43:08,702 --> 00:43:09,800
<i>Look, I'm fine.</i>

698
00:43:09,802 --> 00:43:11,369
Karen, are you
out of the city?

699
00:43:11,371 --> 00:43:12,470
<i>No.</i>

700
00:43:12,472 --> 00:43:14,537
We're looking
for a pheno-bunker.

701
00:43:14,539 --> 00:43:15,907
<i>Are you still driving?</i>

702
00:43:15,909 --> 00:43:18,476
No, we had to go on foot.

703
00:43:18,478 --> 00:43:20,878
<i>Karen, no!
You cannot be on foot!</i>

704
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,180
I mean, we're okay
for the moment.

705
00:43:23,182 --> 00:43:26,016
It got really quiet.
Did you guys kill it?

706
00:43:26,018 --> 00:43:27,517
<i>You need to get off
the streets!</i>

707
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:29,054
Mom...

708
00:43:29,056 --> 00:43:30,387
<i>Find a room, lock
yourselves in there now!</i>

709
00:43:30,389 --> 00:43:32,090
- <i>I'll come for you.</i>
- Okay...

710
00:43:32,092 --> 00:43:33,458
- Mom!
- What?

711
00:43:35,961 --> 00:43:37,827
Shit, shit!

712
00:43:37,829 --> 00:43:39,496
Karen!

713
00:43:39,498 --> 00:43:40,600
Damn it!

714
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:47,003
We'll reorganize,

715
00:43:47,005 --> 00:43:49,373
mobilize ground troops.

716
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:53,077
We'll send the Armadas back
out as overwatch.

717
00:43:53,079 --> 00:43:55,880
The ground troops can
go building to building,

718
00:43:55,882 --> 00:43:59,516
street to street
to clear the insects.

719
00:43:59,518 --> 00:44:03,354
We can't let them
get too far inland.

720
00:44:03,356 --> 00:44:06,092
We'll never be able
to contain them.

721
00:44:07,193 --> 00:44:09,461
Negative.
Absolutely not.

722
00:44:09,463 --> 00:44:11,795
No, that means way too many
casualties, General.

723
00:44:11,797 --> 00:44:13,863
Civilians are bound to get
caught up in the crossfire.

724
00:44:13,865 --> 00:44:15,668
It's too risky.

725
00:44:21,708 --> 00:44:23,673
We're moving to Phase Two.

726
00:44:23,675 --> 00:44:25,275
Copy.

727
00:44:25,277 --> 00:44:27,580
We'll implement Phase Two.

728
00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:32,019
Anyone care to tell me
what Phase Two is?

729
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:40,657
It's me, Dr. Roth.

730
00:44:40,659 --> 00:44:42,927
Bioweapons.

731
00:44:42,929 --> 00:44:45,595
You gotta be kidding me.

732
00:44:45,597 --> 00:44:46,865
Biological warfare?

733
00:44:46,867 --> 00:44:48,599
You can't come up
with another alternative?

734
00:44:48,601 --> 00:44:50,333
Like send in
an air strike or something?

735
00:44:50,335 --> 00:44:51,869
We did that.
It didn't work.

736
00:44:51,871 --> 00:44:53,403
Well, whatever the hell
you're gonna use,

737
00:44:53,405 --> 00:44:54,673
it's gonna go everywhere.

738
00:44:54,675 --> 00:44:56,474
You're talking about
a major fallout.

739
00:44:56,476 --> 00:44:59,376
Dr. Roth, I'm not gonna
drop a carpet bomb, okay?

740
00:44:59,378 --> 00:45:01,447
I'm gonna target
the creatures specifically.

741
00:45:15,161 --> 00:45:17,664
The Armadas are back.

742
00:45:33,679 --> 00:45:36,880
What is it that
you require, Dr. Horowitz,

743
00:45:36,882 --> 00:45:39,450
to begin Phase Two?

744
00:45:39,452 --> 00:45:41,786
I'm gonna need
one of the spiders.

745
00:45:41,788 --> 00:45:44,157
I need to know what
we're dealing with.

746
00:45:47,059 --> 00:45:48,693
I don't care
what the U.N. thinks.

747
00:45:48,695 --> 00:45:50,163
Pull it up.

748
00:45:57,269 --> 00:46:01,007
I'm sorry, sir.
We did what we could.

749
00:46:02,541 --> 00:46:06,110
Yeah.
I mean... you did.

750
00:46:06,112 --> 00:46:09,179
You did what you could.

751
00:46:11,217 --> 00:46:14,619
We're gonna move forward
with Phase Two now.

752
00:46:14,621 --> 00:46:17,255
Get some rest until
you're needed again.

753
00:46:17,257 --> 00:46:19,257
Badger, keep an eye on her,
will you?

754
00:46:19,259 --> 00:46:20,590
Will do, sir.

755
00:46:20,592 --> 00:46:22,596
Get yourself checked
out by a medic.

756
00:46:29,702 --> 00:46:33,371
I need a perimeter set
around the outskirts of town.

757
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:38,376
I want anything with more
than two legs killed on sight!

758
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:40,180
Copy.

759
00:46:55,762 --> 00:46:57,530
Prepared to do anything?

760
00:46:58,931 --> 00:47:00,264
We both are.

761
00:47:00,266 --> 00:47:01,699
We need you.

762
00:47:01,701 --> 00:47:03,566
You understand the robots
better than anyone else,

763
00:47:03,568 --> 00:47:05,403
and that's exactly
why you're here.

764
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:07,905
But you need to learn
how to follow the rules,

765
00:47:07,907 --> 00:47:09,639
and I make the rules.

766
00:47:09,641 --> 00:47:11,474
How is it that you make
the rules about

767
00:47:11,476 --> 00:47:13,010
what the Armadas
can and cannot do

768
00:47:13,012 --> 00:47:15,612
when you yourself admit that
I know more about them?

769
00:47:15,614 --> 00:47:17,882
Yes, but you're skeptical.

770
00:47:17,884 --> 00:47:19,483
You're full of doubt.

771
00:47:19,485 --> 00:47:22,820
And I know that those robots
are more capable than you think.

772
00:47:22,822 --> 00:47:24,088
They could have been
if Hallstrom

773
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:25,690
had let me finish my work.

774
00:47:25,692 --> 00:47:30,327
Hey, I completely agree
with you, okay?

775
00:47:30,329 --> 00:47:32,896
And on a separate note,
I admit, you know,

776
00:47:32,898 --> 00:47:35,566
you're not who
I expected you to be either.

777
00:47:35,568 --> 00:47:38,601
Did you say something
nice to me?

778
00:47:38,603 --> 00:47:42,574
I'm just saying I'm sorry
that I misjudged you

779
00:47:42,576 --> 00:47:44,242
- when I first met you.
- You misjudged me?

780
00:47:44,244 --> 00:47:46,709
With all due respect, you
do carry a certain reputation.

781
00:47:46,711 --> 00:47:47,744
I do?

782
00:47:47,746 --> 00:47:50,382
You threw
a chair out the window.

783
00:47:51,784 --> 00:47:52,719
Yeah.

784
00:47:54,153 --> 00:47:58,755
I need to know, if I can
synthesize a targeted bioweapon,

785
00:47:58,757 --> 00:48:00,691
would you be able to
reformat the Armadas

786
00:48:00,693 --> 00:48:02,827
and disperse
everything effectively?

787
00:48:02,829 --> 00:48:06,697
I would have to expend
the resonance

788
00:48:06,699 --> 00:48:09,635
to amplify the power output.
But, yes, it's doable.

789
00:48:10,836 --> 00:48:11,838
Good.

790
00:48:34,126 --> 00:48:36,559
Lee, ridge.

791
00:48:36,561 --> 00:48:38,197
On it.

792
00:48:39,431 --> 00:48:40,798
What are we doing here?

793
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,099
Planning an ambush.

794
00:48:42,101 --> 00:48:43,633
We gotta get a vantage
point on those damn spiders,

795
00:48:43,635 --> 00:48:45,103
figure out where they're at.

796
00:48:45,105 --> 00:48:47,539
Where they're grouping,
where they're going to.

797
00:48:47,541 --> 00:48:49,376
Get the stragglers
and the weak ones.

798
00:48:51,244 --> 00:48:52,476
How about you?

799
00:48:52,478 --> 00:48:54,677
How'd you end up
running this team?

800
00:48:54,679 --> 00:48:56,546
Uh...

801
00:48:56,548 --> 00:48:59,217
My team was attacked by
these things near San Diego.

802
00:48:59,219 --> 00:49:01,651
I'd been appointed to the DOD

803
00:49:01,653 --> 00:49:04,858
on scientific
special operations.

804
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,360
My people died because
I hesitated on utilizing

805
00:49:09,362 --> 00:49:12,929
human assets in a war
we were already losing.

806
00:49:12,931 --> 00:49:18,204
I said retreat when
I should have said attack.

807
00:49:21,507 --> 00:49:24,141
I was the only
survivor that day.

808
00:49:24,143 --> 00:49:28,244
It made be a bit of an expert
with DIA, DOD and POTUS.

809
00:49:28,246 --> 00:49:31,014
We understand risk, Roth.

810
00:49:31,016 --> 00:49:33,485
It's all we have left.

811
00:49:37,222 --> 00:49:38,588
How's it looking?

812
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:40,791
They're staying
together offshore

813
00:49:40,793 --> 00:49:42,459
but we got a few small groups
that are breaking off

814
00:49:42,461 --> 00:49:44,394
and they are headed into town.

815
00:49:44,396 --> 00:49:46,930
We're gonna get
a little company.

816
00:49:46,932 --> 00:49:48,499
It's gonna heat up here
pretty quick, guys!

817
00:49:48,501 --> 00:49:50,001
Let's go ahead and
get doctors back to lab!

818
00:49:50,003 --> 00:49:51,001
Copy that.

819
00:49:51,003 --> 00:49:51,971
I'm not going back in.

820
00:49:54,507 --> 00:49:55,805
Absolutely not.

821
00:49:55,807 --> 00:49:58,541
It's way too dangerous
out there.

822
00:49:58,543 --> 00:49:59,675
They're everywhere.

823
00:49:59,677 --> 00:50:01,278
We'll get you your spider.

824
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,914
Back to the lab.
Let's go.

825
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:05,483
And what if you can't get
a spider back to the lab?

826
00:50:05,485 --> 00:50:07,985
What if I need to take a
tissue sample from the field?

827
00:50:07,987 --> 00:50:10,121
Are you familiar with
taking tissue samples

828
00:50:10,123 --> 00:50:12,759
from the field and gathering
them yourself, Mr. Russo?

829
00:50:15,128 --> 00:50:17,729
Lee, Wright.
Check that.

830
00:50:17,731 --> 00:50:19,729
We'll take Dr. Roth
back to lab,

831
00:50:19,731 --> 00:50:22,432
and we will head back out.

832
00:50:22,434 --> 00:50:24,267
No, I'm not
going anywhere.

833
00:50:24,269 --> 00:50:25,735
It's a waste of valuable time.

834
00:50:25,737 --> 00:50:28,607
Besides, I could stay here
and help out Horowitz.

835
00:50:30,309 --> 00:50:31,811
There! There!

836
00:50:33,413 --> 00:50:34,679
Mom! Mom!

837
00:50:34,681 --> 00:50:37,650
Sam, run! Run!

838
00:50:46,759 --> 00:50:48,327
Go! Go!

839
00:50:55,835 --> 00:50:57,336
Okay, okay.

840
00:51:00,407 --> 00:51:01,539
Mom?

841
00:51:01,541 --> 00:51:03,474
It's okay. We just...

842
00:51:03,476 --> 00:51:05,909
We just need
to find a locked room.

843
00:51:05,911 --> 00:51:07,547
Come on!
Come on!

844
00:51:17,822 --> 00:51:19,458
Russo!

845
00:51:21,494 --> 00:51:24,126
I got activity in front
of that house.

846
00:51:24,128 --> 00:51:26,532
I don't like this.

847
00:51:28,467 --> 00:51:29,766
- Easy! Easy!
- I got 'em!

848
00:51:29,768 --> 00:51:31,267
- Stand down.
- I can take 'em!

849
00:51:31,269 --> 00:51:32,670
Stand down!

850
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:34,938
Whoa!

851
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:38,309
We do not have the firepower
or the manpower

852
00:51:38,311 --> 00:51:40,311
to take these things on
in numbers.

853
00:51:40,313 --> 00:51:43,546
They're tearing this guy up,
you kidding me?

854
00:51:43,548 --> 00:51:46,550
Anything happens to you
or Dr. Horowitz,

855
00:51:46,552 --> 00:51:48,387
this mission is a failure.

856
00:51:49,922 --> 00:51:53,124
Our best shot is to get
one of these spiders alone,

857
00:51:53,126 --> 00:51:54,861
preferably dead.

858
00:51:56,563 --> 00:51:59,932
We can't get into a firefight
with these things in numbers.

859
00:52:05,036 --> 00:52:06,105
Look!

860
00:52:18,751 --> 00:52:20,918
- Wright, stay with 'em.
- Got it.

861
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,423
- Lee, stay tight.
- On you.

862
00:52:44,909 --> 00:52:46,879
- Lee.
- I see 'em.

863
00:52:52,684 --> 00:52:55,251
- I got one by itself.
- Got two to the left!

864
00:52:55,253 --> 00:52:57,521
On my five!

865
00:52:57,523 --> 00:52:58,988
Three, one!

866
00:53:05,697 --> 00:53:07,496
Help!
We need help!

867
00:53:07,498 --> 00:53:09,101
- On it!
- Wright!

868
00:53:14,206 --> 00:53:16,075
What happened?

869
00:53:20,512 --> 00:53:22,211
Roth! Roth!
Get back here!

870
00:53:22,213 --> 00:53:23,615
Where are you going?

871
00:53:24,851 --> 00:53:27,686
Russo! Wright is down!
Roth is coming to you!

872
00:53:36,228 --> 00:53:38,762
How'd you learn
to shoot like that?

873
00:53:38,764 --> 00:53:40,863
I'm from New York.

874
00:53:40,865 --> 00:53:42,936
Come on.
Let's bag this thing up.

875
00:53:46,972 --> 00:53:48,641
In the back.

876
00:53:59,385 --> 00:54:00,450
Move!

877
00:54:00,452 --> 00:54:02,489
Go! Go!

878
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,961
Okay.
We'll be okay.

879
00:54:10,963 --> 00:54:13,063
What if those weird
spider things get in here?

880
00:54:13,065 --> 00:54:16,633
Or another like monster comes
and destroys this building?

881
00:54:16,635 --> 00:54:18,302
Sam?

882
00:54:18,304 --> 00:54:20,537
Sam, we're not
gonna freak out, okay?

883
00:54:20,539 --> 00:54:23,340
Look at me.
Take a breath.

884
00:54:23,342 --> 00:54:24,941
Okay.

885
00:54:24,943 --> 00:54:27,543
Your father's gonna
find us, okay?

886
00:54:27,545 --> 00:54:28,681
Got it?

887
00:54:37,322 --> 00:54:39,389
I'm gonna apply
a little bit of pressure.

888
00:54:39,391 --> 00:54:40,824
It might sting a little bit.

889
00:54:40,826 --> 00:54:42,793
- Bring it on.
- Relax.

890
00:54:42,795 --> 00:54:45,628
Relax?
Hammer is dead!

891
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:46,863
We need to get
back out there...

892
00:54:46,865 --> 00:54:48,532
You need to calm down!

893
00:54:48,534 --> 00:54:51,601
I'd really recommend
you relax for a day or two.

894
00:54:51,603 --> 00:54:53,769
To hell with that.

895
00:54:53,771 --> 00:54:55,271
I need to get
back out there now!

896
00:54:55,273 --> 00:54:56,807
Are the Bots ready?

897
00:54:56,809 --> 00:54:58,577
We'll have our chance.

898
00:55:01,246 --> 00:55:02,813
He's dead.

899
00:55:02,815 --> 00:55:04,751
I want them dead.

900
00:55:06,818 --> 00:55:08,755
We knew what
we signed up for.

901
00:55:12,190 --> 00:55:14,092
I just can't
believe he's gone.

902
00:55:17,295 --> 00:55:18,998
I'm not gonna cry.

903
00:55:20,364 --> 00:55:22,100
I'm not gonna cry.

904
00:55:23,902 --> 00:55:25,601
Let me take another look.

905
00:55:25,603 --> 00:55:26,836
No. I need to go now.

906
00:55:26,838 --> 00:55:28,304
I can't release you.

907
00:55:28,306 --> 00:55:31,108
I'm not asking you.

908
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:33,876
Then you're gonna have
to sign some paperwork.

909
00:55:33,878 --> 00:55:35,681
Where's the damn pen?

910
00:55:49,329 --> 00:55:50,363
Doc.

911
00:55:51,429 --> 00:55:53,430
On three, on three.

912
00:55:53,432 --> 00:55:54,932
One, two, three.

913
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:58,635
Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.

914
00:55:58,637 --> 00:55:59,737
Okay. Drop it, guys.
Drop it.

915
00:55:59,739 --> 00:56:01,604
No, we gotta leave it outside.

916
00:56:01,606 --> 00:56:03,273
We still don't know if this
thing's giving anything off.

917
00:56:03,275 --> 00:56:05,041
I don't want to contaminate
the facility.

918
00:56:05,043 --> 00:56:06,809
Let's just bring all
my equipment out here.

919
00:56:06,811 --> 00:56:08,579
All right, got it.
On three, on three.

920
00:56:08,581 --> 00:56:09,849
Three, two.

921
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:14,617
This is Russo,
this is Russo.

922
00:56:14,619 --> 00:56:18,357
I need you to bring down
Dr. Horowitz's equipment ASAP.

923
00:56:19,724 --> 00:56:20,860
Repeat?

924
00:56:24,295 --> 00:56:25,795
You gotta be kidding me.

925
00:56:25,797 --> 00:56:28,034
- Really?
- Copy.

926
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:33,604
You've got a phone call.

927
00:56:33,606 --> 00:56:36,643
I just lost a friend to one of
these things. Make it quick.

928
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:39,844
Hello?

929
00:56:39,846 --> 00:56:42,179
Larry, where the hell
are you, man?

930
00:56:42,181 --> 00:56:44,146
I'm on the way back in.

931
00:56:44,148 --> 00:56:46,182
Listen, man, before
that boat went down,

932
00:56:46,184 --> 00:56:49,253
<i>we got a definite area on where
those things are coming from.</i>

933
00:56:49,255 --> 00:56:51,787
But we got an attack sub
out here ready to go nuclear

934
00:56:51,789 --> 00:56:53,456
and blow these things out!

935
00:56:53,458 --> 00:56:56,260
Do you have any idea
how big the tidal waves

936
00:56:56,262 --> 00:56:57,559
that thing would create?

937
00:56:57,561 --> 00:56:59,195
I get it, I get it.

938
00:56:59,197 --> 00:57:00,831
All right,
what else do you have?

939
00:57:00,833 --> 00:57:03,733
There's much more,
a whole lot more.

940
00:57:03,735 --> 00:57:05,534
There's fucking more
of these things?

941
00:57:05,536 --> 00:57:07,773
Yeah, well, you're the one
who predicted it, right?

942
00:57:09,007 --> 00:57:10,740
I wish I was wrong
about that one.

943
00:57:10,742 --> 00:57:14,644
I know, but what are you guys
doing about these spiders?

944
00:57:14,646 --> 00:57:15,912
And what about the Armada?

945
00:57:15,914 --> 00:57:17,213
We nabbed one of the spiders.

946
00:57:17,215 --> 00:57:19,148
Horowitz is trying
to figure out a pathogen

947
00:57:19,150 --> 00:57:20,950
<i>to kill these things off,
and I'm gonna figure out a way</i>

948
00:57:20,952 --> 00:57:22,885
to adapt it
to the Armadas and deploy it.

949
00:57:22,887 --> 00:57:25,121
Sounds like a plan.

950
00:57:25,123 --> 00:57:27,291
All right, I'll keep you
posted as I know it.

951
00:57:27,293 --> 00:57:29,860
Great.
Glad you're alive.

952
00:57:29,862 --> 00:57:31,864
Me, too.

953
00:57:34,699 --> 00:57:36,168
You done?

954
00:57:40,739 --> 00:57:42,238
There's more?

955
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,175
Yeah.

956
00:57:44,409 --> 00:57:46,543
What do you think?

957
00:57:46,545 --> 00:57:49,079
I think they look like
ordinary arachnids, you know.

958
00:57:49,081 --> 00:57:51,215
With the exception to
their size, of course.

959
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:54,217
That could be due
to radiation or, you know,

960
00:57:54,219 --> 00:57:56,153
we just discovered
a new species.

961
00:57:56,155 --> 00:57:59,555
I won't know anything for sure
until I cut that thing open.

962
00:57:59,557 --> 00:58:01,191
Let's go.

963
00:58:01,193 --> 00:58:03,726
Mr. Secretary, I understand
nobody was prepared.

964
00:58:03,728 --> 00:58:05,595
Yeah, okay.

965
00:58:05,597 --> 00:58:09,465
Look, if you need to mobilize
more ground troops, then do it!

966
00:58:09,467 --> 00:58:13,369
General, Dr. Horowitz's
equipment is set up, sir.

967
00:58:13,371 --> 00:58:15,340
Copy.

968
00:58:28,621 --> 00:58:29,756
Hmm.

969
00:58:32,757 --> 00:58:34,557
Let's see.

970
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:37,059
Okay, so radiation levels
seem to be normal

971
00:58:37,061 --> 00:58:39,262
and it's not emitting
any kind of toxins either.

972
00:58:39,264 --> 00:58:41,134
Well, that's good news.

973
00:58:43,001 --> 00:58:45,837
All right, so let's
take a look inside you.

974
00:58:53,478 --> 00:58:55,247
That thing stinks.

975
00:58:56,748 --> 00:58:59,450
Huh. Well,
this is interesting.

976
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:03,854
There are definitely organs
I can't identify here.

977
00:59:03,856 --> 00:59:06,456
I mean, usually with these
things, you can figure them out

978
00:59:06,458 --> 00:59:08,025
if you have a general
working knowledge of

979
00:59:08,027 --> 00:59:10,096
how the organism works,
but this...

980
00:59:14,867 --> 00:59:17,166
Guys, this isn't
carbon-based.

981
00:59:17,168 --> 00:59:20,871
All life on earth
is carbon-based.

982
00:59:20,873 --> 00:59:21,972
What are you saying,
Doctor?

983
00:59:21,974 --> 00:59:23,173
These things are
not from earth?

984
00:59:23,175 --> 00:59:24,775
Whoa.

985
00:59:24,777 --> 00:59:28,177
So if these things aren't from
earth, then they're aliens.

986
00:59:28,179 --> 00:59:30,246
Well, if you have
another hypothesis,

987
00:59:30,248 --> 00:59:31,949
- I would love to hear it.
- Come on.

988
00:59:31,951 --> 00:59:33,416
Regardless
whether they're aliens,

989
00:59:33,418 --> 00:59:35,651
the issue at hand
is stopping these things!

990
00:59:35,653 --> 00:59:37,121
Of course, General.

991
00:59:37,123 --> 00:59:39,222
Keep me informed, please.

992
00:59:39,224 --> 00:59:41,958
I need to update the
White House on our progress.

993
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,894
Okay, so you see
this gland here?

994
00:59:43,896 --> 00:59:45,295
Yeah.

995
00:59:45,297 --> 00:59:46,996
So usually this would be
used to expel salt

996
00:59:46,998 --> 00:59:48,632
from the body, right?

997
00:59:48,634 --> 00:59:50,367
But it seems to be covered with
to what I can only refer to

998
00:59:50,369 --> 00:59:53,503
as some sort of reverse
plasma membrane.

999
00:59:53,505 --> 00:59:56,305
- It's like crystallized salt.
- Yes.

1000
00:59:56,307 --> 00:59:59,242
This organ is
definitely storing salt.

1001
00:59:59,244 --> 01:00:02,545
Which actually
would make a lot of sense

1002
01:00:02,547 --> 01:00:04,880
because the reverse plasma
membranes are probably

1003
01:00:04,882 --> 01:00:08,017
drawing in sodium from the ocean
in which it's living in.

1004
01:00:08,019 --> 01:00:09,485
It's being stored
in its glands

1005
01:00:09,487 --> 01:00:11,854
and it's rereleasing it
back into its system,

1006
01:00:11,856 --> 01:00:13,289
just like our body does
with insulin.

1007
01:00:13,291 --> 01:00:17,161
Kind of like camels
storing fat in its hump?

1008
01:00:17,163 --> 01:00:18,695
Right.
That's a good analogy.

1009
01:00:18,697 --> 01:00:21,063
This is good news
because if I can find a way

1010
01:00:21,065 --> 01:00:23,766
to actually destroy
these membranes,

1011
01:00:23,768 --> 01:00:25,702
it would be a much better
alternative than creating

1012
01:00:25,704 --> 01:00:27,970
a pathogen that would actually
pollute the environment

1013
01:00:27,972 --> 01:00:32,010
and run the risk of
hurting the population.

1014
01:00:33,478 --> 01:00:34,610
Excuse me.

1015
01:00:34,612 --> 01:00:35,912
This is <i>Intrepid Gull,</i>

1016
01:00:35,914 --> 01:00:37,380
closing in on
the new sonar activity.

1017
01:00:37,382 --> 01:00:40,784
Guys, I think there is
something else under here!

1018
01:00:40,786 --> 01:00:42,255
I'm outta here.

1019
01:00:43,554 --> 01:00:45,387
Come on, baby, come on.

1020
01:00:45,389 --> 01:00:46,491
Come on!

1021
01:00:53,331 --> 01:00:55,567
Come on, keep it going.
Keep it going.

1022
01:00:56,835 --> 01:00:59,137
Come on, let's go.

1023
01:01:00,271 --> 01:01:01,737
Ah!

1024
01:01:01,739 --> 01:01:04,740
The U.S.S. <i>Radiant</i> is
closing in on the location

1025
01:01:04,742 --> 01:01:08,711
the <i>Intrepid Gull</i> locked on
before it was destroyed.

1026
01:01:08,713 --> 01:01:11,481
The nuclear weapons are armed.

1027
01:01:11,483 --> 01:01:13,952
Maybe this could be
the way out.

1028
01:01:15,052 --> 01:01:16,989
You know what I think.

1029
01:01:26,831 --> 01:01:29,831
Atlantic Command, this is
Commanding Officer Sterling

1030
01:01:29,833 --> 01:01:31,568
of the U.S.S. <i>Radiant.</i>

1031
01:01:31,570 --> 01:01:33,639
You seeing these images?

1032
01:01:38,242 --> 01:01:39,742
<i>Atlantic Command.
Affirmative,</i> Radiant.

1033
01:01:39,744 --> 01:01:41,610
<i>You are clear
to sweep and destroy.</i>

1034
01:01:41,612 --> 01:01:44,014
<i>I say again, you're clear
to sweep and destroy.</i>

1035
01:01:44,016 --> 01:01:45,581
Copy that, Atlantic Command.

1036
01:01:45,583 --> 01:01:47,419
<i>Complying with orders
to sweep and destroy.</i>

1037
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:57,894
Forward torpedo room,
I need tubes one through four

1038
01:01:57,896 --> 01:02:01,463
ready to go with
MOD7 CBASS immediately.

1039
01:02:01,465 --> 01:02:04,536
<i>Copy, Command.
MOD7 CBASS, copy.</i>

1040
01:02:09,275 --> 01:02:11,510
Prepare for launch
on my mark.

1041
01:02:15,313 --> 01:02:18,216
And three... two...

1042
01:02:20,184 --> 01:02:21,653
one, mark!

1043
01:02:28,793 --> 01:02:30,392
Or not.

1044
01:02:30,394 --> 01:02:32,030
You gotta be kidding me.

1045
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:35,599
It was destroyed.

1046
01:02:35,601 --> 01:02:38,235
There's another
creature out there.

1047
01:02:38,237 --> 01:02:39,936
Creatures.

1048
01:02:39,938 --> 01:02:42,871
I need to know if Dr. Horowitz
has figured out a way

1049
01:02:42,873 --> 01:02:45,173
to destroy these things.

1050
01:02:45,175 --> 01:02:48,313
And I need those Armadas
right now!

1051
01:02:49,847 --> 01:02:51,150
Copy.

1052
01:03:02,661 --> 01:03:06,128
And that is
how we kill them.

1053
01:03:06,130 --> 01:03:08,197
The spiders are okay.

1054
01:03:08,199 --> 01:03:10,999
But what's the possibility we
have another larger creature?

1055
01:03:11,001 --> 01:03:13,670
Well, I mean, my assumption
is since the spiders came

1056
01:03:13,672 --> 01:03:15,505
from the larger creature
in the first place,

1057
01:03:15,507 --> 01:03:17,907
they probably share the same
genetic makeup and organs,

1058
01:03:17,909 --> 01:03:20,245
so I don't see
why they wouldn't.

1059
01:03:24,181 --> 01:03:26,048
The Armadas will be
the best option

1060
01:03:26,050 --> 01:03:27,583
for deploying this agent.

1061
01:03:27,585 --> 01:03:28,584
Do you agree?

1062
01:03:28,586 --> 01:03:30,354
Absolutely.

1063
01:03:30,356 --> 01:03:32,222
But how do we deploy this?

1064
01:03:32,224 --> 01:03:34,023
- The flame units.
- Hmm, brilliant.

1065
01:03:34,025 --> 01:03:35,358
I just have to tweak
them a bit.

1066
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:39,028
Okay.
Let's get on it ASAP.

1067
01:03:39,030 --> 01:03:41,831
Keep us apprised, Doctor.
We don't have much time.

1068
01:03:41,833 --> 01:03:43,735
No time, for that matter.

1069
01:03:47,539 --> 01:03:49,171
You sure this is gonna work?

1070
01:03:49,173 --> 01:03:50,775
It's all we've got.

1071
01:03:52,644 --> 01:03:54,280
Is that what
you're looking for?

1072
01:03:55,981 --> 01:03:56,979
Yeah.

1073
01:03:56,981 --> 01:03:58,248
We could use a bigger one...

1074
01:03:58,250 --> 01:04:00,483
22 or 24...
but it'll do for now.

1075
01:04:00,485 --> 01:04:01,487
Okay.

1076
01:04:04,657 --> 01:04:06,322
Hey...

1077
01:04:06,324 --> 01:04:10,293
Thank you for working with me.

1078
01:04:10,295 --> 01:04:12,061
I'm glad we got
to work together.

1079
01:04:12,063 --> 01:04:14,799
Even if it's the last day
we're alive.

1080
01:04:28,681 --> 01:04:30,012
Okay, Mr. Russo.

1081
01:04:30,014 --> 01:04:32,884
Let me know when you see
the igniter light go out.

1082
01:04:36,822 --> 01:04:38,487
All right, it's off!

1083
01:04:38,489 --> 01:04:41,258
Aerial and naval surveillance
have just confirmed

1084
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:42,825
two bogies moving toward shore.

1085
01:04:42,827 --> 01:04:43,959
Two?

1086
01:04:43,961 --> 01:04:45,364
Jesus!

1087
01:05:07,853 --> 01:05:09,351
Like a glove.

1088
01:05:10,856 --> 01:05:12,822
That should do it.
Locked and loaded!

1089
01:05:12,824 --> 01:05:14,958
<i>I suggest that
we keep one as a backup.</i>

1090
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,226
That sounds good to me.

1091
01:05:17,228 --> 01:05:19,929
Very well.

1092
01:05:19,931 --> 01:05:21,630
So is it ready?

1093
01:05:21,632 --> 01:05:24,066
As ready as it's gonna be.

1094
01:05:24,068 --> 01:05:25,635
Where's the pilots?

1095
01:05:25,637 --> 01:05:28,271
I can't stand this
waiting around stuff.

1096
01:05:28,273 --> 01:05:29,575
It drives me nuts.

1097
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:40,416
Bugs? Badger?

1098
01:05:40,418 --> 01:05:42,385
<i>Need you down
in the hangar ASAP!</i>

1099
01:05:42,387 --> 01:05:43,619
Finally!

1100
01:05:43,621 --> 01:05:46,791
Bugs, wake up.
It's time to go.

1101
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:52,595
Bugs, get your ass up!
It's time to go!

1102
01:05:52,597 --> 01:05:54,865
Bugs!

1103
01:05:54,867 --> 01:05:56,633
Bugs!
Oh my God!

1104
01:05:56,635 --> 01:05:58,034
Russo!

1105
01:05:58,036 --> 01:06:00,503
Bugs, Badger, I need you
down here ASAP, ASAP!

1106
01:06:00,505 --> 01:06:02,204
Russo, you need
to get down here!

1107
01:06:02,206 --> 01:06:03,572
There's something wrong
with Bugs!

1108
01:06:03,574 --> 01:06:06,511
I turned her around
and she's like...

1109
01:06:08,447 --> 01:06:10,347
What the hell?

1110
01:06:10,349 --> 01:06:12,985
Russo, why won't
the door open?

1111
01:06:19,657 --> 01:06:22,059
I am losing
good men right now!

1112
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:23,525
What the hell is going on?!

1113
01:06:23,527 --> 01:06:24,994
We have to quarantine them.

1114
01:06:24,996 --> 01:06:26,396
We're not letting them
out of there.

1115
01:06:26,398 --> 01:06:28,130
- She caught a contagion.
- All right.

1116
01:06:28,132 --> 01:06:29,499
If we don't have any pilots
to fly the Armadas,

1117
01:06:29,501 --> 01:06:31,166
how are we gonna
stop these things?

1118
01:06:31,168 --> 01:06:32,568
Wait.

1119
01:06:32,570 --> 01:06:34,204
Do you mean to
tell me, General,

1120
01:06:34,206 --> 01:06:35,505
that we don't have
any pilots left?

1121
01:06:35,507 --> 01:06:37,340
We do, but not
at this location.

1122
01:06:37,342 --> 01:06:39,075
I mean, this was
all so sudden.

1123
01:06:39,077 --> 01:06:40,677
We were
extremely unprepared.

1124
01:06:40,679 --> 01:06:42,311
It's gotta be me.

1125
01:06:42,313 --> 01:06:46,249
Doc, can anybody get
into those damn things?

1126
01:06:46,251 --> 01:06:47,516
Are you brain-mapped?

1127
01:06:47,518 --> 01:06:49,017
No. That is why I'm asking.

1128
01:06:49,019 --> 01:06:50,619
Yes, you do.

1129
01:06:50,621 --> 01:06:51,887
We can outfit you
with Bugs's rig,

1130
01:06:51,889 --> 01:06:54,458
but the lag time
will be even greater.

1131
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:56,358
Everyone's brain mapping
is slightly different

1132
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:59,195
and I have no idea how the
Armada's gonna work for you.

1133
01:06:59,197 --> 01:07:00,729
We have no other choice.

1134
01:07:00,731 --> 01:07:03,233
Put me in the damn thing.
Just put me in there.

1135
01:07:03,235 --> 01:07:04,833
I'll take the other one.

1136
01:07:04,835 --> 01:07:07,470
No. I need you to stay down
here and watch my back, okay?

1137
01:07:07,472 --> 01:07:09,371
No, I'm gonna pilot
the other Armada.

1138
01:07:09,373 --> 01:07:10,507
I cannot put you in
control of

1139
01:07:10,509 --> 01:07:12,642
a billion dollar
robot, Doctor.

1140
01:07:12,644 --> 01:07:17,079
General, the Armada's AI
works off of our brain impulse.

1141
01:07:17,081 --> 01:07:18,615
I'm already brain-mapped.

1142
01:07:18,617 --> 01:07:20,217
I have the least
amount of lag time.

1143
01:07:20,219 --> 01:07:21,517
No.

1144
01:07:21,519 --> 01:07:22,918
Quite frankly,
we have no other choice!

1145
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:25,320
We can't send
this man up alone.

1146
01:07:25,322 --> 01:07:27,826
No. Let someone else do it.

1147
01:07:30,195 --> 01:07:31,293
You worried about me,
Horowitz?

1148
01:07:31,295 --> 01:07:33,963
Maybe...

1149
01:07:33,965 --> 01:07:36,365
And it's Andrea.

1150
01:07:36,367 --> 01:07:38,003
J.P.

1151
01:07:39,771 --> 01:07:42,438
What's that stand for?

1152
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:44,941
If I come back alive,
I'll let you know.

1153
01:07:44,943 --> 01:07:47,809
Then come back alive.

1154
01:07:47,811 --> 01:07:49,080
Kill them.

1155
01:07:50,315 --> 01:07:52,949
- So you guys are ready?
- All set.

1156
01:07:52,951 --> 01:07:55,788
Let's go, let's go,
let's go! Let's suit up!

1157
01:08:56,414 --> 01:08:58,680
<i>Lee,
are you in position?</i>

1158
01:08:58,682 --> 01:09:01,349
Affirmative.
I have eyes on the target.

1159
01:09:01,351 --> 01:09:02,518
<i>Roger.
ETA two minutes.</i>

1160
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:03,952
Copy that.

1161
01:09:03,954 --> 01:09:05,521
<i>Make sure
the targets are tagged</i>

1162
01:09:05,523 --> 01:09:07,159
<i>before we get there.</i>

1163
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:13,830
Russo, change your
L sat to 070328!

1164
01:09:13,832 --> 01:09:16,900
<i>Standing by
for activation.</i>

1165
01:09:16,902 --> 01:09:19,738
<i>Got it.
Signal loud and clear.</i>

1166
01:09:20,905 --> 01:09:22,839
This should make it easier

1167
01:09:22,841 --> 01:09:23,839
<i>for the missiles
to hit the target.</i>

1168
01:09:23,841 --> 01:09:25,743
<i>Go get 'em, Russo.</i>

1169
01:09:29,247 --> 01:09:31,615
<i>Doc, make sure
you stay behind me!</i>

1170
01:09:31,617 --> 01:09:33,450
<i>I'll take the brunt
of all the attacks!</i>

1171
01:09:33,452 --> 01:09:35,285
<i>When I give the word,
you go ahead</i>

1172
01:09:35,287 --> 01:09:37,152
<i>and deploy the aerosol attack!
You got that?</i>

1173
01:09:37,154 --> 01:09:38,756
<i>Will do.</i>

1174
01:09:43,328 --> 01:09:46,228
<i>Are you seeing what
we're seeing down here?</i>

1175
01:09:46,230 --> 01:09:48,764
<i>Wow! What the hell
are they doing?</i>

1176
01:09:48,766 --> 01:09:49,833
<i>All the spiders
are attaching themselves</i>

1177
01:09:49,835 --> 01:09:51,500
<i>to a larger creature.</i>

1178
01:09:51,502 --> 01:09:53,568
<i>All right now,
stay back. Don't get eager.</i>

1179
01:09:53,570 --> 01:09:56,175
<i>Let me take the pass first,
and we'll see how they react.</i>

1180
01:10:00,311 --> 01:10:01,777
<i>Russo. watch out!</i>

1181
01:10:01,779 --> 01:10:03,549
<i>The big one is
going for you!</i>

1182
01:10:13,425 --> 01:10:15,458
I'm coming in, Russo!

1183
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:17,095
<i>Negative! Stay back!</i>

1184
01:10:25,369 --> 01:10:27,403
<i>Mr. Russo, you've
got a lot of spiders</i>

1185
01:10:27,405 --> 01:10:28,704
<i>headed your way!</i>

1186
01:10:28,706 --> 01:10:30,106
Yeah. Yeah, I know, Doc.

1187
01:10:30,108 --> 01:10:34,546
But this damn AI,
serious lag, serious lag.

1188
01:10:45,957 --> 01:10:48,227
God, it's like moving
through mud!

1189
01:10:55,265 --> 01:10:56,268
Just say the word!

1190
01:11:01,372 --> 01:11:03,304
<i>Now! Deploy it now!</i>

1191
01:11:03,306 --> 01:11:05,810
Okay, I'm there!

1192
01:11:10,715 --> 01:11:14,250
What? What?
It's not working!

1193
01:11:14,252 --> 01:11:16,486
<i>Doc, you're clear
to use the flamethrower!</i>

1194
01:11:16,488 --> 01:11:18,720
<i>Use the damn flamethrower!</i>

1195
01:11:18,722 --> 01:11:20,024
It's not working!

1196
01:11:22,961 --> 01:11:24,930
The flamethrower's down!

1197
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:32,203
<i>Doc, move!</i>

1198
01:11:33,471 --> 01:11:35,206
Oh!

1199
01:11:41,345 --> 01:11:42,547
Ah!

1200
01:11:49,420 --> 01:11:50,753
Thank you.

1201
01:11:50,755 --> 01:11:52,287
<i>Have you figured out</i>

1202
01:11:52,289 --> 01:11:53,690
<i>what's wrong with
the weapon system yet?</i>

1203
01:11:53,692 --> 01:11:54,857
No.

1204
01:11:54,859 --> 01:11:56,526
No, it's still down!

1205
01:11:56,528 --> 01:11:57,927
<i>Well, you gotta
stay clear</i>

1206
01:11:57,929 --> 01:11:59,297
<i>until you figure out
how to fix it!</i>

1207
01:12:01,099 --> 01:12:02,900
Agh!

1208
01:12:04,269 --> 01:12:05,304
Damn it!

1209
01:12:15,747 --> 01:12:18,650
All right, I am low on ammo.
I am low on ammo.

1210
01:12:21,886 --> 01:12:23,718
Fall back while using
the rockets.

1211
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:24,887
Stay at a safe distance.

1212
01:12:24,889 --> 01:12:26,321
I repeat,
stay at a safe distance!

1213
01:12:26,323 --> 01:12:27,322
Copy that?

1214
01:12:27,324 --> 01:12:28,659
<i>Gotcha.</i>

1215
01:12:37,068 --> 01:12:39,271
Come on, let's go!
Come on!

1216
01:12:47,545 --> 01:12:49,512
Yeah! Come on!

1217
01:12:49,514 --> 01:12:51,013
Let's go!

1218
01:12:51,015 --> 01:12:54,083
<i>How are we going
on the flamethrower, Doc?</i>

1219
01:12:54,085 --> 01:12:55,951
<i>Nothing is working.</i>

1220
01:12:55,953 --> 01:12:57,352
<i>I don't know if it's
going to happen.</i>

1221
01:12:57,354 --> 01:12:59,955
Fix that damn flamethrower!
Put it online!

1222
01:12:59,957 --> 01:13:01,659
We gotta get that
damn thing online!

1223
01:13:10,335 --> 01:13:13,635
Oh, for... Please tell me
you're seeing this.

1224
01:13:13,637 --> 01:13:14,872
Yes.

1225
01:13:17,207 --> 01:13:20,211
Giant Killer, are you
getting this feed?

1226
01:13:22,747 --> 01:13:25,246
Yes, Mr. Russo!
We see it!

1227
01:13:25,248 --> 01:13:28,219
It looks like they're
killing each other.

1228
01:13:33,690 --> 01:13:35,260
What the hell is it?

1229
01:13:38,429 --> 01:13:40,429
Roth, what you thinking?

1230
01:13:40,431 --> 01:13:43,034
I have no idea.

1231
01:13:47,505 --> 01:13:48,771
It's recombining.

1232
01:13:48,773 --> 01:13:50,406
What the hell
does that mean?

1233
01:13:50,408 --> 01:13:53,808
It's got
recombinant proteins.

1234
01:13:53,810 --> 01:13:55,313
It's becoming one organism.

1235
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:00,819
I think you're right.

1236
01:14:07,992 --> 01:14:10,293
<i>Dr. Roth, get back!</i>

1237
01:14:10,295 --> 01:14:11,229
<i>Get back!</i>

1238
01:14:23,073 --> 01:14:24,706
<i>Doc, I need you to stay
as far back from this thing</i>

1239
01:14:24,708 --> 01:14:26,909
<i>as possible until you
figure out what the hell</i>

1240
01:14:26,911 --> 01:14:28,577
<i>is going on with
that weapons system!</i>

1241
01:14:28,579 --> 01:14:30,044
<i>You copy that?</i>

1242
01:14:30,046 --> 01:14:31,449
<i>Yeah, yeah,
I do, Mr. Russo.</i>

1243
01:14:33,951 --> 01:14:36,152
Dr. Roth, have you
figured another way

1244
01:14:36,154 --> 01:14:37,687
to release
the pathogens yet?

1245
01:14:37,689 --> 01:14:39,925
No, not yet.

1246
01:14:42,761 --> 01:14:44,793
Give me the backup canister.
I'm going out there.

1247
01:14:44,795 --> 01:14:46,262
No, no, no, no, no.

1248
01:14:46,264 --> 01:14:47,528
You're not
going out there alone.

1249
01:14:47,530 --> 01:14:49,464
That's suicide.

1250
01:14:49,466 --> 01:14:50,801
I'm going.

1251
01:14:52,269 --> 01:14:54,370
All right, I'll go with you.
I'll escort you.

1252
01:14:54,372 --> 01:14:56,673
I'll keep you safe.
You're getting back.

1253
01:14:56,675 --> 01:14:58,107
Okay?

1254
01:14:58,109 --> 01:15:00,710
Protect her, Lee.
She's our last resort.

1255
01:15:00,712 --> 01:15:02,077
Yes, sir.

1256
01:15:02,079 --> 01:15:03,280
Come on.

1257
01:15:21,533 --> 01:15:23,135
Move!

1258
01:16:02,739 --> 01:16:05,741
My leg! It's burning through!

1259
01:16:05,743 --> 01:16:07,309
It's burning through the suit.

1260
01:16:07,311 --> 01:16:09,146
Please tell me you
got it online!

1261
01:16:13,752 --> 01:16:15,250
Tell me you got
the weapons back online.

1262
01:16:15,252 --> 01:16:17,253
Tell me you got the weapons
back online.

1263
01:16:17,255 --> 01:16:20,455
Negative,
but I have an idea!

1264
01:16:20,457 --> 01:16:22,224
I'm gonna jam this
flamethrower's arm

1265
01:16:22,226 --> 01:16:24,360
down this thing's neck.

1266
01:16:24,362 --> 01:16:28,062
The acid should eat its
way through the fuselage

1267
01:16:28,064 --> 01:16:29,999
and release the aerosol.

1268
01:16:33,604 --> 01:16:36,972
That's crazy, Roth.
That's crazy.

1269
01:16:36,974 --> 01:16:39,141
All right.

1270
01:16:39,143 --> 01:16:40,976
I got it, I got it,
I got an idea.

1271
01:16:40,978 --> 01:16:42,510
<i>Hold up, guys!</i>

1272
01:16:42,512 --> 01:16:44,780
<i>No need for the backup
canister just yet.</i>

1273
01:16:44,782 --> 01:16:46,848
<i>Let me try this first.</i>

1274
01:16:46,850 --> 01:16:48,217
Roth, are you sure?

1275
01:16:48,219 --> 01:16:49,250
I don't like this.

1276
01:16:49,252 --> 01:16:50,686
This thing is way too strong.

1277
01:16:50,688 --> 01:16:52,388
You might want to consider
weakening it first.

1278
01:16:52,390 --> 01:16:54,123
<i>And how do you
suggest we do this?</i>

1279
01:16:54,125 --> 01:16:55,424
<i>Missiles aren't
exactly accomplishing that,</i>

1280
01:16:55,426 --> 01:16:57,160
<i>and I don't know
what will.</i>

1281
01:16:57,162 --> 01:16:58,494
<i>I know what
will do it,</i>

1282
01:16:58,496 --> 01:17:00,228
<i>just gotta be direct
and precise.</i>

1283
01:17:00,230 --> 01:17:01,664
<i>Russo,
I don't like that tone.</i>

1284
01:17:01,666 --> 01:17:03,465
<i>That's what you
said in Tripoli, man.</i>

1285
01:17:06,871 --> 01:17:08,537
- What is it?
- Karen.

1286
01:17:08,539 --> 01:17:09,705
Your wife?

1287
01:17:09,707 --> 01:17:11,240
Yeah, looks like
she's in a building

1288
01:17:11,242 --> 01:17:12,241
half a mile away from here.

1289
01:17:12,243 --> 01:17:13,942
Let's go get her.

1290
01:17:13,944 --> 01:17:15,811
<i>No, we need to be
Roth and Russo's backup.</i>

1291
01:17:15,813 --> 01:17:19,117
<i>Lee, we got this.
Go get your wife and daughter.</i>

1292
01:17:29,993 --> 01:17:32,527
Here's what
we gotta do first.

1293
01:17:32,529 --> 01:17:35,563
I'm gonna ram into
that son of a bitch,

1294
01:17:35,565 --> 01:17:37,532
and then you gotta
finish the job.

1295
01:17:37,534 --> 01:17:39,335
That's not necessary, Russo.

1296
01:17:39,337 --> 01:17:41,035
Just hang in there.
I'm coming in!

1297
01:17:41,037 --> 01:17:42,571
Shut up!

1298
01:17:42,573 --> 01:17:44,175
Just do what the hell
I'm telling you!

1299
01:17:46,810 --> 01:17:50,345
Go on my signal,
on my signal.

1300
01:17:50,347 --> 01:17:51,315
Ready?

1301
01:17:57,253 --> 01:17:59,490
Okay.
Here we go.

1302
01:18:00,692 --> 01:18:02,223
Russo, no!

1303
01:18:02,225 --> 01:18:04,727
That's all you got? Huh?

1304
01:18:04,729 --> 01:18:05,963
Two...

1305
01:18:16,740 --> 01:18:18,143
No!

1306
01:18:22,012 --> 01:18:23,545
What was that?

1307
01:18:23,547 --> 01:18:25,416
Shh, shh, shh.

1308
01:18:26,551 --> 01:18:27,983
I love you, sweetheart.

1309
01:18:27,985 --> 01:18:30,020
I love you, too.

1310
01:18:36,027 --> 01:18:37,893
Karen?

1311
01:18:37,895 --> 01:18:40,432
Dad!
I knew you'd come!

1312
01:18:42,399 --> 01:18:43,965
Alex.

1313
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:46,403
I knew you'd come.

1314
01:18:48,439 --> 01:18:49,737
Is it over?

1315
01:18:49,739 --> 01:18:51,072
Yeah.

1316
01:18:51,074 --> 01:18:53,577
I have a car outside.
Let's go home.

1317
01:19:02,386 --> 01:19:04,722
<i>Okay, I'm gonna ram
this down its throat.</i>

1318
01:19:12,430 --> 01:19:15,233
Come on, baby!
Use your acid.

1319
01:19:25,009 --> 01:19:27,412
All right, come to mama!

1320
01:19:41,359 --> 01:19:43,495
Ugh!

1321
01:20:04,782 --> 01:20:06,214
Are they both okay?

1322
01:20:06,216 --> 01:20:08,584
Safe and sound.
Thank you for that, Doctor.

1323
01:20:08,586 --> 01:20:10,119
Okay, now we need
to get to Roth

1324
01:20:10,121 --> 01:20:11,655
before the acid eats
through his cockpit.

1325
01:20:13,157 --> 01:20:15,427
Hang on, Doc.
This could get squirrely.

1326
01:20:17,194 --> 01:20:19,130
Here, take a right.

1327
01:20:30,541 --> 01:20:33,378
Doc, get Roth.
I'll cover you from here.

1328
01:20:46,024 --> 01:20:47,755
Dr. Roth?

1329
01:20:47,757 --> 01:20:48,891
Dr. Roth?

1330
01:20:48,893 --> 01:20:50,360
Dr. Roth?
Can you hear me?

1331
01:20:54,765 --> 01:20:57,031
Dr. Roth?

1332
01:20:57,033 --> 01:20:59,567
Dr. Roth,
can you hear me?

1333
01:20:59,569 --> 01:21:00,803
Oh, fuck.

1334
01:21:05,141 --> 01:21:07,108
Dr. Roth,
can you hear me?

1335
01:21:07,110 --> 01:21:08,477
Can you...

1336
01:21:08,479 --> 01:21:11,046
Hey, it's me.
It's Andrea.

1337
01:21:11,048 --> 01:21:12,880
What happened?

1338
01:21:12,882 --> 01:21:16,818
You killed them.
That's what happened.

1339
01:21:16,820 --> 01:21:18,555
You're a hero.

1340
01:21:20,324 --> 01:21:21,824
We got to get you
out of here, okay?

1341
01:21:21,826 --> 01:21:24,695
Okay, come on.
Come on.

1342
01:21:30,833 --> 01:21:33,568
You're okay.

1343
01:21:33,570 --> 01:21:36,537
Come on, we gotta go quick.
Come on.

1344
01:21:36,539 --> 01:21:37,609
Come on.

1345
01:21:39,944 --> 01:21:42,380
Let's go, let's go.

1346
01:22:15,378 --> 01:22:17,144
James Patrick.

1347
01:22:17,146 --> 01:22:18,146
What?

1348
01:22:18,148 --> 01:22:19,682
That's my name.

1349
01:22:19,684 --> 01:22:22,918
I told you I'd tell you
if I made it out alive.

1350
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:26,787
Well, James,
I'm glad you're not dead.

1351
01:22:26,789 --> 01:22:27,926
Me, too.

1352
01:22:37,337 --> 01:22:42,337
