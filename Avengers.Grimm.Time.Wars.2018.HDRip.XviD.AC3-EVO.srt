1
00:00:01,296 --> 00:00:04,388
<i>What if I told you
fairy tales are real?</i>

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:08,301
<i>Imagine, endless realms
of terrible wonders.</i>

3
00:00:08,303 --> 00:00:11,678
<i>Each and every reality
beyond our own is linked,</i>

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,127
<i>a vast multiverse
of grim forces</i>

5
00:00:14,129 --> 00:00:16,386
<i>and sinister reflections.</i>

6
00:00:16,388 --> 00:00:18,739
<i>Only the
thinnest barrier separates us</i>

7
00:00:18,741 --> 00:00:20,340
<i>from all of the magic.</i>

8
00:00:20,342 --> 00:00:22,043
<i>All the monsters.</i>

9
00:00:22,045 --> 00:00:26,447
<i>Now imagine, once upon a time,
that barrier broke.</i>

10
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:30,351
<i>And when it did, all manner
of wicked fairy tale types</i>

11
00:00:30,353 --> 00:00:33,054
<i>found a way from
their world to ours.</i>

12
00:00:33,056 --> 00:00:35,257
<i>That was until
the princesses arrived</i>

13
00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:37,591
<i>and showed us that
magic is real,</i>

14
00:00:37,593 --> 00:00:39,493
<i>and a real threat.</i>

15
00:00:39,495 --> 00:00:42,230
<i>So I founded Looking Glass,</i>

16
00:00:42,232 --> 00:00:44,099
<i>and when death reared its</i>

17
00:00:44,101 --> 00:00:47,068
<i>ugly head once more,
at least I was prepared.</i>

18
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,837
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

19
00:00:48,839 --> 00:00:51,306
<i>Now it's Looking Glass
that protects the world</i>

20
00:00:51,308 --> 00:00:53,874
<i>from any future
fairy tale threats,</i>

21
00:00:53,876 --> 00:00:56,310
<i>though I fear,
with what I know,</i>

22
00:00:56,312 --> 00:01:00,251
<i>that this time
I may need a little more help.</i>

23
00:01:23,607 --> 00:01:25,510
Hey, guy.

24
00:01:27,345 --> 00:01:29,109
You okay?

25
00:01:46,162 --> 00:01:48,031
She's beautiful.

26
00:01:49,566 --> 00:01:51,498
Run!

27
00:02:40,517 --> 00:02:42,484
I suppose it will do.

28
00:02:42,486 --> 00:02:46,654
Looks like Prince Charming
has gotten cold feet.

29
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,623
Take the city! Find him!

30
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:51,425
Bring back my ring!

31
00:02:51,427 --> 00:02:53,897
For the glory of Atlantis!

32
00:02:59,837 --> 00:03:02,072
I've got a wedding to plan.

33
00:03:04,636 --> 00:03:09,636
Subtitles by explosiveskull

34
00:03:12,548 --> 00:03:15,651
Tsk, tsk, such poor guests!

35
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,985
Of course, the squad's
away on holiday

36
00:03:17,987 --> 00:03:21,423
when the bloody Sea People
start destroying my city.

37
00:03:21,425 --> 00:03:23,224
Hatter!

38
00:03:23,226 --> 00:03:26,260
Hatter!

39
00:03:26,262 --> 00:03:27,528
Present.

40
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,497
Tell me we recognize our

41
00:03:29,499 --> 00:03:31,265
new oceanic oppressors.

42
00:03:31,267 --> 00:03:34,670
Uh, Princess Magdalena
of Atlantis

43
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:37,505
or "Magda the Mad."

44
00:03:37,507 --> 00:03:39,007
Splendid.

45
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:40,741
I like her already.

46
00:03:40,743 --> 00:03:42,379
And the handsome fellow?

47
00:03:47,683 --> 00:03:50,718
Charles Charming III,
a Prince.

48
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,754
Of course.

49
00:03:52,756 --> 00:03:57,391
Legendary hero, if
I remember correctly.

50
00:03:57,393 --> 00:03:59,660
He was all set to be wed.

51
00:03:59,662 --> 00:04:01,496
And then just up
and disappeared.

52
00:04:01,498 --> 00:04:05,533
No doubt out to sea with
our little mermaid here.

53
00:04:05,535 --> 00:04:07,603
Why is it always
a lover's quarrel

54
00:04:07,605 --> 00:04:10,771
with these fairy tale types?

55
00:04:10,773 --> 00:04:14,074
Well, that is not
the whole tale told.

56
00:04:14,076 --> 00:04:17,148
Wait until you see
his bride-to-be.

57
00:04:26,422 --> 00:04:29,025
Curiouser and curiouser.

58
00:04:36,732 --> 00:04:39,002
I think it's time
we break the ice.

59
00:04:48,045 --> 00:04:51,280
I'm supposed to be sending
these out of towners back home.

60
00:04:51,282 --> 00:04:54,817
But we're about
to let this one out.

61
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:56,851
The last time she went
mucking about,

62
00:04:56,853 --> 00:05:00,389
she nearly destroyed
the whole of reality.

63
00:05:00,391 --> 00:05:03,427
Well, desperate times,
I suppose.

64
00:05:32,922 --> 00:05:34,588
- Hatter?
- Yes?

65
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:37,024
If you would be so kind as to
prepare a batch of my medicine?

66
00:05:37,026 --> 00:05:39,961
- Yes.
- I fear I'll require it soon.

67
00:05:39,963 --> 00:05:41,795
Regular or extra strength?

68
00:05:41,797 --> 00:05:44,398
Both.

69
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,502
Now, Hatter!

70
00:05:47,437 --> 00:05:49,605
Snow White, I presume?

71
00:05:49,607 --> 00:05:53,042
I think it's time we had
a chat about your fiancé.

72
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:14,295
Magda, baby!

73
00:06:14,297 --> 00:06:15,829
Kill him.

74
00:06:15,831 --> 00:06:18,399
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold your
sea horses there, fish sticks!

75
00:06:18,401 --> 00:06:22,906
You kill me, how are you
gonna find your hubby?

76
00:06:24,206 --> 00:06:26,208
I have the city surrounded.

77
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:31,312
My Mermen searching
block by block.

78
00:06:31,314 --> 00:06:32,781
I'll find him.

79
00:06:32,783 --> 00:06:37,050
Maybe, but I hate
to break it to you, sister.

80
00:06:37,052 --> 00:06:39,887
You're not the only
game in town.

81
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:41,557
Charming's got options.

82
00:06:41,559 --> 00:06:45,560
Sure, you might
find him eventually.

83
00:06:45,562 --> 00:06:48,930
But someone else might
find him first.

84
00:06:48,932 --> 00:06:52,169
Like Snow White.

85
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:56,271
What about her?

86
00:06:56,273 --> 00:06:59,876
She's in town
and she's not alone.

87
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:04,245
And you know this how?

88
00:07:04,247 --> 00:07:06,982
Identify yourself, stranger!

89
00:07:06,984 --> 00:07:10,918
Pardon me, your highness.

90
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,355
Forgot my Ps and Qs.

91
00:07:13,357 --> 00:07:15,790
It's been a while since
I've made a proper interaction

92
00:07:15,792 --> 00:07:19,093
with real royalty.

93
00:07:19,095 --> 00:07:22,129
Name's Rumpelstiltskin.

94
00:07:22,131 --> 00:07:26,033
It's my job
to know these things.

95
00:07:26,035 --> 00:07:29,036
I don't have my resume on me.

96
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:32,206
But my last gig was
Ruler of the Underworld.

97
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:34,675
That got boring real fast.

98
00:07:34,677 --> 00:07:37,411
Turns out the dead,
they just love to talk.

99
00:07:37,413 --> 00:07:40,514
"It's not my time!
Not yet!"

100
00:07:42,052 --> 00:07:43,951
Then I started seeing
those BBQed people

101
00:07:43,953 --> 00:07:45,586
that you were sending down.

102
00:07:45,588 --> 00:07:49,990
And I thought, wow,
I have to see her for myself.

103
00:07:49,992 --> 00:07:52,793
Rumpelstiltskin.

104
00:07:52,795 --> 00:07:54,261
I've heard of you.

105
00:07:54,263 --> 00:07:57,031
Ah, so.
You know my work?

106
00:07:57,033 --> 00:08:00,668
I heard you killed Snow White.

107
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,870
Or that she killed you.

108
00:08:02,872 --> 00:08:04,305
Yes.

109
00:08:04,307 --> 00:08:06,374
Different Rumpelstiltskin.

110
00:08:06,376 --> 00:08:09,209
It's a popular name
where I come from.

111
00:08:09,211 --> 00:08:11,913
The enemy of my enemy.

112
00:08:11,915 --> 00:08:15,584
Sure, yes.
Let's go with that.

113
00:08:15,586 --> 00:08:17,351
All right.

114
00:08:17,353 --> 00:08:21,622
If you're such a businessman,
what is it you are offering?

115
00:08:21,624 --> 00:08:23,156
And what will it cost me?

116
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:25,526
Not only will I bring
Prince Charming to you

117
00:08:25,528 --> 00:08:27,694
and lay him at your
flippered feet,

118
00:08:27,696 --> 00:08:30,598
but I'll convince him
to tie the knot, too.

119
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,233
Hmm.

120
00:08:32,235 --> 00:08:34,034
Well, that's how
it works, isn't it?

121
00:08:34,036 --> 00:08:37,673
He has to marry you?

122
00:08:37,675 --> 00:08:39,474
Yes.

123
00:08:39,476 --> 00:08:42,777
According to my knowledge of
the Enchantment, all I need

124
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:47,981
is for him willingly place
the ring on my finger.

125
00:08:47,983 --> 00:08:49,984
Well, that's doable.

126
00:08:49,986 --> 00:08:51,318
And while I'm at it,

127
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,187
maybe I'll even take care
of Snow White.

128
00:08:53,189 --> 00:08:58,826
All for the low,
low price of Atlantis.

129
00:09:00,296 --> 00:09:02,431
I changed my mind.

130
00:09:02,433 --> 00:09:03,731
Kill him!

131
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:05,499
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Now listen here.

132
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:08,036
Hey, if I can spin
straw into gold,

133
00:09:08,038 --> 00:09:10,705
surely I can get you hitched.

134
00:09:10,707 --> 00:09:14,609
Plus, what do you need
Atlantis for anyway, huh?

135
00:09:14,611 --> 00:09:17,878
Once you're leader of
all the land,

136
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,216
you'll be fine once we get
that ring on your finger.

137
00:09:22,218 --> 00:09:23,884
Fair point.

138
00:09:23,886 --> 00:09:25,687
I'll discuss terms

139
00:09:25,689 --> 00:09:29,624
once Charles is
returned to me.

140
00:09:29,626 --> 00:09:32,793
First, I'll need
a show of good faith.

141
00:09:32,795 --> 00:09:35,062
How do you expect to

142
00:09:35,064 --> 00:09:39,299
"lay him at my
flippered feet", was it?

143
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:42,070
That's the easy part.

144
00:09:42,072 --> 00:09:45,173
You see, these valiant
heroic types,

145
00:09:45,175 --> 00:09:47,174
the more honorable they are,

146
00:09:47,176 --> 00:09:50,812
the easier it is
to manipulate.

147
00:09:50,814 --> 00:09:55,718
And I know a surefire way to
get any hero to come running.

148
00:10:08,897 --> 00:10:11,067
Magda.

149
00:11:28,277 --> 00:11:30,945
Charles?

150
00:11:30,947 --> 00:11:34,115
Oh, I thought he was dead.

151
00:11:34,117 --> 00:11:36,149
He disappeared so long ago.

152
00:11:36,151 --> 00:11:37,317
Where was he?

153
00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:39,821
Atlantis, as it were.

154
00:11:39,823 --> 00:11:41,455
Magda!

155
00:11:41,457 --> 00:11:44,892
You know her, then?

156
00:11:44,894 --> 00:11:46,860
From before all of this.

157
00:11:46,862 --> 00:11:48,763
But what's she doing here?

158
00:11:48,765 --> 00:11:51,566
Well, you may have
saved the city once before

159
00:11:51,568 --> 00:11:55,937
but you certainly made a proper
mess of things in the process.

160
00:11:57,439 --> 00:12:01,008
So far as I can tell,
when your mirror broke,

161
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:02,743
reality broke with it.

162
00:12:02,745 --> 00:12:06,014
What was once a path to
a seemingly infinite number

163
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:08,515
of realms is all
messed up now.

164
00:12:08,517 --> 00:12:10,150
Now there are bits and
fragments of

165
00:12:10,152 --> 00:12:15,023
this mirror scattered all
over the bloody world, my world.

166
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:19,894
And each one is a gateway to
a different fairy tale realm,

167
00:12:19,896 --> 00:12:21,863
including yours.

168
00:12:21,865 --> 00:12:23,999
Should have known one
would have popped up

169
00:12:24,001 --> 00:12:25,903
in the middle of the ocean.

170
00:12:26,935 --> 00:12:28,436
This one is Neverland.

171
00:12:28,438 --> 00:12:30,171
Quite fond of it myself.

172
00:12:30,173 --> 00:12:31,371
Here, you'd never grow old.

173
00:12:31,373 --> 00:12:33,207
It's wonderful for the skin,

174
00:12:33,209 --> 00:12:35,208
if you can stomach the pirates.

175
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:36,677
And that one?

176
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:40,248
It's got flying monkeys,
of all absurdities.

177
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,683
And for each one apart
from its place,

178
00:12:42,685 --> 00:12:47,321
it's me who puts them back,
including Magda.

179
00:12:47,323 --> 00:12:52,693
Including you,
if I'm to be honest.

180
00:12:52,695 --> 00:12:57,164
What does she want
and why is she here?

181
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,999
What she's always wanted:

182
00:12:59,001 --> 00:13:00,835
To rule.

183
00:13:00,837 --> 00:13:03,102
One might think
the ocean would suffice

184
00:13:03,104 --> 00:13:04,538
for a girl with gills.

185
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,240
She wants the surface.

186
00:13:06,242 --> 00:13:10,845
She needs Charles
to get it, his ring.

187
00:13:10,847 --> 00:13:15,582
Whoever he marries
rules all the land.

188
00:13:15,584 --> 00:13:17,585
So literal, you bunch.

189
00:13:17,587 --> 00:13:22,456
Well, then, off we pop
to rescue the Prince,

190
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:25,360
stomp the evil sea people,
and send you packing.

191
00:13:25,362 --> 00:13:27,394
Forgive the rather
rushed revival

192
00:13:27,396 --> 00:13:28,929
but we're woefully
tight on time.

193
00:13:28,931 --> 00:13:33,269
But I'll show you where to find
Sleeping Beauty and Red.

194
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,815
Oh!

195
00:13:47,817 --> 00:13:49,519
Nighty-night.

196
00:13:54,891 --> 00:13:56,593
Heh!

197
00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:06,167
Sloppy and
stupid, Princess.

198
00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:07,768
Thanks, Red.

199
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:12,609
Here, for when
the magic doesn't work.

200
00:14:14,944 --> 00:14:17,043
Seems like they were
looking for something?

201
00:14:17,045 --> 00:14:18,613
Or someone.

202
00:14:18,615 --> 00:14:20,514
I wonder who got
all these guys?

203
00:14:20,516 --> 00:14:22,015
Maybe Looking Glass?

204
00:14:22,017 --> 00:14:25,086
There's plenty
to go around, Sleepy.

205
00:14:25,088 --> 00:14:28,855
Kind of reminds me
of the good old days.

206
00:14:28,857 --> 00:14:32,527
Nice to see some
familiar faces!

207
00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:34,628
Looks like
you've been keeping busy.

208
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:37,597
Snow White?
I thought you were dead.

209
00:14:37,599 --> 00:14:41,034
Just been on ice
for a little while.

210
00:14:41,036 --> 00:14:42,669
Where are the others?

211
00:14:42,671 --> 00:14:44,038
Well, if you haven't noticed,

212
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,005
there's been a lot of
heat around here lately.

213
00:14:46,007 --> 00:14:48,274
Looking Glass has been
rounding people like us

214
00:14:48,276 --> 00:14:49,943
and sending them
who knows where.

215
00:14:49,945 --> 00:14:51,446
And now that
there's a whole army of

216
00:14:51,448 --> 00:14:53,214
Atlanteans attacking the city,

217
00:14:53,216 --> 00:14:54,682
they're nowhere to be found.

218
00:14:54,684 --> 00:14:58,318
Well, that's why I'm here.
We have a mission.

219
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,788
- Finally!
- Oh, joy.

220
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,523
But you're not
gonna like it.

221
00:15:02,525 --> 00:15:04,291
Do I ever?

222
00:15:04,293 --> 00:15:06,827
How did you find us?

223
00:15:06,829 --> 00:15:10,197
The mirror...
or what's left of it.

224
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:12,398
Then that means...

225
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,567
Oh, you're kidding.

226
00:15:13,569 --> 00:15:14,934
Looking Glass.

227
00:15:14,936 --> 00:15:17,039
- Nice.
- Let's go ask Alice.

228
00:15:21,477 --> 00:15:24,879
So, let me get this straight.

229
00:15:24,881 --> 00:15:29,984
This whole entire time, you've
been here literally chilling

230
00:15:29,986 --> 00:15:34,422
and just, you've slept through
an entire enemy invasion!

231
00:15:34,424 --> 00:15:36,691
It wasn't exactly my choice.

232
00:15:36,693 --> 00:15:39,293
If someone would have
defrosted me sooner!

233
00:15:39,295 --> 00:15:41,095
Oh, please!

234
00:15:41,097 --> 00:15:43,431
Every time you royal types
go stomping around,

235
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:46,667
it's us little people
you step all over.

236
00:15:46,669 --> 00:15:48,001
Well, that's enough!

237
00:15:48,003 --> 00:15:50,537
Like it or not,
it's up to us to stop Magda.

238
00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:52,572
She only wants one thing.

239
00:15:52,574 --> 00:15:54,975
And she won't stop
until she gets him.

240
00:15:54,977 --> 00:15:58,044
So it's up to us
to find Charles first.

241
00:15:58,046 --> 00:16:00,114
Charles?

242
00:16:00,116 --> 00:16:02,582
Charming?
Prince Charming?

243
00:16:02,584 --> 00:16:05,186
Didn't you two have
a little...

244
00:16:05,188 --> 00:16:06,687
That doesn't matter right now.

245
00:16:06,689 --> 00:16:09,288
What matters is if
Magda marries Charles,

246
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:12,726
she could put the whole city
underwater if she wants.

247
00:16:12,728 --> 00:16:16,165
Who would put that much
power in a wedding ring?

248
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,267
Charles is noble, valiant.

249
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:22,068
Every bit the hero.

250
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,770
He never wanted to rule.

251
00:16:23,772 --> 00:16:26,474
That's what the people wanted.

252
00:16:26,476 --> 00:16:27,975
And they gave him that power.

253
00:16:27,977 --> 00:16:31,512
Power over all the land
in the form of a ring.

254
00:16:31,514 --> 00:16:34,782
And he wanted
to share it with me.

255
00:16:34,784 --> 00:16:36,517
"Fairest in all the land."

256
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:39,320
I get it!

257
00:16:42,257 --> 00:16:44,524
All right! All right!

258
00:16:44,526 --> 00:16:47,628
Let's all go back
and get your man!

259
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,230
How do we find him?

260
00:16:51,266 --> 00:16:53,267
Well, that's a spot of luck.

261
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:55,503
The alley by the church!

262
00:16:55,505 --> 00:16:57,140
Damn, Snow beats.

263
00:17:01,077 --> 00:17:02,744
Shall I continue?

264
00:17:02,746 --> 00:17:04,511
Oh, I think
that will do fine.

265
00:17:04,513 --> 00:17:07,515
If I were the hero type,
I'd come running.

266
00:17:07,517 --> 00:17:08,982
So what next then?

267
00:17:08,984 --> 00:17:11,519
Kill hostages, destroy cities?

268
00:17:11,521 --> 00:17:14,821
Threaten... threaten
to kill hostages.

269
00:17:14,823 --> 00:17:17,124
Threaten to destroy cities.

270
00:17:17,126 --> 00:17:21,128
If you kill anyone,
you have no leverage.

271
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,196
Hmm.

272
00:17:22,198 --> 00:17:24,198
I see.

273
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,932
Well, maybe just one then.

274
00:17:25,934 --> 00:17:27,567
So he knows I greatly mean it.

275
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:28,803
Magda!

276
00:17:28,805 --> 00:17:30,971
Charles?
You made it!

277
00:17:30,973 --> 00:17:33,840
The wedding's off, Magda.

278
00:17:33,842 --> 00:17:37,444
You oughta know there are
plenty of fish in the sea.

279
00:17:37,446 --> 00:17:38,813
Told you.

280
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,615
You've done enough damage!

281
00:17:40,617 --> 00:17:42,616
I won't let you
harm anyone else!

282
00:17:42,618 --> 00:17:44,250
Not on my account!

283
00:17:44,252 --> 00:17:48,088
Then get down on one knee
and propose to me!

284
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:52,359
Maybe after
a few more dates first.

285
00:17:52,361 --> 00:17:54,163
Bring him to me!

286
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:12,613
No!

287
00:18:12,615 --> 00:18:14,347
It can't be! S...

288
00:18:14,349 --> 00:18:15,582
Snowy!

289
00:18:15,584 --> 00:18:17,151
Charles?

290
00:18:17,153 --> 00:18:18,585
This guy's gonna
get himself killed.

291
00:18:18,587 --> 00:18:20,290
Or worse... married.

292
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,035
Get away from him!

293
00:18:56,026 --> 00:18:57,761
Hiya, Chuckie.

294
00:19:09,305 --> 00:19:11,071
Come on, Chuckie.

295
00:19:11,073 --> 00:19:12,373
You and me?

296
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,810
We're going through
the Looking Glass

297
00:19:27,223 --> 00:19:28,625
Yeah.

298
00:19:33,695 --> 00:19:35,098
Oh, no.

299
00:19:36,698 --> 00:19:38,598
- Let's go!
- Okay. Okay!

300
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,867
Wait!

301
00:19:40,869 --> 00:19:42,869
Where have you gone now,
my Charming?

302
00:19:42,871 --> 00:19:45,672
- Again?
- Commitment issues.

303
00:19:45,674 --> 00:19:47,474
Maybe that's our cue too!

304
00:19:47,476 --> 00:19:49,242
Oh, he couldn't
have gotten far.

305
00:19:49,244 --> 00:19:51,679
If there's anywhere I know
you're off fighting some battle.

306
00:19:51,681 --> 00:19:53,950
Can we, can we...?

307
00:19:57,052 --> 00:19:58,921
- Fall back!
- Yeah.

308
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,691
Was it a nice date?

309
00:20:03,693 --> 00:20:06,059
Shame he doesn't seem
to have come up!

310
00:20:06,061 --> 00:20:08,662
Well, Magda doesn't
have him either.

311
00:20:08,664 --> 00:20:09,730
Not yet.

312
00:20:09,732 --> 00:20:12,133
What happened?

313
00:20:12,135 --> 00:20:14,000
We lost him!

314
00:20:14,002 --> 00:20:15,869
Wait a minute.
What's that?

315
00:20:15,871 --> 00:20:18,538
Where is this?

316
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,109
That's here.

317
00:20:33,556 --> 00:20:35,959
Hello, beautifuls.

318
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,494
My darling!

319
00:20:41,496 --> 00:20:44,800
It has been such a long time.

320
00:20:48,771 --> 00:20:49,970
Snowy!

321
00:20:49,972 --> 00:20:51,571
Yes, of course!

322
00:20:51,573 --> 00:20:54,942
We sure showed those fish men
what for, didn't we?

323
00:20:54,944 --> 00:20:57,912
Just like old times.

324
00:20:57,914 --> 00:21:00,580
You and me.

325
00:21:00,582 --> 00:21:02,048
Prince Charming!

326
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,184
Is this guy for real?

327
00:21:04,186 --> 00:21:06,053
I don't see it.

328
00:21:06,055 --> 00:21:08,154
So what happened out there?

329
00:21:08,156 --> 00:21:09,388
Ah, yes.

330
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:14,461
Well, during the tussle,
I saw this creepy fellow

331
00:21:14,463 --> 00:21:18,799
trying to sneak away
from the scrap.

332
00:21:18,801 --> 00:21:21,768
Now, if you all follow me...

333
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:24,174
I've been playing around
with an idea.

334
00:21:25,974 --> 00:21:29,343
And I figured I'd use
this little doohickey

335
00:21:29,345 --> 00:21:32,115
here to send him back
where he came from.

336
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:44,825
Take the gag out.

337
00:21:44,827 --> 00:21:47,728
I'd rather not.

338
00:21:51,901 --> 00:21:54,969
I don't care what
you're plotting.

339
00:21:54,971 --> 00:21:59,205
But I'm warning you,
I'll not have it!

340
00:21:59,207 --> 00:22:01,008
Miss, I don't know
who you are.

341
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:03,313
But that man is an imposter.

342
00:22:05,012 --> 00:22:07,114
I thought I killed you!

343
00:22:07,116 --> 00:22:11,919
Different... Rumpel...
stiltskin!

344
00:22:13,155 --> 00:22:15,823
Oh, God!
The Gateway!

345
00:22:15,825 --> 00:22:18,094
Lady, untie me!

346
00:22:39,482 --> 00:22:41,917
Snowy! The ring!

347
00:22:58,166 --> 00:23:00,336
No!

348
00:23:12,348 --> 00:23:13,847
I'm impressed.

349
00:23:13,849 --> 00:23:16,151
Hmm, I knew you would be.

350
00:23:20,822 --> 00:23:25,991
You've managed to capture
Charles, retrieve my ring,

351
00:23:25,993 --> 00:23:30,463
and rid me of Snow White.

352
00:23:30,465 --> 00:23:31,798
Where did you send them?

353
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,336
Where? When?
Who cares?

354
00:23:35,338 --> 00:23:40,339
Let's just say I sent them back
to "Once upon a time..."

355
00:23:40,341 --> 00:23:44,848
So save the date, sweetheart.
The wedding's back on.

356
00:23:45,947 --> 00:23:48,649
So what do you say?

357
00:23:48,651 --> 00:23:50,017
Do I get the gig?

358
00:23:50,019 --> 00:23:52,952
He still needs to propose.

359
00:23:52,954 --> 00:23:54,689
He'll come around.

360
00:23:54,691 --> 00:23:59,993
You did... remove Snow White...

361
00:23:59,995 --> 00:24:02,762
like you promised.

362
00:24:02,764 --> 00:24:07,667
Just in case, take a dozen
Mermen into the Gateway.

363
00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:10,837
Orders:
Seek and destroy.

364
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:13,140
Have it disabled afterwards.

365
00:24:13,142 --> 00:24:15,578
I don't want them coming back.

366
00:24:16,712 --> 00:24:20,080
From now on, no one
gets through this gate,

367
00:24:20,082 --> 00:24:22,415
unless it's under my orders!

368
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:25,853
Now go!

369
00:24:25,855 --> 00:24:30,093
Your sacrifice
will be celebrated.

370
00:24:34,328 --> 00:24:37,530
You are two for two,
my friend.

371
00:24:37,532 --> 00:24:40,270
Keep it up,
you'll have Atlantis yet.

372
00:24:45,675 --> 00:24:49,979
Pick him up and put him
in something nice.

373
00:25:00,923 --> 00:25:03,159
And kill anyone else inside!

374
00:26:04,786 --> 00:26:06,589
Well, that's not right.

375
00:26:14,597 --> 00:26:17,364
Wait a minute.

376
00:26:17,366 --> 00:26:19,434
I know these woods.

377
00:26:23,105 --> 00:26:25,174
The dwarves must be close by.

378
00:26:32,114 --> 00:26:37,084
Back up.
This looks freshly carved.

379
00:26:37,086 --> 00:26:39,756
I must have just
missed them.

380
00:27:20,629 --> 00:27:22,127
How do I get back?

381
00:27:22,129 --> 00:27:24,466
Where are the others?

382
00:27:25,901 --> 00:27:28,604
All right.

383
00:27:30,371 --> 00:27:33,408
How many of you guppies
do I gotta kill?

384
00:27:35,644 --> 00:27:37,512
I'll ask them.

385
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:43,618
Old school, it is.

386
00:27:55,197 --> 00:27:56,762
No.

387
00:27:56,764 --> 00:28:00,569
No. No, no, no,
no, no, not again!

388
00:28:02,971 --> 00:28:06,272
Don't freak out,
don't freak out!

389
00:28:14,148 --> 00:28:16,886
Small spaces are no big deal!

390
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,862
Ow!

391
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,569
Just in case.

392
00:28:37,873 --> 00:28:39,705
Thanks, Red.

393
00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:50,483
Hey, hey!

394
00:29:34,195 --> 00:29:36,262
Oh, not good.

395
00:29:36,264 --> 00:29:39,932
No, no, no, very bad indeed.

396
00:29:39,934 --> 00:29:42,602
Don't worry, Alice.
All is not yet lost.

397
00:29:42,604 --> 00:29:44,505
We just need the power core
to bring them back

398
00:29:44,507 --> 00:29:47,874
and we just need
to find them first.

399
00:29:47,876 --> 00:29:49,242
Alice?

400
00:29:49,244 --> 00:29:50,310
Hatter?

401
00:29:50,312 --> 00:29:52,912
I've a present for you, Alice.

402
00:29:52,914 --> 00:29:54,550
Alice, come along now!

403
00:29:55,416 --> 00:29:58,320
Come along now!

404
00:30:13,702 --> 00:30:15,871
Put it with
the other presents.

405
00:30:22,144 --> 00:30:23,546
And wrap it!

406
00:30:26,548 --> 00:30:32,051
Unhand me, you
amphibious abomination!

407
00:30:32,053 --> 00:30:37,891
Now, Charles, is that any
way to treat the help?

408
00:30:37,893 --> 00:30:42,095
You're a Prince, darling.

409
00:30:42,097 --> 00:30:46,532
Soon you'll be a King.

410
00:30:46,534 --> 00:30:48,835
Show some manners.

411
00:30:48,837 --> 00:30:52,506
I swear it, if you've hurt
my beloved Snow, I will...

412
00:30:52,508 --> 00:30:54,644
You'll do what?

413
00:30:57,044 --> 00:31:01,016
Don't think about
her anymore, Charles.

414
00:31:03,484 --> 00:31:06,086
She's in the past.

415
00:31:06,088 --> 00:31:07,653
Impossible.

416
00:31:07,655 --> 00:31:12,092
I think about her all the time.

417
00:31:12,094 --> 00:31:16,332
Every waking moment.

418
00:31:18,133 --> 00:31:22,169
No matter how dank the cell
you confine me to

419
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:26,006
or how unspeakable the
tortures you subject me to

420
00:31:26,008 --> 00:31:29,075
or how long you confine me
to the darkest depths

421
00:31:29,077 --> 00:31:34,314
of that abysmal abyssal
place you call Atlantis,

422
00:31:34,316 --> 00:31:38,551
you will never touch my love for
her, you wretched water witch!

423
00:31:38,553 --> 00:31:41,221
You fiendish fetid
fish-faced flounder

424
00:31:41,223 --> 00:31:44,358
who will forever be remembered
as nothing more

425
00:31:45,424 --> 00:31:47,896
than an up-jumped
usurping urchin.

426
00:31:49,931 --> 00:31:53,199
You'll never know
a love like that, Magda.

427
00:31:53,201 --> 00:31:55,838
Least of all, from me.

428
00:31:57,505 --> 00:31:59,873
We'll see about that.

429
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:01,577
Take him away!

430
00:32:10,685 --> 00:32:16,123
You... you said
you'd convince him!

431
00:32:16,125 --> 00:32:18,724
Maybe you didn't see it
from your little hiding place,

432
00:32:18,726 --> 00:32:21,894
but he did not look convinced!

433
00:32:21,896 --> 00:32:25,097
He'll come around, trust me.

434
00:32:25,099 --> 00:32:27,034
This will all work out.

435
00:32:27,036 --> 00:32:29,501
What is it then?

436
00:32:29,503 --> 00:32:30,703
Threaten the city again?

437
00:32:30,705 --> 00:32:32,673
Torture him until he marries me?

438
00:32:32,675 --> 00:32:35,008
No, no, nothing like that.

439
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:37,144
Look, you've just
seen the opening act.

440
00:32:37,146 --> 00:32:41,213
But now, it's time
for the main event.

441
00:32:41,215 --> 00:32:44,684
And what I have in mind

442
00:32:44,686 --> 00:32:48,422
will take a
little more finesse.

443
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:50,760
And even you'll play a part.

444
00:33:23,558 --> 00:33:25,792
That's weird.

445
00:33:25,794 --> 00:33:27,796
They gotta be around
here somewhere.

446
00:33:41,342 --> 00:33:43,844
Seven...

447
00:33:43,846 --> 00:33:46,179
Oh, no.

448
00:33:46,181 --> 00:33:47,550
No!

449
00:34:13,107 --> 00:34:18,145
You were always there
to protect me.

450
00:34:18,147 --> 00:34:21,484
I'm sorry I wasn't there
to protect you.

451
00:34:22,751 --> 00:34:25,120
You deserved so much
better than this.

452
00:34:31,526 --> 00:34:34,263
Magda will pay!

453
00:34:36,664 --> 00:34:38,665
The Queen wants you dead!

454
00:34:38,667 --> 00:34:41,636
Tell the Queen
to take a number.

455
00:34:49,577 --> 00:34:51,246
Am I supposed to be impressed?

456
00:34:54,348 --> 00:34:56,084
Well, the hard way, it is.

457
00:35:42,631 --> 00:35:44,098
Five out of seven.

458
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,702
Thank you, boys.

459
00:35:53,809 --> 00:35:57,209
How will you convince him?

460
00:35:57,211 --> 00:36:00,446
Magda, it's what I do.

461
00:36:00,448 --> 00:36:06,386
I'm beginning to wonder
exactly what you're up to.

462
00:36:06,388 --> 00:36:07,787
Uh-uh.

463
00:36:07,789 --> 00:36:11,089
I told you: I want Atlantis.

464
00:36:11,091 --> 00:36:15,562
If I have to play matchmaker,
it's a small price to pay.

465
00:36:15,564 --> 00:36:16,932
Hmm.

466
00:36:19,368 --> 00:36:24,705
If I find out you're lying
to me, I'll skin you alive.

467
00:36:24,707 --> 00:36:29,142
And feed you to the sharks.

468
00:36:29,144 --> 00:36:31,477
Noted.

469
00:36:31,479 --> 00:36:35,048
Now...

470
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:36,218
Oof!

471
00:36:37,785 --> 00:36:40,789
Hey, flipper,
how's your acting?

472
00:36:41,656 --> 00:36:44,357
One more try!

473
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:46,828
Aargh!

474
00:36:50,131 --> 00:36:51,834
Unhand me!

475
00:36:55,269 --> 00:36:56,870
I'll never talk... oh!

476
00:36:56,872 --> 00:36:59,372
A little too method there, pal.

477
00:36:59,374 --> 00:37:00,809
Enough, man!

478
00:37:04,479 --> 00:37:05,881
Point taken.

479
00:37:07,881 --> 00:37:10,883
Why not try that on me?

480
00:37:10,885 --> 00:37:14,319
So, what are you in for?

481
00:37:14,321 --> 00:37:17,156
Do I know you, friend?

482
00:37:17,158 --> 00:37:19,028
Name's Rupert.

483
00:37:23,798 --> 00:37:27,702
It's a long story, Rupert.

484
00:37:33,341 --> 00:37:36,310
I've got time.

485
00:37:38,146 --> 00:37:44,049
Once upon a time, I was
Prince Charles Charming III.

486
00:37:44,051 --> 00:37:46,384
And together with my
beloved Snow White,

487
00:37:46,386 --> 00:37:50,290
we had some adventures
together, Rupert.

488
00:37:50,292 --> 00:37:54,428
There was no foe
we couldn't beat.

489
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:56,763
No spell we couldn't break.

490
00:37:56,765 --> 00:38:00,066
There was nothing in all
the kingdom

491
00:38:00,068 --> 00:38:04,602
that could rival
our combined might.

492
00:38:04,604 --> 00:38:06,240
Our love for one another.

493
00:38:08,542 --> 00:38:10,945
We were their heroes.

494
00:38:11,946 --> 00:38:14,450
I was their hero.

495
00:38:16,051 --> 00:38:21,053
But, alas,
our tale was not meant

496
00:38:21,055 --> 00:38:23,957
for happily ever afters.

497
00:38:23,959 --> 00:38:28,861
Though it was the realm
who wished for us to rule,

498
00:38:28,863 --> 00:38:32,964
there were others whose
jealousy festered.

499
00:38:32,966 --> 00:38:37,169
And none more than
Magda, the Mad.

500
00:38:37,171 --> 00:38:39,705
Banished and confined
to the seas,

501
00:38:39,707 --> 00:38:44,776
Atlantis long had a
tenuous truce with the land.

502
00:38:44,778 --> 00:38:49,582
But the oceans weren't enough
to quell Magda's lust.

503
00:38:49,584 --> 00:38:53,687
On the eve of my wedding,
it was her siren song

504
00:38:53,689 --> 00:38:55,821
that lured me to the shores.

505
00:38:57,258 --> 00:39:00,160
I never could resist
the call of adventure.

506
00:39:00,162 --> 00:39:03,095
And what a wedding gift,
the seat of Atlantis

507
00:39:03,097 --> 00:39:06,234
for my beloved Queen-to-be.

508
00:39:08,236 --> 00:39:12,171
And, surely, I'd be back
for the cake.

509
00:39:12,173 --> 00:39:16,609
But Magda's trap
was already sprung.

510
00:39:16,611 --> 00:39:19,879
I was imprisoned in
Atlantis for so long!

511
00:39:19,881 --> 00:39:21,881
Ages!

512
00:39:21,883 --> 00:39:25,854
It felt like a lifetime.

513
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:29,421
Now I...

514
00:39:29,423 --> 00:39:34,627
I don't know where or
when I am anymore, Rupert.

515
00:39:34,629 --> 00:39:37,564
Or who I'm even supposed to be

516
00:39:37,566 --> 00:39:42,903
in this strange foreign place.

517
00:39:42,905 --> 00:39:47,939
It's not love for me
that motivates Magda.

518
00:39:47,941 --> 00:39:52,779
No, it's power,

519
00:39:52,781 --> 00:39:54,550
power of my ring.

520
00:39:57,285 --> 00:40:00,051
The power I'm not even sure
I ever truly wanted

521
00:40:00,053 --> 00:40:01,889
in the first place.

522
00:40:03,124 --> 00:40:06,660
So, whoever you put
that ring on

523
00:40:06,662 --> 00:40:09,428
has power over all the land?

524
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:11,199
Precisely.

525
00:40:13,135 --> 00:40:16,669
We're talking everything?

526
00:40:16,671 --> 00:40:18,372
All of it.

527
00:40:21,676 --> 00:40:22,841
Like?

528
00:40:22,843 --> 00:40:26,345
All the known land!

529
00:40:28,617 --> 00:40:32,250
Pray, what about you, Rupert?

530
00:40:32,252 --> 00:40:36,522
How is it that you've
come to share my fate?

531
00:40:36,524 --> 00:40:37,892
Well...

532
00:40:40,327 --> 00:40:44,997
It is your
lucky day, Charlie.

533
00:40:44,999 --> 00:40:47,100
I'm here to help you.

534
00:40:47,102 --> 00:40:52,004
I've been working
with a third party.

535
00:40:52,006 --> 00:40:53,872
Magda found out.

536
00:40:53,874 --> 00:40:56,542
So now I'm here.

537
00:40:56,544 --> 00:40:59,544
What third party?

538
00:40:59,546 --> 00:41:01,180
Alice.

539
00:41:01,182 --> 00:41:05,852
Well, then I hope this Alice

540
00:41:05,854 --> 00:41:08,421
is as clever as you suspect.

541
00:41:08,423 --> 00:41:12,993
Or else you and I may
find ourselves old men

542
00:41:12,995 --> 00:41:17,132
before this perilous
plot is through.

543
00:41:21,336 --> 00:41:23,669
Thank goodness
you're all right.

544
00:41:23,671 --> 00:41:25,104
Tell me, Hatter.

545
00:41:25,106 --> 00:41:27,040
Have you had time
to prepare my medicine?

546
00:41:27,042 --> 00:41:30,977
Oh, yeah, small dose.

547
00:41:30,979 --> 00:41:32,511
Don't take too much
of that stuff.

548
00:41:32,513 --> 00:41:35,115
You're liable
to stick that way.

549
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:37,783
Splendid.

550
00:41:37,785 --> 00:41:39,852
You stay put a little
while longer, Hatter.

551
00:41:39,854 --> 00:41:44,156
I think it's high time we got
these Mermen out of my building.

552
00:41:44,158 --> 00:41:48,194
It's going to take
no small effort.

553
00:41:48,196 --> 00:41:50,232
Okay, let's go.

554
00:41:54,068 --> 00:41:56,705
All right, Alice.
Just like before.

555
00:42:09,651 --> 00:42:11,316
Well, can't blame you
for overlooking

556
00:42:11,318 --> 00:42:13,021
the small things, can we?

557
00:42:13,854 --> 00:42:16,654
Uh, have we won yet?

558
00:42:16,656 --> 00:42:18,024
I'm afraid not, Hatter.

559
00:42:18,026 --> 00:42:19,892
It's as I suspected.

560
00:42:19,894 --> 00:42:22,227
If we're going to find out
where and when Snow White

561
00:42:22,229 --> 00:42:23,763
and the others wound up,

562
00:42:23,765 --> 00:42:26,232
I'll need the Gateway
operational again.

563
00:42:26,234 --> 00:42:28,100
I don't suppose you have
any expertise

564
00:42:28,102 --> 00:42:30,401
in inter-dimensional
time travel, do you?

565
00:42:30,403 --> 00:42:34,107
Um, only of
the hallucinogenic sort.

566
00:42:34,109 --> 00:42:37,109
Of course.
Of course!

567
00:42:37,111 --> 00:42:38,678
Hatter, that's it!

568
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,948
It's nearly tea time,
I'm afraid.

569
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:43,616
Oh, lovely.

570
00:42:43,618 --> 00:42:47,187
Why don't you prepare a
pot of your special brew, hmm?

571
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:49,455
Do you think it might help
you in locating

572
00:42:49,457 --> 00:42:51,957
our time-displaced defenders?

573
00:42:51,959 --> 00:42:56,127
Um, it couldn't hurt.

574
00:42:56,129 --> 00:42:58,064
Shall I make you a cuppa?

575
00:42:58,066 --> 00:42:59,832
Oh, no, darling,
not right now. Thank you.

576
00:42:59,834 --> 00:43:02,267
I'll need my wits about me
if I'm going to get

577
00:43:02,269 --> 00:43:04,636
this little tumble down
the rabbit hole back

578
00:43:04,638 --> 00:43:06,205
on proper footing.

579
00:43:06,207 --> 00:43:09,209
You stay here. Focus on locating
our lost girls.

580
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:11,176
And bar the door behind me.

581
00:43:11,178 --> 00:43:13,145
I've a sortie to sort out.

582
00:43:13,147 --> 00:43:15,147
Off to see the Queen then?

583
00:43:15,149 --> 00:43:17,015
Precisely, Hatter.

584
00:43:17,017 --> 00:43:19,553
But let's hope
she doesn't see me.

585
00:43:21,722 --> 00:43:23,421
You listening, pal?

586
00:43:23,423 --> 00:43:24,924
Come on.

587
00:43:24,926 --> 00:43:27,158
Just a little longer,
and this will all work out.

588
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:30,162
Forgive me, Rupert,

589
00:43:30,164 --> 00:43:33,665
but what's the point?

590
00:43:33,667 --> 00:43:37,236
I no longer care what
Magda does to me.

591
00:43:37,238 --> 00:43:41,473
Snow White is dead.
And with her, my will to fight.

592
00:43:41,475 --> 00:43:45,912
Let this play out just a
little longer and...

593
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:48,714
No, no, no!

594
00:43:48,716 --> 00:43:50,049
Let go of him!

595
00:43:50,051 --> 00:43:52,350
No! No!

596
00:43:52,352 --> 00:43:55,156
Rupert!
Aargh!

597
00:44:00,194 --> 00:44:02,028
Well?

598
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:04,330
Woo, boy!

599
00:44:04,332 --> 00:44:06,031
Tough nut to crack.

600
00:44:06,033 --> 00:44:08,033
Your boy is depressed.

601
00:44:08,035 --> 00:44:12,538
It looks like your plan to get
rid of Snow White failed then!

602
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:14,372
He's lost his will to live.

603
00:44:14,374 --> 00:44:17,410
And I need him pliable.

604
00:44:17,412 --> 00:44:19,779
Back to Plan A then.

605
00:44:19,781 --> 00:44:21,513
Sorry, deal's off!

606
00:44:21,515 --> 00:44:24,517
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down. Listen.

607
00:44:24,519 --> 00:44:27,319
If he's lost his will to live,

608
00:44:27,321 --> 00:44:30,656
we just have to give him
something to live for.

609
00:44:30,658 --> 00:44:33,627
You better know
what you're doing.

610
00:44:38,932 --> 00:44:41,202
No!

611
00:44:54,214 --> 00:44:56,684
Rupert, you're alive.

612
00:44:59,453 --> 00:45:03,154
Magda. She knows.

613
00:45:03,156 --> 00:45:05,823
Knows I'm a double agent.

614
00:45:05,825 --> 00:45:10,296
And she had questions.

615
00:45:10,298 --> 00:45:13,531
And I gather she didn't
ask them very nicely.

616
00:45:13,533 --> 00:45:15,734
I didn't answer any of them.

617
00:45:15,736 --> 00:45:19,337
Well, good on you
then, Rupert.

618
00:45:19,339 --> 00:45:22,544
I did gather
some information.

619
00:45:24,312 --> 00:45:25,647
Snow White?

620
00:45:28,917 --> 00:45:30,485
She's alive.

621
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:56,745
Wait for it...

622
00:46:01,149 --> 00:46:03,251
50 degrees west.

623
00:46:07,488 --> 00:46:09,823
Change by six
degrees for the wind.

624
00:46:13,827 --> 00:46:17,932
Three targets all
lined up in a row.

625
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:29,944
Idiots.

626
00:46:31,546 --> 00:46:35,548
Their average response time
is three minutes and 48 seconds.

627
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:38,283
It's an all you can eat
seafood buffet out here, Snow.

628
00:46:38,285 --> 00:46:39,886
And there's gonna
be more coming up.

629
00:46:39,888 --> 00:46:44,957
Soon as I kill one,
another school shows up.

630
00:46:44,959 --> 00:46:46,994
I'm down to just with my arrows.

631
00:46:48,162 --> 00:46:50,162
I ran into one too.

632
00:46:50,164 --> 00:46:51,497
But this one was different.

633
00:46:51,499 --> 00:46:53,165
He was ready for me.

634
00:46:53,167 --> 00:46:55,734
Yeah. I'm pretty sure the last
time I was in these woods,

635
00:46:55,736 --> 00:46:58,169
they weren't crawling
with Magda's Mermen.

636
00:46:58,171 --> 00:47:01,173
Something's different.

637
00:47:01,175 --> 00:47:03,341
It's really changed.

638
00:47:03,343 --> 00:47:06,078
If Magda somehow
marries Charles,

639
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,881
she controls all the land.

640
00:47:08,883 --> 00:47:11,015
Including the Gateway.

641
00:47:11,017 --> 00:47:13,986
Red, I don't think
we were just sent back home.

642
00:47:13,988 --> 00:47:17,756
I think we were sent back
in time or to another dimension.

643
00:47:17,758 --> 00:47:19,459
We need to figure out
how to get back

644
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:21,627
and then we can fix all of this!

645
00:47:21,629 --> 00:47:25,631
If Magda's using the Gateway
to send back all these Mermen...

646
00:47:25,633 --> 00:47:27,600
Then we could
use it to get back!

647
00:47:27,602 --> 00:47:30,602
Why else would she be sending
all these Mermen to get us

648
00:47:30,604 --> 00:47:32,437
and anyone who would help us?

649
00:47:32,439 --> 00:47:34,506
We need to get back
to before the wedding.

650
00:47:34,508 --> 00:47:38,176
Then we could prevent all
of this from happening.

651
00:47:38,178 --> 00:47:40,145
Do you know which way
the Mermen were coming from?

652
00:47:40,147 --> 00:47:41,580
Yeah.

653
00:47:41,582 --> 00:47:44,183
Somewhere back that way
where I came from.

654
00:47:44,185 --> 00:47:47,252
- You know the way?
- Sure.

655
00:47:47,254 --> 00:47:50,392
Just, you know,
follow the bread crumbs.

656
00:48:04,138 --> 00:48:07,509
Let's see those gills
handle a full dose.

657
00:48:09,843 --> 00:48:11,546
Come on.

658
00:48:21,222 --> 00:48:22,955
That's right.

659
00:48:22,957 --> 00:48:25,093
Breathe it in.

660
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:34,002
Now do as I say!

661
00:48:37,838 --> 00:48:39,540
Come on.

662
00:48:44,044 --> 00:48:45,713
Goodie!

663
00:48:54,155 --> 00:48:56,057
I'm not so stupid, after all.

664
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:03,798
This'll do nicely.

665
00:49:07,734 --> 00:49:09,368
Oh, that must be
Sleeping Beauty.

666
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:12,037
Good for her. I thought we'd
have to rescue her.

667
00:49:12,039 --> 00:49:14,071
Well, that's not
very far from here.

668
00:49:14,073 --> 00:49:15,439
Yeah. It looks like it's
where we're headed.

669
00:49:15,441 --> 00:49:17,176
But it could be a trap.

670
00:49:17,178 --> 00:49:18,511
- Can we afford to be careful?
- No. She could be in trouble.

671
00:49:18,513 --> 00:49:21,080
We'd better hurry.

672
00:49:21,082 --> 00:49:24,249
So what's the plan?
Where is Snow White?

673
00:49:24,251 --> 00:49:26,953
Surely, you have a way
of getting us out then?

674
00:49:26,955 --> 00:49:28,386
Better.

675
00:49:28,388 --> 00:49:29,488
What if I told you there is a

676
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:30,522
way of getting you out of here

677
00:49:30,524 --> 00:49:32,325
and to marry Snow White?

678
00:49:32,327 --> 00:49:33,457
How, man?

679
00:49:33,459 --> 00:49:35,127
Easy.
All you have to do is...

680
00:49:35,129 --> 00:49:36,662
Oh.

681
00:49:36,664 --> 00:49:37,863
No. No, no, no!

682
00:49:39,167 --> 00:49:40,966
No!

683
00:49:40,968 --> 00:49:42,535
Come on!

684
00:49:42,537 --> 00:49:44,002
How? How?

685
00:49:44,004 --> 00:49:45,537
Rupert, how?

686
00:49:45,539 --> 00:49:47,573
How, Rupert!
Rupert!

687
00:49:50,176 --> 00:49:52,812
Time's up, sweet talker!

688
00:49:52,814 --> 00:49:55,113
Easy!

689
00:49:55,115 --> 00:49:58,452
He bought it,
hook, line and sinker!

690
00:50:01,354 --> 00:50:03,256
Just give it some time.

691
00:50:03,258 --> 00:50:04,723
Let it marinate.

692
00:50:04,725 --> 00:50:06,158
And you'll be the happy

693
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,792
couple before you know it.

694
00:50:07,794 --> 00:50:09,428
I'm going to ask him myself.

695
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:11,529
No, no, no, no!

696
00:50:11,531 --> 00:50:17,270
Look, the groom can't see
the bride before the wedding.

697
00:50:17,272 --> 00:50:19,037
Why don't you go?
Get spruced up.

698
00:50:19,039 --> 00:50:22,140
I'll bring him to the altar
when it's time.

699
00:50:22,142 --> 00:50:24,977
It better be soon.

700
00:50:24,979 --> 00:50:27,613
For all we know,
Snow White and her Avengers

701
00:50:27,615 --> 00:50:30,549
could have found a way back!

702
00:50:30,551 --> 00:50:34,653
I don't want any
uninvited guests.

703
00:50:34,655 --> 00:50:36,754
I should have
killed them myself.

704
00:50:36,756 --> 00:50:40,191
No. Trust me.
Give it time.

705
00:50:40,193 --> 00:50:41,993
You'll be glad you did.

706
00:50:41,995 --> 00:50:44,531
One hour!

707
00:50:50,203 --> 00:50:51,571
Rumpelstiltskin!

708
00:50:51,573 --> 00:50:53,305
Oh!

709
00:50:53,307 --> 00:50:54,839
That's your trick!

710
00:50:54,841 --> 00:50:56,674
What are you doing here?

711
00:50:56,676 --> 00:50:59,611
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

712
00:50:59,613 --> 00:51:01,613
When I last checked,
you were happily running

713
00:51:01,615 --> 00:51:04,448
the Underworld with
the Queen of Hearts.

714
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:06,953
How is Gelda, by the way?

715
00:51:06,955 --> 00:51:10,622
Good, I think.

716
00:51:10,624 --> 00:51:12,725
You two don't still talk,
do you?

717
00:51:12,727 --> 00:51:14,426
Oh, but we can.

718
00:51:14,428 --> 00:51:17,229
And I'd be happy to inform her
of your current whereabouts

719
00:51:17,231 --> 00:51:19,330
unless you tell me
exactly what's going on!

720
00:51:19,332 --> 00:51:23,569
The wedding is in an hour.
But I have a plan.

721
00:51:23,571 --> 00:51:25,370
Of course, you do.

722
00:51:25,372 --> 00:51:27,575
And why should I trust you?

723
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:33,678
Look, okay, Alice.

724
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:38,049
Yes, did I help Magda
capture Prince Charming?

725
00:51:38,051 --> 00:51:41,252
And get rid of the Avengers?
Yes.

726
00:51:41,254 --> 00:51:46,591
But it was a con and
it didn't pan out.

727
00:51:46,593 --> 00:51:49,495
I think she's catching
on to me.

728
00:51:49,497 --> 00:51:50,796
She's crazy.

729
00:51:50,798 --> 00:51:53,131
They don't call her Magda,

730
00:51:53,133 --> 00:51:54,700
the Mad for nothing.

731
00:51:54,702 --> 00:51:57,602
Anyway, it's good thing
that you're here.

732
00:51:57,604 --> 00:51:59,270
I need a way out.

733
00:51:59,272 --> 00:52:02,908
And how do I know this isn't
just part of your scheme?

734
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:08,013
You don't, but what if
I got you the power core

735
00:52:08,015 --> 00:52:10,816
and showed you where
Price Charles is, huh?

736
00:52:10,818 --> 00:52:12,917
We could call it a wash?

737
00:52:12,919 --> 00:52:16,921
If I could free Charming
and reopen the Gateway,

738
00:52:16,923 --> 00:52:19,258
then we'd rid ourselves
of this whole mess.

739
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:23,294
Oh, deal.

740
00:52:23,296 --> 00:52:25,397
Now where is he?

741
00:52:25,399 --> 00:52:27,167
Right this way.

742
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:33,738
Why is it every time I find
myself in a mess, I also find...

743
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:36,475
What is this?
Who is she?

744
00:52:36,477 --> 00:52:38,144
You!

745
00:52:38,146 --> 00:52:39,544
I found her running
around trying

746
00:52:39,546 --> 00:52:40,745
to sneak off with your man.

747
00:52:40,747 --> 00:52:43,984
Then I guess she... dies!

748
00:52:45,385 --> 00:52:46,685
Oh!

749
00:52:46,687 --> 00:52:49,624
Where is she?
After her!

750
00:52:54,193 --> 00:52:57,895
I'll make sure you regret this,
Rumpelstiltskin!

751
00:52:57,897 --> 00:52:59,934
Sorry, small stuff.

752
00:53:04,638 --> 00:53:06,238
Oh!

753
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:09,707
All right, Alice,
time to crack on!

754
00:53:09,709 --> 00:53:11,845
Oh, bugger!

755
00:53:18,586 --> 00:53:22,421
Well, it looks like I can
trust you, after all.

756
00:53:22,423 --> 00:53:27,694
Hmm. Magda, no one's gonna
crash your wedding.

757
00:53:29,629 --> 00:53:31,796
I still don't understand.

758
00:53:31,798 --> 00:53:35,267
In the present... or the
future,

759
00:53:35,269 --> 00:53:37,870
if Magda marries
your boy Charming,

760
00:53:37,872 --> 00:53:39,370
then she controls all of time?

761
00:53:39,372 --> 00:53:43,375
Because we weren't
there to stop her.

762
00:53:43,377 --> 00:53:45,511
All we have to do
is find a way back.

763
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:47,078
Then we can undo
all of this.

764
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,647
If we get back
to the right time.

765
00:53:48,649 --> 00:53:50,616
Yeah.
I know it's confusing.

766
00:53:50,618 --> 00:53:51,649
But all we have to focus
on right now

767
00:53:51,651 --> 00:53:53,419
is getting out of here!

768
00:53:53,421 --> 00:53:54,852
We're not gonna do anyone
any good if we're stuck

769
00:53:54,854 --> 00:53:55,854
in the past or some

770
00:53:55,856 --> 00:53:57,355
time-warp dimension!

771
00:53:57,357 --> 00:53:58,957
We're gonna have to time
this really carefully.

772
00:53:58,959 --> 00:54:00,658
First, we're gonna have
to find Sleeping Beauty.

773
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:03,828
Then we're gonna figure out
a way to lure the Mermen here.

774
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:05,196
Then we'll kill them.

775
00:54:05,198 --> 00:54:06,564
Then, hopefully,
the Gateway will open up

776
00:54:06,566 --> 00:54:09,500
and we'll just jump through it!

777
00:54:09,502 --> 00:54:10,972
Or we can wing it.

778
00:54:15,843 --> 00:54:17,508
Oh, hey.

779
00:54:17,510 --> 00:54:20,147
Now's our chance!
Move it or lose it, Sleepy!

780
00:54:23,482 --> 00:54:26,852
No, no, no, no, no!

781
00:54:26,854 --> 00:54:29,055
Please tell me
this wasn't part of your plan.

782
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:30,154
No!

783
00:54:30,156 --> 00:54:31,355
We must have gone too far.

784
00:54:31,357 --> 00:54:32,625
I don't understand it!

785
00:54:32,627 --> 00:54:34,359
Is this where the Mermen
are coming from?

786
00:54:34,361 --> 00:54:36,428
You mean, is this when
the Mermen were coming from?

787
00:54:36,430 --> 00:54:38,964
I guess Magda got what
she wanted after all.

788
00:54:38,966 --> 00:54:41,732
Sure looks like she made
herself at home.

789
00:54:41,734 --> 00:54:44,035
Without us here to stop her.

790
00:54:44,037 --> 00:54:47,573
She must have found
a way to marry Charles.

791
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:49,475
He must be around
here somewhere.

792
00:54:49,477 --> 00:54:52,944
So, right place, wrong time.

793
00:54:52,946 --> 00:54:56,814
Exactly, and I'm willing
to bet there's a way outta here.

794
00:54:56,816 --> 00:54:57,883
Looking Glass.

795
00:54:57,885 --> 00:54:59,821
There again?

796
00:55:01,488 --> 00:55:02,886
Think about it!

797
00:55:02,888 --> 00:55:04,555
Where else are the Mermen

798
00:55:04,557 --> 00:55:06,024
coming from if not here?

799
00:55:06,026 --> 00:55:07,926
Magda's probably been sending

800
00:55:07,928 --> 00:55:09,828
Mermen back for ages to kill us!

801
00:55:09,830 --> 00:55:11,363
There's still a chance.

802
00:55:11,365 --> 00:55:14,301
Yeah, if everyone
isn't already dead.

803
00:55:15,468 --> 00:55:17,771
There's only one way
to find out.

804
00:55:27,981 --> 00:55:30,917
Doesn't look exactly up
and running these days.

805
00:55:33,921 --> 00:55:35,986
There has to be a way.

806
00:55:35,988 --> 00:55:37,723
Magda might be crazy

807
00:55:37,725 --> 00:55:41,459
but she wouldn't just destroy
the Gateway now, would she?

808
00:55:41,461 --> 00:55:42,993
Wait!

809
00:55:42,995 --> 00:55:44,932
Does that mean
we're stuck here?

810
00:55:47,334 --> 00:55:49,169
I'd rather be back
in the coffin.

811
00:55:51,272 --> 00:55:53,571
Long story.

812
00:55:53,573 --> 00:55:57,408
Oh! How did this happen?

813
00:55:57,410 --> 00:55:58,445
I gave up.

814
00:56:00,314 --> 00:56:02,016
Charles...

815
00:56:09,955 --> 00:56:11,423
Oh, my Charles.

816
00:56:11,425 --> 00:56:14,558
My Charming.

817
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:19,730
I'm so sorry, Snowy.

818
00:56:19,732 --> 00:56:21,868
I thought you died.

819
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:27,973
I lost my will to fight her.

820
00:56:27,975 --> 00:56:32,977
I lost everything.

821
00:56:32,979 --> 00:56:38,549
After she took control,
I... I...

822
00:56:38,551 --> 00:56:43,990
My sweet, I just knew
I would see you again.

823
00:56:46,225 --> 00:56:49,296
I'm so sorry things
turned out the way they did.

824
00:56:52,165 --> 00:56:55,569
You've been gone for so long.

825
00:56:57,470 --> 00:57:01,074
We all lost hope that
you'd ever make it back.

826
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:06,881
And now that you have,
it's too late.

827
00:57:10,818 --> 00:57:14,319
She broke me, Snowy.

828
00:57:14,321 --> 00:57:18,960
After we...
after she...

829
00:57:19,892 --> 00:57:24,331
Hey, hey, it's okay.

830
00:57:25,164 --> 00:57:29,299
After she got my ring,

831
00:57:29,301 --> 00:57:33,140
she had no use
for me anymore.

832
00:57:34,807 --> 00:57:38,544
And without my power,

833
00:57:38,546 --> 00:57:43,515
well, I'm not the man
I used to be.

834
00:57:43,517 --> 00:57:46,984
I'll fix this,
all of this, Charles.

835
00:57:46,986 --> 00:57:48,220
We just have to get back
to the Gateway...

836
00:57:48,222 --> 00:57:49,787
You can't!
You can't!

837
00:57:49,789 --> 00:57:52,089
I will.

838
00:57:52,091 --> 00:57:55,229
Oh, my darling,
how long has it been?

839
00:57:55,995 --> 00:57:59,064
Too long.

840
00:57:59,066 --> 00:58:00,131
You just have to
tell me what's happened

841
00:58:00,133 --> 00:58:03,535
in all this time.

842
00:58:03,537 --> 00:58:05,372
I'll show you.

843
00:58:08,374 --> 00:58:12,044
Once Magda gained control,

844
00:58:12,046 --> 00:58:16,548
it still wasn't
enough for her.

845
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:22,153
She became paranoid, afraid
that one day you'd come back.

846
00:58:22,155 --> 00:58:25,689
For years, she sent Mermen
through the Gateway

847
00:58:25,691 --> 00:58:28,959
to find you, to kill you.

848
00:58:28,961 --> 00:58:30,462
We know how that turned out.

849
00:58:30,464 --> 00:58:32,964
Now she never leaves
that Throne Room.

850
00:58:32,966 --> 00:58:35,933
We fought her for
as long as we could.

851
00:58:35,935 --> 00:58:40,138
But she controls all the land.

852
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:43,908
I am the only one
she can't command.

853
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:46,713
And, well, am now an old man.

854
00:58:48,348 --> 00:58:49,548
We?

855
00:58:49,550 --> 00:58:51,950
We who, Charles?

856
00:58:51,952 --> 00:58:54,886
Who am I?

857
00:58:54,888 --> 00:58:58,022
That is a great puzzle.

858
00:58:58,024 --> 00:58:59,624
Alice?

859
00:58:59,626 --> 00:59:01,493
I think I once was.

860
00:59:01,495 --> 00:59:07,064
But I must have changed
several times since then.

861
00:59:07,066 --> 00:59:09,801
What happened to her?

862
00:59:09,803 --> 00:59:12,970
I can't explain myself to you

863
00:59:12,972 --> 00:59:16,207
because I'm not myself.

864
00:59:16,209 --> 00:59:20,178
She's been this way since...

865
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:21,749
since Hatter died.

866
00:59:23,984 --> 00:59:26,017
Feels like forever.

867
00:59:26,019 --> 00:59:29,488
Sometimes forever
is just a second.

868
00:59:29,490 --> 00:59:31,955
No kidding.

869
00:59:31,957 --> 00:59:33,158
Alice?

870
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:35,093
If you're in there,

871
00:59:35,095 --> 00:59:37,162
there's still hope.

872
00:59:37,164 --> 00:59:39,732
We just need to get back
to before the wedding.

873
00:59:39,734 --> 00:59:42,703
Before all this happened,
we could stop it.

874
00:59:44,772 --> 00:59:47,337
Can you help us fix the Gateway?

875
00:59:47,339 --> 00:59:49,075
Can you send us back?

876
00:59:51,912 --> 00:59:55,147
I can't go back to yesterday.

877
00:59:55,149 --> 00:59:57,948
I was a different person then.

878
00:59:57,950 --> 00:59:59,984
God, she's bonkers!

879
00:59:59,986 --> 01:00:02,053
The best people are.

880
01:00:02,055 --> 01:00:04,022
You must be mad, too.

881
01:00:04,024 --> 01:00:06,124
Else you wouldn't
have come here.

882
01:00:06,126 --> 01:00:08,727
Okay, so Alice is nuts.

883
01:00:08,729 --> 01:00:12,230
And Charming here is
an old geezer... no offense.

884
01:00:12,232 --> 01:00:15,033
So what now?

885
01:00:15,035 --> 01:00:17,035
We bring the fight
back to Magda?

886
01:00:17,037 --> 01:00:18,502
No!

887
01:00:18,504 --> 01:00:20,272
Our battle is in the past!

888
01:00:20,274 --> 01:00:23,040
Uh, you mean present.

889
01:00:23,042 --> 01:00:25,843
It's not here!
It's not now!

890
01:00:25,845 --> 01:00:29,413
It doesn't do us or them
any good to fight her here!

891
01:00:29,415 --> 01:00:33,252
We need to get back before
the wedding ever happened!

892
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:36,553
That's what started all of this!

893
01:00:36,555 --> 01:00:39,057
But you're half right.
We're going to see Magda.

894
01:00:39,059 --> 01:00:41,526
If she's been sending
the Mermen back all this time,

895
01:00:41,528 --> 01:00:44,895
she has a way
to open the Gateway.

896
01:00:44,897 --> 01:00:47,165
So we get in,
we figure out how

897
01:00:47,167 --> 01:00:51,102
and we get out,
preferably unseen.

898
01:00:51,104 --> 01:00:53,339
Stealth, I can do.

899
01:00:56,575 --> 01:01:01,779
Darling, can you
show us the way?

900
01:01:01,781 --> 01:01:03,816
No.

901
01:01:03,818 --> 01:01:06,283
The place is filled with Mermen

902
01:01:06,285 --> 01:01:09,687
and I fear I...

903
01:01:09,689 --> 01:01:12,792
I fear I wouldn't be
any good in a fight.

904
01:01:14,627 --> 01:01:19,363
Follow this path,
but be careful, Snowy.

905
01:01:19,365 --> 01:01:22,466
If she hears you,
she knows you're there,

906
01:01:22,468 --> 01:01:24,968
it will be too late.

907
01:01:24,970 --> 01:01:26,404
My ring.

908
01:01:26,406 --> 01:01:29,276
She commands anyone
who hears her.

909
01:01:31,944 --> 01:01:34,115
Now go.

910
01:01:38,952 --> 01:01:40,787
Go.

911
01:01:46,126 --> 01:01:49,560
Why aren't you in your cell?

912
01:01:49,562 --> 01:01:52,330
You know I don't like you
skulking around at night.

913
01:01:52,332 --> 01:01:54,332
You already tried
to betray me once!

914
01:01:54,334 --> 01:01:56,968
Did you forget?

915
01:01:56,970 --> 01:01:58,770
No! No, my Queen! No.

916
01:01:58,772 --> 01:02:01,839
I just thought that I could
be out if I were cleaning...

917
01:02:01,841 --> 01:02:04,508
You thought... wrong.

918
01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:07,278
I'm sorry.
It's just that...

919
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:11,850
Get back to your cell.

920
01:02:11,852 --> 01:02:15,285
I'll just...

921
01:02:15,287 --> 01:02:17,020
Please don't make me go!

922
01:02:17,022 --> 01:02:22,629
I said get back
to your cell.

923
01:02:25,198 --> 01:02:27,600
Y.. Yes, my Queen.

924
01:02:51,156 --> 01:02:54,526
If only I could spin this straw
into something more useful.

925
01:03:01,801 --> 01:03:02,801
You're back!

926
01:03:02,803 --> 01:03:04,935
Shh!

927
01:03:04,937 --> 01:03:06,270
But you're back...

928
01:03:06,272 --> 01:03:07,538
Oh, we are not here
to rescue you.

929
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:09,006
This is all your fault.

930
01:03:09,008 --> 01:03:10,975
You're lucky I don't kill you!

931
01:03:10,977 --> 01:03:13,310
Oh, sweet death.

932
01:03:13,312 --> 01:03:15,312
Wait.
Then why are you here?

933
01:03:15,314 --> 01:03:16,348
We need to get
back to the past

934
01:03:16,350 --> 01:03:18,049
and fix your mess.

935
01:03:18,051 --> 01:03:19,453
And you're gonna help us.

936
01:03:21,555 --> 01:03:23,520
How do we open the Gateway?

937
01:03:23,522 --> 01:03:26,457
No, no, no, no.
The Queen won't like that.

938
01:03:26,459 --> 01:03:28,292
Oh, I don't care!

939
01:03:28,294 --> 01:03:30,229
No!

940
01:03:30,231 --> 01:03:32,129
Shut him up, or
there's gonna be trouble!

941
01:03:32,131 --> 01:03:34,432
Don't you wanna
undo all of this?

942
01:03:34,434 --> 01:03:36,000
Take it back?

943
01:03:36,002 --> 01:03:37,336
You don't understand.

944
01:03:37,338 --> 01:03:40,270
The Queen, she's in my head.

945
01:03:40,272 --> 01:03:41,740
She controls everything.

946
01:03:41,742 --> 01:03:45,379
You just tell me,
is there a way?

947
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:51,018
Yes.

948
01:03:53,586 --> 01:03:57,721
Yes, but she won't be happy.

949
01:03:57,723 --> 01:04:01,558
No, no, you have to go.
You have to leave, or else!

950
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:02,660
Can you do something
about this?

951
01:04:02,662 --> 01:04:04,765
Yes. I was hoping you'd ask.

952
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,801
Oh, thank you.

953
01:04:13,841 --> 01:04:17,575
All this time,
what have I done?

954
01:04:17,577 --> 01:04:19,479
You can shut up now.

955
01:04:22,649 --> 01:04:24,649
Do you know
where the Gateway is?

956
01:04:24,651 --> 01:04:26,453
Do you know how to open it?

957
01:04:28,888 --> 01:04:29,923
You can speak now!

958
01:04:31,390 --> 01:04:35,061
Yes. The power core.

959
01:04:36,497 --> 01:04:38,665
Do you know how to get it?

960
01:04:42,468 --> 01:04:44,200
Then go get it!

961
01:04:44,202 --> 01:04:46,539
And don't get caught.

962
01:04:50,877 --> 01:04:53,877
Go!

963
01:04:53,879 --> 01:04:56,383
- Excuse me.
- Quickly, quietly.

964
01:05:02,156 --> 01:05:03,220
Oh!

965
01:05:17,771 --> 01:05:19,473
Go! Go!

966
01:05:32,919 --> 01:05:34,019
Hatter!

967
01:05:34,021 --> 01:05:38,557
Hatter!
Open this door at once!

968
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,825
How do I know you're you?

969
01:05:40,827 --> 01:05:43,729
How do I know you're you?

970
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:47,732
If I'm not me,
then who would I be?

971
01:05:47,734 --> 01:05:49,968
Hatter, we don't
have time for riddles.

972
01:05:49,970 --> 01:05:52,604
If you believe me,
I'll believe you.

973
01:05:52,606 --> 01:05:54,508
Is that a bargain?

974
01:05:56,575 --> 01:05:58,144
Fair enough.

975
01:06:09,055 --> 01:06:10,488
Have a nice visit?

976
01:06:10,490 --> 01:06:11,656
I'm afraid not.

977
01:06:11,658 --> 01:06:13,591
Is it tea time yet?

978
01:06:13,593 --> 01:06:15,026
The wedding's nearly upon us.

979
01:06:15,028 --> 01:06:16,861
And I think it's time
I had a spot.

980
01:06:16,863 --> 01:06:19,865
No.

981
01:06:19,867 --> 01:06:21,635
Done.

982
01:06:31,879 --> 01:06:33,611
Oh, gosh...

983
01:06:35,582 --> 01:06:37,314
I had a cup of tea earlier,

984
01:06:37,316 --> 01:06:39,584
and I didn't
get too far ahead.

985
01:06:39,586 --> 01:06:42,220
The future then.
Fear not, Hatter.

986
01:06:42,222 --> 01:06:44,622
Surely, we're not too late
to correct it.

987
01:06:44,624 --> 01:06:46,290
I should hope not.

988
01:06:46,292 --> 01:06:47,859
How does it work?

989
01:06:47,861 --> 01:06:49,727
I need to find out where and

990
01:06:49,729 --> 01:06:51,694
when the Avengers wound up.

991
01:06:51,696 --> 01:06:53,397
You just take a sip

992
01:06:53,399 --> 01:06:55,866
and you think of when you want
to be in there, you will go.

993
01:06:55,868 --> 01:06:57,602
Splendid.
A cuppa then.

994
01:06:57,604 --> 01:07:01,207
Oh, wait.
I got it. Please have a seat.

995
01:07:02,341 --> 01:07:03,741
This is very strong stuff.

996
01:07:03,743 --> 01:07:06,678
Well, let's hope so.

997
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:09,080
- Wish me luck.
- Yes.

998
01:07:09,082 --> 01:07:12,986
The future, it is, then.
Ever forward, as they say.

999
01:07:15,888 --> 01:07:19,559
Mm, mm.

1000
01:07:39,479 --> 01:07:41,548
I told you.

1001
01:07:44,051 --> 01:07:46,049
Oh, my!

1002
01:07:46,051 --> 01:07:49,256
It seems we've let
ourselves go, Alice.

1003
01:07:57,664 --> 01:08:00,700
What have they done to
my beautiful building?

1004
01:08:09,443 --> 01:08:11,144
Hello?

1005
01:08:17,550 --> 01:08:19,451
Alice?

1006
01:08:19,453 --> 01:08:21,986
Is that you?

1007
01:08:21,988 --> 01:08:24,956
My dear Prince Charming.

1008
01:08:24,958 --> 01:08:29,626
Forgive my saying so,
but you've aged terribly!

1009
01:08:30,796 --> 01:08:33,098
You're back, Alice.

1010
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:36,367
Magda has my ring.

1011
01:08:36,369 --> 01:08:39,170
Then I've arrived too late.

1012
01:08:39,172 --> 01:08:41,304
That's just it.

1013
01:08:41,306 --> 01:08:44,144
You're right on time.

1014
01:08:45,477 --> 01:08:47,245
He's taking too long!

1015
01:08:47,247 --> 01:08:48,345
Time for Plan B?

1016
01:08:48,347 --> 01:08:49,680
My magic will wear off soon!

1017
01:08:49,682 --> 01:08:52,683
Oh, thank you.

1018
01:08:52,685 --> 01:08:54,352
What about him?

1019
01:08:54,354 --> 01:08:55,819
What about him?
Leave him!

1020
01:08:55,821 --> 01:08:57,855
We could kill him.

1021
01:08:57,857 --> 01:09:02,128
Let him suffer here for
as long as here exists.

1022
01:09:07,333 --> 01:09:10,634
Rumpelstiltskin!

1023
01:09:10,636 --> 01:09:13,403
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

1024
01:09:13,405 --> 01:09:14,705
Come here at once!

1025
01:09:14,707 --> 01:09:16,310
Coming, my Queen!

1026
01:09:28,421 --> 01:09:29,821
Rupert, you're alive!

1027
01:09:29,823 --> 01:09:33,258
Are you here to set me free?

1028
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:34,992
It's about that.

1029
01:09:34,994 --> 01:09:39,130
Sorry, Chuckie.
Magda's got Snow White.

1030
01:09:39,132 --> 01:09:44,234
The only way to get her outta
here is to get you to the altar.

1031
01:09:44,236 --> 01:09:48,839
Congrats, buddy.
You're getting hitched.

1032
01:09:48,841 --> 01:09:51,274
I don't understand.

1033
01:09:51,276 --> 01:09:52,510
If I marry Magda...

1034
01:09:52,512 --> 01:09:55,679
Oh, not Magda!
Snow White.

1035
01:09:55,681 --> 01:09:58,383
But how?

1036
01:09:58,385 --> 01:09:59,683
What about your friend, Alice?

1037
01:09:59,685 --> 01:10:01,018
Forget about Alice.

1038
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:03,854
She's already played her part.

1039
01:10:03,856 --> 01:10:08,826
Trust me, you just need
to walk down the aisle.

1040
01:10:08,828 --> 01:10:11,629
It'll all fall into place.

1041
01:10:11,631 --> 01:10:13,898
Can you hang in there, buddy?

1042
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:16,033
Of course, yes!

1043
01:10:16,035 --> 01:10:17,167
Anything!

1044
01:10:17,169 --> 01:10:19,903
Good.
Now I gotta go.

1045
01:10:19,905 --> 01:10:22,109
I got a part to play, too.

1046
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:26,647
You're a good friend,
Rupert...

1047
01:10:28,848 --> 01:10:30,182
And a hero.

1048
01:10:31,985 --> 01:10:33,820
Anything for love.

1049
01:10:34,988 --> 01:10:37,289
Now it's show time.

1050
01:10:46,165 --> 01:10:49,302
Just gotta get into costume.

1051
01:11:04,449 --> 01:11:07,385
All right.
Coordinates are calibrated.

1052
01:11:07,387 --> 01:11:09,787
Everything is set
as far as I can surmise.

1053
01:11:09,789 --> 01:11:11,488
We just need the power core

1054
01:11:11,490 --> 01:11:12,723
and then we ought to be able
to send the girls back

1055
01:11:12,725 --> 01:11:14,261
just before the wedding.

1056
01:11:16,596 --> 01:11:17,728
Then fire it up.

1057
01:11:17,730 --> 01:11:19,996
Oh, that was careless!

1058
01:11:19,998 --> 01:11:21,099
I thought you were nuts.

1059
01:11:21,101 --> 01:11:23,099
Never proved any harm before.

1060
01:11:23,101 --> 01:11:25,536
In fact, I think it's quite
the asset more oft than not.

1061
01:11:25,538 --> 01:11:27,205
Well, what do you think?
Can you send us back?

1062
01:11:27,207 --> 01:11:29,139
Oh, yes, but with
hardly time to spare.

1063
01:11:29,141 --> 01:11:32,910
We just need to let it
warm up, as it were.

1064
01:11:32,912 --> 01:11:35,979
Ladies? Take your places.

1065
01:11:35,981 --> 01:11:38,950
- Snow...
- Charles?

1066
01:11:38,952 --> 01:11:41,818
I never thought
I'd see you again.

1067
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:43,821
Now that you have
to leave so soon,

1068
01:11:43,823 --> 01:11:46,990
I...
I don't think I can bear it.

1069
01:11:46,992 --> 01:11:51,062
Charles, I promise you.

1070
01:11:51,064 --> 01:11:54,398
When we're finished, we'll
never have to live this life

1071
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:57,304
because you'll have lived
a better one with me.

1072
01:12:01,473 --> 01:12:03,176
Give it a shot!

1073
01:12:08,647 --> 01:12:09,882
Oh!

1074
01:12:14,587 --> 01:12:17,022
Oh, did you not mean me?

1075
01:12:19,592 --> 01:12:21,425
Magda!

1076
01:12:21,427 --> 01:12:24,765
Stop right there!

1077
01:12:27,632 --> 01:12:30,468
When my little Rumpy here
told me what you made him do,

1078
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:34,139
well, I thought I'd just
kill you, but...

1079
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:35,673
Oh!

1080
01:12:35,675 --> 01:12:38,009
This is much more fun.

1081
01:12:38,011 --> 01:12:40,143
I told you we should
have killed him!

1082
01:12:40,145 --> 01:12:42,278
It's what I would have done.

1083
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:43,917
In fact...

1084
01:12:45,452 --> 01:12:47,186
Oh!

1085
01:12:48,587 --> 01:12:53,691
But, my Queen, why?

1086
01:12:53,693 --> 01:12:55,928
I got bored.

1087
01:12:57,931 --> 01:13:00,031
And now I have new playthings.

1088
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:04,033
Oh, the fun we could have.

1089
01:13:04,035 --> 01:13:06,737
Shall I make you
kill your friends here?

1090
01:13:06,739 --> 01:13:10,608
No. Too easy.

1091
01:13:10,610 --> 01:13:13,411
Perhaps I will let you
use the Gateway.

1092
01:13:13,413 --> 01:13:16,580
The Ice Age sounds nice.

1093
01:13:16,582 --> 01:13:21,984
I'm sure you would feel right at
home there, wouldn't you, Snow?

1094
01:13:21,986 --> 01:13:23,787
Listen to yourself.

1095
01:13:23,789 --> 01:13:25,790
Look around you!

1096
01:13:25,792 --> 01:13:27,992
Is this what you wanted?

1097
01:13:27,994 --> 01:13:30,294
A crumbling kingdom?

1098
01:13:30,296 --> 01:13:34,032
Nothing but brainwashed
subjects to do your bidding?

1099
01:13:34,034 --> 01:13:36,834
They don't follow
you out of love.

1100
01:13:36,836 --> 01:13:39,804
You didn't earn any of this!

1101
01:13:39,806 --> 01:13:42,572
Oh, but I did.

1102
01:13:42,574 --> 01:13:46,777
The sheer lengths I went through
in capturing your Charming.

1103
01:13:46,779 --> 01:13:49,447
The long and agonizing years

1104
01:13:49,449 --> 01:13:53,416
I spent twisting him
this way and that.

1105
01:13:53,418 --> 01:13:59,967
Oh, no, this... this has been
a long time coming.

1106
01:14:00,793 --> 01:14:06,863
And now, now I have
everything I've ever wanted.

1107
01:14:06,865 --> 01:14:09,634
But are you happy?

1108
01:14:09,636 --> 01:14:12,036
I'm about to be.

1109
01:14:12,038 --> 01:14:14,272
You had your chance
to be a hero

1110
01:14:14,274 --> 01:14:17,808
and you chose villainy.

1111
01:14:17,810 --> 01:14:20,647
Now you've got another chance.

1112
01:14:23,350 --> 01:14:25,483
I really can't believe it.

1113
01:14:25,485 --> 01:14:29,118
After all this time,
you show up now,

1114
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:31,721
when you have no chance
of stopping me.

1115
01:14:33,124 --> 01:14:37,694
Oh, I wish Charles
were here to see this.

1116
01:14:37,696 --> 01:14:40,630
Be careful what you
wish for, Magda.

1117
01:14:40,632 --> 01:14:42,499
Charles?

1118
01:14:42,501 --> 01:14:47,871
Oh, Charles, how long has
it been since the wedding?

1119
01:14:47,873 --> 01:14:50,407
Too long.

1120
01:14:50,409 --> 01:14:54,144
Your reign of terror ends today.

1121
01:14:54,146 --> 01:14:57,148
I know I can't tell
you what to do.

1122
01:14:57,150 --> 01:14:59,750
But I would really rather
not kill an old man.

1123
01:14:59,752 --> 01:15:03,787
I'd rather die than
stomach another day with you.

1124
01:15:03,789 --> 01:15:05,257
If you say so.

1125
01:15:06,993 --> 01:15:09,693
Now, Rupert!

1126
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:10,727
No!

1127
01:15:13,966 --> 01:15:17,268
Send... them... back!

1128
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:19,439
Goodbye, Charles.

1129
01:15:24,644 --> 01:15:26,713
No!

1130
01:15:36,288 --> 01:15:39,590
Charles, you made it.

1131
01:15:39,592 --> 01:15:42,193
And you look so handsome.

1132
01:15:42,195 --> 01:15:46,095
What now?
We say our vows?

1133
01:15:46,097 --> 01:15:48,068
Something like that.

1134
01:15:57,510 --> 01:16:01,644
Be a good Prince,
and marry me...

1135
01:16:01,646 --> 01:16:03,548
Now.

1136
01:16:03,550 --> 01:16:06,986
Or I vow...

1137
01:16:09,154 --> 01:16:10,689
To kill her.

1138
01:16:22,569 --> 01:16:23,600
Oh, no!

1139
01:16:23,602 --> 01:16:28,205
Oh! Thank heavens!

1140
01:16:28,207 --> 01:16:30,640
Did you find them?

1141
01:16:30,642 --> 01:16:32,544
Yes and no.

1142
01:16:37,283 --> 01:16:39,183
What now, then?

1143
01:16:39,185 --> 01:16:44,089
Well, I've got
a wedding to crash.

1144
01:16:47,993 --> 01:16:49,794
Motivate him!

1145
01:16:49,796 --> 01:16:50,995
Wait!

1146
01:16:50,997 --> 01:16:54,264
Wait! Wait!

1147
01:16:54,266 --> 01:16:57,835
If I marry you,

1148
01:16:57,837 --> 01:17:00,004
promise to let her live.

1149
01:17:00,006 --> 01:17:02,508
If you're a good boy.

1150
01:17:21,961 --> 01:17:23,195
Snowy!

1151
01:17:26,199 --> 01:17:27,798
Snowy.

1152
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:31,268
Get your scaly ass
away from my man!

1153
01:17:31,270 --> 01:17:33,105
Kill them!

1154
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:37,241
You don't deserve him!

1155
01:17:37,243 --> 01:17:39,646
"Fairest in all the land"!

1156
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:57,230
He's marrying me!

1157
01:18:02,068 --> 01:18:05,268
Come on, Chuck, now!
Do it now!

1158
01:18:05,270 --> 01:18:07,574
Chuck? Snowy.

1159
01:18:12,477 --> 01:18:15,778
It's me, Charles!
We have to hurry!

1160
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:18,784
Don't listen to her!
That's Rumpelstiltskin!

1161
01:18:20,453 --> 01:18:22,622
Oh, for the love of...

1162
01:18:26,359 --> 01:18:29,827
Snowy... Rupert?

1163
01:18:29,829 --> 01:18:31,728
Oh, now, Chuckie,
I can explain.

1164
01:18:31,730 --> 01:18:33,466
It's kind of funny.
I don't...

1165
01:18:48,580 --> 01:18:50,147
You're getting better at this!

1166
01:18:50,149 --> 01:18:51,885
Well, practice
makes perfect!

1167
01:19:01,593 --> 01:19:02,628
Snow?

1168
01:19:06,798 --> 01:19:08,898
Will you marry me?

1169
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:10,336
It's about time.

1170
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:16,442
Get away from him!

1171
01:19:33,626 --> 01:19:34,825
No!

1172
01:19:34,827 --> 01:19:37,262
If I can't have you,
no one can!

1173
01:19:41,365 --> 01:19:43,032
Stronger than you look!

1174
01:19:43,034 --> 01:19:44,300
Fight me or die!

1175
01:19:44,302 --> 01:19:45,671
I can't hit a woman!

1176
01:19:47,539 --> 01:19:49,242
I can.

1177
01:19:53,412 --> 01:19:57,516
Destroy the city!
Leave nothing standing!

1178
01:20:30,449 --> 01:20:32,515
Mermen are drying up,
fish face.

1179
01:20:32,517 --> 01:20:34,218
If I were you, I'd quit.

1180
01:20:34,220 --> 01:20:37,624
Now get the hell off my land!

1181
01:21:17,797 --> 01:21:19,996
You lied to me.

1182
01:21:19,998 --> 01:21:21,730
Magda...

1183
01:21:21,732 --> 01:21:24,367
You were trying to get him
to marry you all along.

1184
01:21:24,369 --> 01:21:26,737
You tried to trick him!

1185
01:21:26,739 --> 01:21:30,474
Magda, no, that's ridiculous.

1186
01:21:30,476 --> 01:21:33,542
You tried to trick me.

1187
01:21:33,544 --> 01:21:35,645
You ruined my wedding!

1188
01:21:35,647 --> 01:21:38,148
No! They ruined your wedding!

1189
01:21:38,150 --> 01:21:40,082
I was just here to help.

1190
01:21:40,084 --> 01:21:41,917
What was it you said
you wanted again?

1191
01:21:41,919 --> 01:21:43,687
Oh, you know what?
I'm good.

1192
01:21:43,689 --> 01:21:45,221
Let's just call it even.

1193
01:21:45,223 --> 01:21:47,758
That's right.
Atlantis.

1194
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:52,028
I'll bring you to Atlantis,
but just be warned.

1195
01:21:52,030 --> 01:21:55,700
Once you see it,
you may never want to leave.

1196
01:21:55,702 --> 01:21:56,899
No!

1197
01:21:56,901 --> 01:22:00,603
Come along, men.
Time to go home.

1198
01:22:00,605 --> 01:22:02,339
No, no, no, please!

1199
01:22:02,341 --> 01:22:04,541
No, I beg you!
No! I can't swim!

1200
01:22:05,543 --> 01:22:06,943
No, Magda! No!

1201
01:22:06,945 --> 01:22:09,478
Please let me go!
Let me just stay here!

1202
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:12,584
Please!
I hate the ocean!

1203
01:22:19,324 --> 01:22:21,627
You may kiss the bride.

1204
01:22:31,337 --> 01:22:33,406
Yeah, that's never
gonna happen.

1205
01:22:34,707 --> 01:22:36,642
I still don't see it.

1206
01:22:37,610 --> 01:22:39,410
Lovely ceremony.

1207
01:22:39,412 --> 01:22:42,511
But after battling
an army of Mermen,

1208
01:22:42,513 --> 01:22:44,148
chasing you through time

1209
01:22:44,150 --> 01:22:46,483
and living through
my own future death,

1210
01:22:46,485 --> 01:22:49,652
I've had just about
enough of the ocean.

1211
01:22:49,654 --> 01:22:52,755
I'll never eat seafood again.

1212
01:22:52,757 --> 01:22:54,992
So what now?
Are you gonna send us back?

1213
01:22:54,994 --> 01:22:59,162
Well, I don't suppose you have
to do anything I say, do you?

1214
01:22:59,164 --> 01:23:01,432
What with ruling all the land.

1215
01:23:01,434 --> 01:23:03,466
I know that's not
how it works here.

1216
01:23:03,468 --> 01:23:06,170
You don't have to worry about me
trying to take over the world.

1217
01:23:06,172 --> 01:23:07,970
Of course not.

1218
01:23:07,972 --> 01:23:09,973
It's already yours,
if I understand correctly.

1219
01:23:09,975 --> 01:23:13,277
Trust me.
We don't see it that way.

1220
01:23:13,279 --> 01:23:14,777
Splendid.

1221
01:23:14,779 --> 01:23:16,580
I think our adventure days
are over.

1222
01:23:16,582 --> 01:23:18,014
Oh, tsk.

1223
01:23:18,016 --> 01:23:20,584
Let's not be so certain
of that, Charles.

1224
01:23:20,586 --> 01:23:22,719
After all, the sea
isn't the only place

1225
01:23:22,721 --> 01:23:24,755
where hidden dangers lurk.

1226
01:23:24,757 --> 01:23:28,191
Believe you me, there's a
whole universe of wonder

1227
01:23:28,193 --> 01:23:31,227
waiting to seep through
the cracks of reality.

1228
01:23:31,229 --> 01:23:33,663
And no doubt we've got quite
a mess to clean up after

1229
01:23:33,665 --> 01:23:37,233
all that pesky time
travel business.

1230
01:23:37,235 --> 01:23:38,902
- We?
- Oh, yes!

1231
01:23:38,904 --> 01:23:42,475
Let's not forget who caused this
mess in the first place, hmm?

1232
01:23:43,609 --> 01:23:46,443
It would only be polite
to help clean it up.

1233
01:23:46,445 --> 01:23:48,178
If you're going
to stick around,

1234
01:23:48,180 --> 01:23:51,281
we'll need to make our little
alliance a tad more official.

1235
01:23:51,283 --> 01:23:56,187
So enjoy the honeymoon.
You certainly earned it.

1236
01:23:56,189 --> 01:23:59,089
But when you return,
I'll expect you

1237
01:23:59,091 --> 01:24:02,829
to report promptly to
Looking Glass, all of you.

1238
01:24:05,897 --> 01:24:09,500
If you call, we'll be there.

1239
01:24:09,502 --> 01:24:10,700
Splendid.

1240
01:24:10,702 --> 01:24:11,867
I've a number of matters

1241
01:24:11,869 --> 01:24:13,194
that I'm sure will require

1242
01:24:13,196 --> 01:24:15,532
the attention of
the Avengers Grimm.

1243
01:24:26,128 --> 01:24:31,128
