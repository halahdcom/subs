00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,362
My name
is Michael Sullivan

3
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:58,073
and I have a story I think
you're gonna wanna hear.

4
00:03:02,723 --> 00:03:04,256
Michael Sullivan?

5
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:20,697
How long have you been in the
lobbyist at Belasquian Banks?

6
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:22,240
Uh, two years.

7
00:03:22,242 --> 00:03:24,827
A lot of strategy,
research and support.

8
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,453
Hmm.

9
00:03:26,455 --> 00:03:27,704
That's a good job.

10
00:03:27,706 --> 00:03:29,624
You're not
happy there?

11
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:33,669
No, I just... I don't want to wake
up when I'm forty and discover

12
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:36,422
the only thing I've contributed
to the world is tax shelters,

13
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:39,299
sweatshops and
holes in the ozone.

14
00:03:39,301 --> 00:03:40,844
You're an idealist?

15
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,887
You know for as long
as I can remember

16
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:46,516
I've wanted to
be a diplomat.

17
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,853
I want to make a
difference in the world.

18
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,399
Your father
was a diplomat.

19
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,526
Uh, yeah, U.S.
State Department, he...

20
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:00,448
Lebanon. 1983.

21
00:04:02,866 --> 00:04:04,491
I'm sorry
for your loss.

22
00:04:08,664 --> 00:04:10,790
My father passed
away when I was little.

23
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:16,461
He was killed in the bombing
of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut

24
00:04:16,463 --> 00:04:17,964
when I
was 5 years old.

25
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:23,301
One of my earliest memories
is my father telling stories

26
00:04:23,303 --> 00:04:24,887
about the founding
of the United Nations.

27
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,475
We'll find a
way to end war.

28
00:04:27,766 --> 00:04:29,726
Made it sound
like modern day Knights

29
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,394
sitting around
the Round Table.

30
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:40,820
I wanted to follow
in his footsteps.

31
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,613
By the fall of 2002
I had applied for a job

32
00:04:43,615 --> 00:04:45,699
at the United
Nations four times.

33
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:47,409
Hey!

34
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:48,536
Uncle Michael!

35
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:49,495
My sister says it's
because Foreign Service

36
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:50,704
is in
our family legacy.

37
00:04:50,706 --> 00:04:52,457
Hey little brother,
how are ya?

38
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,498
Hey, good.
Sorry I'm late.

39
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,375
You look good.

40
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,918
And just
like my mother,

41
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,378
she married a guy she met
while interning at the U.N.

42
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,921
So I got you
something small,

43
00:04:59,923 --> 00:05:01,966
but something else is
on it's way, okay?

44
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,009
Hey, Trevor.

45
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,093
Hey.

46
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,719
Nice cake Lily,
got enough Danish flags?

47
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:07,137
Yeah, yeah.

48
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,514
Well, did you
hear anything?

49
00:05:09,516 --> 00:05:10,974
Uh, no.

50
00:05:10,976 --> 00:05:12,601
I'll hear tomorrow.

51
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,603
But how'd it feel?

52
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:15,855
Good?

53
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,815
No, I was
too nervous.

54
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,942
Oh well,
it's their loss.

55
00:05:20,944 --> 00:05:24,029
I'm sure you'll get it, you've
been working so hard for this!

56
00:05:24,031 --> 00:05:25,615
Yeah.

57
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,784
And it's somebody's
birthday, so should we do cake?

58
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:28,743
Yes!

59
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:32,079
♪ Happy Birthday
to you! ♪

60
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:35,625

61
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:38,795
♪ Happy birthday

62
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,476
Best candidates
keep getting hired away

63
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:56,187
by fucking hedge funds.

64
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,647
Michael Sullivan.

65
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,569
I knew his father.

66
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,199
Danish passport.

67
00:06:07,574 --> 00:06:11,704
His mother's side,
but he's only 24 years old.

68
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:15,666
He'll do.

69
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:27,135
I thought I would start with
some entry-level assignment,

70
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:29,055
instead I got
a dream job.

71
00:06:30,514 --> 00:06:33,517
Special assistant to the
under secretary general.

72
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,685
Running the largest
humanitarian program

73
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,646
in the
United Nations history.

74
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,530
I couldn't
believe my luck.

75
00:06:46,613 --> 00:06:49,950
All I kept thinking
was, "Don't fuck this up."

76
00:06:50,617 --> 00:06:53,243
The program is
called, "Oil For Food."

77
00:06:53,245 --> 00:06:55,079
It's created in 1995.

78
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,291
By Security Council
resolution 986,

79
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:01,084
which has stated that the
UN would manage the sale

80
00:07:01,086 --> 00:07:05,339
of Iraqi oil and use the profits
to provide humanitarian relief

81
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,925
in the country to
alleviate the hardship.

82
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,926
Which basically
means that our office

83
00:07:09,928 --> 00:07:12,512
is in charge of
trying to feed an entire nation,

84
00:07:12,514 --> 00:07:14,558
over 20 million people.

85
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,441
You have a little
reading to catch up on.

86
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,692
We are woefully behind schedule
on our funding status report

87
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,860
to the
Security Council;

88
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,570
Your immediate task will be to
help facilitate its completion.

89
00:07:28,572 --> 00:07:30,281
Your predecessor
was due to brief

90
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,656
the undersecretary
tomorrow.

91
00:07:31,658 --> 00:07:33,159
Tomorrow?

92
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,284
What happened to him?

93
00:07:34,286 --> 00:07:36,121
A car accident in Iraq.

94
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:51,094
Jesus Christ!

95
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:52,094
Is he alright?

96
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:53,680
No,
he didn't make it.

97
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,889
A bullet-point
summary will do.

98
00:07:55,891 --> 00:07:57,974
Pasha will be in
his office at nine.

99
00:08:34,221 --> 00:08:36,723
Got a couple
of minutes, Michael?

100
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:39,142
Justin Cutter,
Central Intelligence.

101
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,475
Really?

102
00:08:40,477 --> 00:08:43,438
Yeah, we come in
all shapes and sizes.

103
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,772
Okay, can I help
you with something?

104
00:08:45,774 --> 00:08:49,776
Listen, we think Oil for Food is
being gamed for private gain

105
00:08:49,778 --> 00:08:52,405
by a bad guy or
bad guys unknown.

106
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,364
Possibly with help
from the inside,

107
00:08:54,366 --> 00:08:56,408
which is where
you are, so...

108
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,076
Look I-I just
got this job.

109
00:08:58,078 --> 00:09:00,371
I'm not gonna-
I'm not gonna spy for you.

110
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,580
Oh God, no.

111
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,583
No, no, leave that to
the professionals.

112
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:05,292
I don't want
you to do anything

113
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:08,212
that makes you
uncomfortable, Michael.

114
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,757
Just keep your eyes and
ears open, that's all.

115
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,009
For God and Country.

116
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:22,517
I was aware going in
that the Oil for Food program

117
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:25,648
had become something
of a political football.

118
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:30,984
The program budget was
10 billon dollars a year.

119
00:09:30,986 --> 00:09:34,781
The entire rest of the UN
operational budget was only two.

120
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,784
There was crazy
money to be had.

121
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:41,536
Special interest
circling like buzzards.

122
00:09:41,538 --> 00:09:43,289
The program was simple.

123
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,041
Because of the
economic sanctions imposed

124
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,584
against Saddam Hussein

125
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:50,504
after the first Gulf War,
Iraq's economy had crashed.

126
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,422
People were
starving and dying

127
00:09:52,424 --> 00:09:56,009
from lack of basic
medicine and staples.

128
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:58,304
The Oil for Food program
was designed to provide

129
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:02,016
Iraqi citizens with what
they needed to survive.

130
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,060
While at the same time,
preventing Saddam

131
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:06,938
from developing his alleged
weapons of mass destruction.

132
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,483
Under UN supervision,

133
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,276
Iraqi oil was being sold
at market prices

134
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:15,365
to pay
for humanitarian aid.

135
00:10:16,448 --> 00:10:20,033
Our job was to keep it funded
by making sure everything

136
00:10:20,035 --> 00:10:21,453
went by the book.

137
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,122
I'm here to
present the summary.

138
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,873
He'll be with
you in a minute.

139
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,916
...This fucking
regime!

140
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,042
Unbelievable.

141
00:10:29,044 --> 00:10:32,546
Yes, I sorted it as
always, a solution.

142
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:35,590
Now we-we charted
a load of taxis, filled them,

143
00:10:35,592 --> 00:10:37,509
that should last
the outlying villages

144
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,054
till we get
the trucks back.

145
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,475
You call
this a summary?

146
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,603
Fucking war and peace.

147
00:10:48,605 --> 00:10:50,605
Sorry sir, I was
trying to be thorough.

148
00:10:50,607 --> 00:10:52,150
Thorough?

149
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,943
Yes, sir.

150
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:56,487
Fuck.

151
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,281
Well, just give me
the highlights kid,

152
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,199
otherwise we'll be
here till spring thaw.

153
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:03,536
Yes we have uhh, decreased
the malnutrition rate,

154
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:06,830
reduced child mortality,
we've also uhh,

155
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:11,502
made big strides in access
to water and electricity.

156
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,588
There are
however some umm,

157
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,340
systemic distribution failures
particularly in the North.

158
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:21,304
The Kurds are getting shorted
uhh, wheat, milk, diesel fuel

159
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:24,515
to the benefit of Tikrit,
who are getting seemingly

160
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,724
more than
their fair share.

161
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:28,935
Saddam's hometown,
what a surprise?

162
00:11:28,937 --> 00:11:30,188
Yeah.

163
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,982
There are also all these
after service fees uhh,

164
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:35,193
in the contracts.

165
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,027
I'm pretty sure
they're kick-backs.

166
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:40,156
If you wanna take a look, I uhh,
highlighted and aggregated them

167
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,951
on page 26 to 29.

168
00:11:51,251 --> 00:11:53,002
It's a lot
of money, sir.

169
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:56,548
In some places it's
as much as 30 percent.

170
00:12:02,971 --> 00:12:04,638
Sit.

171
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,557
Kid.

172
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:08,727
Sit down.

173
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:13,772
The first rule of
diplomacy is that

174
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,775
the truth is not
a matter of fact,

175
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:18,026
it's a matter of consensus,
now consensus right now

176
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,778
is that
sanctions are here to stay.

177
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,031
The Americans and The
British will never lift them,

178
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:26,661
which means that if you want
the people of Iraq to survive,

179
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,787
we have to keep
Oil for Food running.

180
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,580
Even with all
it's warts and flaws.

181
00:12:30,582 --> 00:12:31,999
Sir, you do
not need to...

182
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,877
The second rule is to keep
your mouth shut and listen.

183
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,628
Then if it suits,
you can talk.

184
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,839
With discretion.

185
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:41,469
Otherwise, keep your
cards, close to your vest.

186
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:44,096
Yeah.

187
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:55,605
Your father
was a good man.

188
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:01,695
You should be so lucky
as to have his heart.

189
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,323
Yeah, so
I've been told.

190
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:07,826
We crossed paths
a couple of times.

191
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:11,750
Must have
been 79', 80'.

192
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,835
What a tragedy.

193
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,629
Beirut.

194
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:21,759
Fuck, I'm sorry.

195
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:27,472
That must have been hard, a
boy growing up without a father.

196
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,056
It was my normal.

197
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,559
I had my cry.

198
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:40,693
Good.

199
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,570
Fix your summary.

200
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,530
Go home and pack.

201
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,991
We leave for
Baghdad on the red-eye.

202
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:47,949
Uhh...

203
00:13:47,951 --> 00:13:50,953
What?
You have other plans?

204
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,873
No, I don't.

205
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:54,916
Of course not.

206
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:56,041
Thank you.

207
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,705
I was swept up
in the romance of it,

208
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,833
I mean,
this is what I wanted.

209
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:39,504
High adventure
and a worthy cause.

210
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:43,341
It's like
Baghdad was my Casablanca.

211
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:49,177
More or less sketchy,
crazy dangerous and stranger

212
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,848
than I could've
ever imagined.

213
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:55,727
The country lived in a state
of permanent self-occupation.

214
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:59,188
Our Baghdad office is
going to present a problem.

215
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,522
Okay.

216
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:03,026
We can't let this
director sabotage the report.

217
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:05,027
Why-why would he
sabotage his own report?

218
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,653
She.

219
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,739
So the Security Council will be
forced to lift the sanctions,

220
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,993
and everybody can cash in on the
deals they made with Saddam back

221
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:15,831
before he rolled into
Kuwait and pissed off the world.

222
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,041
Jesus H. Christ, kid.

223
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,045
Gonna have to fucking teach
you everything from scratch.

224
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:26,965
Every six months we have to
justify our continued existence.

225
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:30,636
Our job right now is to write a
report for the Security Council

226
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:34,556
emphasizing all the good in
the Oil for Food program

227
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:37,560
whilst minimizing
the challenges.

228
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:39,145
Not to lie.

229
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:41,064
No, never lie,

230
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:47,820
but to choose our facts or
truths with the utmost care.

231
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:48,988
Right.

232
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:54,079
Can I trust you
to do that?

233
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,250
Yes. Absolutely.

234
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,068
There she is.

235
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,945
Madame Dupre.

236
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:30,990
Trying to backstab us.

237
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,701
Christina.

238
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,248
Hassan Ghazarian.

239
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,206
Hey, Michael Sullivan.

240
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,208
Nice to meet you.

241
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,209
Nice to meet you.

242
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,839
Did you get the
documents I sent you?

243
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,092
I did, I've even
printed them up for you.

244
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:52,343
Oh great.

245
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:53,930
You write well.

246
00:16:56,765 --> 00:17:00,892
60 percent of the Iraqi
people are solely dependent

247
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:04,146
upon our
suppliers for survival.

248
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:08,234
Wheat, grain, milk, medicine,
essential infrastructure.

249
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:11,988
During our last ten months, we
have decreased malnutrition rate

250
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:15,240
amongst children
in Iraq by 50 percent,

251
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:20,287
thereby reduced
child mortality significantly.

252
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,789
Okay, thank you very much,
photographers come through.

253
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,375
We're gonna have a photo
opportunity with Madame Dupre.

254
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,797
It's hard to
overstate how badly Saddam

255
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,760
was abusing
his people.

256
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:36,345
Friends of the regime could
get easy access to the medicine.

257
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:39,265
Others less fortunate
were left to die

258
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:41,351
from even the
simplest of diseases.

259
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,149
They send bad drugs.

260
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,986
Dump on us their
out-of-date prescriptions.

261
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:54,113
Thank him for uhh,
bringing this to me

262
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:56,365
and tell him I will
definitely look into it.

263
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:04,332
He says there's at black
market with Oil for Food pills.

264
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:16,302
Or this innocent child: Please
explain to her why she cannot

265
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:20,055
have the stem cell
therapy that could cure her.

266
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:23,392
Why she has to suffer because
the West begrudges Iraq,

267
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,312
it's dignity.

268
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,526
That I can't
explain, no.

269
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,374
She asks
why you are crying?

270
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:04,392
I promise I will do anything
I can to help your child.

271
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,202
It sickens me to have to stand
there and listen to your lies.

272
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:28,790
It's P.R., Christina, everyone
in the field is working so hard.

273
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,500
Well, my reporter for
The Security Council

274
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,504
is going to
tell the truth.

275
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:34,632
Just so you know.

276
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,093
Your report.

277
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:41,094
The program
is a failure.

278
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,138
The sanctions
aren't working.

279
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,430
How is the
program failing?

280
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,474
Medicine is
getting through!

281
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:45,475
At what cost!?

282
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:46,517
People are
getting basic staples.

283
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,143
At what cost?

284
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,438
Everybody is
grifting the system.

285
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,230
Corruption grows
like a cancer.

286
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,607
It'll never be
perfect and surely,

287
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,736
it's better than
doing nothing.

288
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:58,446
Michael,
what's the delay?

289
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:00,448
Uhh, sorry, there's a
small security issue.

290
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,824
We'll be on our way
in a few moments.

291
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:05,702
I know
what you're doing.

292
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,331
You want me to sign off
on your moral relativism

293
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:11,417
so you can throw me under
the bus when it all unravels.

294
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,251
You are mistaken.

295
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,711
I'm just trying
to feed a country.

296
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,756
Enough spin,
Costa, enough!

297
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:18,507
The facts will
speak for themselves.

298
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,301
My report with
The Security Council

299
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:21,844
is going to
tell the truth.

300
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,504
Baghdad is the centre
of the universe now, kid.

301
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:59,673
And this,
Al Rasheed is ground zero.

302
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,008
Boiler room of diplomacy.

303
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,354
Pasha!

304
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,356
Nice to see you again.

305
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:19,360
Mr. Mohammed,
my assistant.

306
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:20,819
Michael Sullivan.

307
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,529
Count your fingers after you
shake hands with this one.

308
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,365
All major intelligence
agencies are here,

309
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,535
and all
rooms are bugged.

310
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:29,036
Everyone trying
to barter in their secrets

311
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:30,537
and their services.

312
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:36,544
Information is everything;
the currency, the power.

313
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:39,046
Look. Listen. Learn.

314
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,135
Everyone has their
own agenda, huh?

315
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:48,597
Baby Bush thinks Saddam
disrespected his papa.

316
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,182
American neocons?

317
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:53,061
They're convinced democracy will
bloom here like a fucking flower

318
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:54,644
...good luck with that.

319
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,565
Putin wants Bush to fail,
China wants the new markets,

320
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:59,025
half of Europe
couldn't care less

321
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:01,943
whether Saddam gasses
civilians or builds a bomb

322
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:05,448
Big Oil simply wants
an end to the sanctions

323
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,327
so they can
suck at the Iraqi teat.

324
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:14,959
So, about what the
doctor told me today.

325
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:20,630
The grifted medicine,
missing supplies.

326
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:22,006
I smell a setup.

327
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:23,882
It didn't really
feel like a setup.

328
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,426
More nonsense
from Madame.

329
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:28,179
She's not just ineffective,
she's actively inventing proof

330
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:29,721
of the
program's failings.

331
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:32,600
If we don't do something, this
reports gonna be a disaster.

332
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:34,227
Don't you
get the final say?

333
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:36,645
Sadly, no.

334
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:41,484
UN protocol requires the
regional director sign off

335
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:44,821
on the report.

336
00:22:44,823 --> 00:22:46,698
And what's our agenda?

337
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,824
Our agenda?

338
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:51,119
That little girl.

339
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:53,496
At the hospital.

340
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:57,208
God help anyone
who gets in our way.

341
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,459
Yeah.

342
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,604
I had a son once.

343
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:23,611
Died of
the flu, just a baby.

344
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,031
Can you
believe that?

345
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:34,663
And my wife, we
couldn't make another.

346
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:38,625
Sorry.

347
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:40,961
Thirty years ago.

348
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:43,965
How did you put it?

349
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:46,884
I had my cry.

350
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:51,890
Flu.

351
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:56,894
You tired?

352
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,105
No.

353
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:00,645
Youth.

354
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:01,940
Fuck.

355
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:18,664
You know, for someone who speaks
for other people for a living,

356
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,084
you don't talk much.

357
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:26,672
I couldn't help but notice
you were not surprised

358
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:29,677
when the doctor spoke of
black market medicine.

359
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:32,303
No I wasn't.

360
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:35,808
Will you
tell your boss?

361
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:41,562
Yeah, we already know there's
some corruption in the program.

362
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:44,315
Outside Baghdad
it's much worse.

363
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:47,110
Rations diverted,
power cut off.

364
00:24:47,112 --> 00:24:48,779
Extortion, bribes.

365
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:54,786
I'll uhh, make sure
Pasha knows that too.

366
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:09,341
You have something
you want to ask me?

367
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,927
Is it
about Madame?

368
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:15,595
That your boss wants you
to find the secret button

369
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:18,350
he can push to bend
her to his will?

370
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:23,729
I can tell you:
it does not exist.

371
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:25,482
I'm just trying
to do my job.

372
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:39,873
But your
predecessor Abhek...

373
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,043
His car accident was
not an accident.

374
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:51,091
That's a pretty big
accusation to make.

375
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:14,865
Why are you
telling me this?

376
00:26:16,284 --> 00:26:19,037
He was murdered because
of something he uncovered.

377
00:26:19,871 --> 00:26:22,205
Something in
Oil for Food?

378
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:24,207
I don't know.

379
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:25,250
Maybe.

380
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:30,212
He was fearful of
someone inside United Nations.

381
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:32,424
A facilitator
of corruption.

382
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,221
You need to be
very, very careful.

383
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:20,138
Good evening.

384
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,389
Please.

385
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:32,482
The Mukhabarat, you see,
were concerned to inspect

386
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,276
your sleeping chambers
for the existence

387
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:36,071
of any
surveillance device.

388
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:40,158
This as a courtesy, for
your security, of course.

389
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,076
Why don't you start by
telling me who you are?

390
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,621
Are you enjoying your visit
to Mesopotamia, Mr. Sullivan?

391
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:49,083
First one,
if I'm not mistaken yes?

392
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:52,378
Such a difficult, stressful
time for everyone here.

393
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,796
The Great Satan keeps
threatening to bomb the city

394
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:58,343
meanwhile, the
sanctions cut deep.

395
00:27:58,345 --> 00:27:59,344
Baghdad puts...

396
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:01,013
Why don't you
get to the point?

397
00:28:03,641 --> 00:28:05,725
You will find on
the bureau behind me

398
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:08,353
an envelope containing
a small honorarium.

399
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:11,146
We greatly admire the work you
are doing for the Iraqi...

400
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:12,648
It's late.

401
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,844
I'd like you
to leave, please.

402
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:27,037
No disrespect
was meant by it.

403
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,891
Don't forget your envelope.

404
00:28:57,487 --> 00:29:00,363
Can't blame them for
trying, it's nothing.

405
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:01,700
You handled it perfectly.

406
00:29:05,036 --> 00:29:08,456
What about what the
interpreter said about Abhek?

407
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:11,209
I don't believe it.

408
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:15,587
Maybe she's a spy for
Saddam sent to rattle us.

409
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:19,507
You look
like shit, kid.

410
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:22,095
Fuck,
eat something.

411
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:36,815
I'm sorry.

412
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:40,652
Excuse me?

413
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:45,408
I'd been warned,
but I was still shocked

414
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:48,288
by the criticism from UN staff
against the sanctions.

415
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:52,289
Pasha was right, every
department had an agenda.

416
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:54,292
They were working
across purposes.

417
00:29:54,294 --> 00:29:58,755
They played right into
Madame Dupre's hands.

418
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:09,306
Shut up!

419
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:13,438
You sound like
Saddam's puppets all of you.

420
00:30:14,064 --> 00:30:16,521
Do I need to point out the
serious fucking consequences

421
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,607
to the Iraqi people,
if we fail to continue...

422
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:19,441
You violated...

423
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:24,447
Are you
fucking kidding me!?

424
00:30:24,449 --> 00:30:26,449
It's not our place
to question the decisions

425
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:30,952
of The Security Council.

426
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:32,456
We implement them.

427
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:38,335
Absent of
all politics.

428
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:41,924
And yes, it's a hard
fucking job sometimes.

429
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:45,759
But if
you can't do it,

430
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:48,972
I suggest you turn in your
fucking credentials and go home.

431
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:01,942
I knew
from my research

432
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:04,778
that our biggest worry
was Kurdistan.

433
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,699
As long as Saddam was
in power it was gonna take

434
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:10,075
all of Pasha's considerable
diplomatic skills

435
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:13,121
to keep the Kurd's from
undermining the report.

436
00:31:13,123 --> 00:31:18,543
The rations, when they come, are
always half what was promised.

437
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:20,795
The North is a protectorate,
so unfortunately...

438
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:23,171
They had been hurt
harder under the sanctions

439
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:26,008
than any other region
and while Oil for Food

440
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:28,510
was providing
some relief,

441
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,971
it had helped sustain the very
regime that oppressed them.

442
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:34,142
The Kurds have plenty
of money to buy their own food,

443
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,809
from that
black market oil.

444
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:37,144
Minister, if you
would allow me...

445
00:31:37,146 --> 00:31:39,188
The Kurdish
conflict with Iraq goes back

446
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:41,026
nearly a century.

447
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:44,651
Saddam Hussein took
it to a whole new level.

448
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:47,988
Forced displacement,
mass detention and torture.

449
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:51,074
And then, when that didn't work,
he resorted to landmines

450
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:53,119
and cluster bombs,
sarin gas

451
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:55,037
and nerve agents Killing
tens of thousands

452
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,165
and crippling tens of
thousands more.

453
00:31:58,167 --> 00:32:00,125
A reign of
terror that included

454
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:02,879
the worst single act of chemical
genocide ever committed

455
00:32:02,881 --> 00:32:04,963
against a
civilian population.

456
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:08,676
Kurds are dying for
simply being Kurdish.

457
00:32:08,678 --> 00:32:10,553
And in a shuttle
diplomacy between

458
00:32:10,555 --> 00:32:14,140
two sworn enemies,
I watched Pasha work his magic.

459
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:17,267
...About how the
most beloved food to Allah,

460
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:20,438
is that which is touched
by many hands.

461
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,271
Fuck!

462
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,315
This is all I need.

463
00:32:22,317 --> 00:32:23,607
The Kurdish Minister's
right though,

464
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:24,901
from what
I've been told,

465
00:32:24,903 --> 00:32:25,901
they're getting
completely screwed.

466
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:27,569
I know he's right.

467
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:30,698
It's in the fucking field reports,
but we have to keep a lid on it.

468
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,241
The choice can't be to
feed everyone or feed no one.

469
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:37,162
It has to be to feed
as many as possible.

470
00:32:41,211 --> 00:32:44,003
I have to go back to
New York tomorrow.

471
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:46,171
I need you
to stay focused.

472
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:47,008
Of course.

473
00:32:48,926 --> 00:32:50,176
Here's your
travel itinerary.

474
00:32:50,178 --> 00:32:53,723
You are connected to
Kuwait, you land in JFK at 5 PM.

475
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:59,267
Dupre is going to freeze
you out for the final report.

476
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:01,230
Her opus
indictment of Oil for Food.

477
00:33:03,942 --> 00:33:08,151
Okay, then why am
I staying here then?

478
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:10,196
In a few days, you'll
receive some photographs.

479
00:33:10,198 --> 00:33:12,030
You'll want
Hassan to see them

480
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:14,074
because you won't understand
what they could mean.

481
00:33:14,076 --> 00:33:17,161
Your task is to make sure
he shows them to Dupre

482
00:33:17,163 --> 00:33:18,832
by insisting
he shouldn't.

483
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,709
You're asking
me if I'll...

484
00:33:22,711 --> 00:33:23,918
A trap, yes.

485
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,254
She'll fall into it,
and we'll be rid of her.

486
00:33:30,218 --> 00:33:33,219
Kid,
it's diplomacy,

487
00:33:33,221 --> 00:33:36,180
which sometimes requires
removing obstacles

488
00:33:36,182 --> 00:33:38,018
that stand in the way of
successful outcome.

489
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,274
Can I trust you
again with this one?

490
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:49,861
I mean, how big of a lie
am I gonna be telling?

491
00:33:49,863 --> 00:33:50,864
Not lie.

492
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:55,451
Just the opportunity to
draw a wrong conclusion.

493
00:34:16,347 --> 00:34:17,353
Morning.

494
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:39,911
Just so you know, Madame says
you won't be reading the report

495
00:34:39,913 --> 00:34:43,206
until it's finished
and she sign off on it.

496
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:45,166
Well, Pasha said he
wants me to help.

497
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:47,501
People in hell
want ice water.

498
00:34:47,503 --> 00:34:51,338
We're just ponds in a
bigger game, you and me.

499
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,509
Sorry, Michael.

500
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:54,969
Hassan.

501
00:34:56,346 --> 00:35:00,016
At least you can help me arrange
an interpreter for a field trip.

502
00:35:02,226 --> 00:35:05,228
I wanna open one of these boxes
and check the expiration dates.

503
00:35:07,065 --> 00:35:08,523
He says he's the
company representative.

504
00:35:08,525 --> 00:35:11,066
Tell him I wanna open
one of these boxes.

505
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:26,459
These pills
expired in 1999.

506
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:32,546
Sick people will get
sicker or die because of these.

507
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:37,175
Every box
needs to be checked,

508
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:39,220
the out of date
medicine needs to be destroyed

509
00:35:39,222 --> 00:35:41,264
and the manufacture
will have to replace it

510
00:35:41,266 --> 00:35:42,599
at their own expense.

511
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:55,237
I should warn you, everyone
here thinks I'm your prostitute.

512
00:35:57,114 --> 00:35:59,158
Well, I guess we should
split the check then.

513
00:36:00,409 --> 00:36:02,409
You can't really
just have a date

514
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:04,579
with an un-chaperoned
woman in Iraq.

515
00:36:04,581 --> 00:36:06,789
There are rituals
and traditions.

516
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:09,085
Do you wanna
call it off then?

517
00:36:11,588 --> 00:36:14,423
Did you tell your boss
what I said about Ahbek?

518
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:18,677
Yeah I did, he uhh...

519
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:22,097
He thinks you might
be a government spy.

520
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,278
So are you?
A spy?

521
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:38,614
Is that
a serious question?

522
00:36:39,449 --> 00:36:42,159
Well, that's a
pretty evasive answer.

523
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:51,333
No.

524
00:36:51,335 --> 00:36:53,671
Now it's
my turn to ask you.

525
00:36:54,422 --> 00:36:55,340
Okay.

526
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:59,508
What are you
doing here?

527
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:02,387
Well umm, I'm doing
a status report

528
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:04,722
for the Oil for Food program
and then I'm gonna...

529
00:37:05,684 --> 00:37:09,309
I mean today, with
the spoiled medicine.

530
00:37:09,311 --> 00:37:13,481
What you did had nothing to
do with writing your report.

531
00:37:13,483 --> 00:37:14,776
You took action.

532
00:37:15,527 --> 00:37:18,487
It was risky
and rather brave.

533
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:21,699
Was that just
to impress me?

534
00:37:24,744 --> 00:37:27,288
I'm not here to
just be a functionary.

535
00:37:28,664 --> 00:37:32,793
I took this job for a reason
because I wanna help people

536
00:37:34,545 --> 00:37:38,338
and I wanna
make a difference.

537
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,883
Make a difference?

538
00:37:40,885 --> 00:37:42,220
Exactly.

539
00:37:45,306 --> 00:37:46,266
I'll drink to that.

540
00:37:47,391 --> 00:37:48,393
Cheers.

541
00:37:52,438 --> 00:37:53,771
They're not
gonna bomb Baghdad,

542
00:37:53,773 --> 00:37:55,731
not without getting
The UN staffers out first.

543
00:37:55,733 --> 00:37:56,566
Mr. Sullivan?

544
00:37:56,568 --> 00:37:57,483
Yeah?

545
00:37:57,485 --> 00:37:58,525
This has
come for you.

546
00:37:58,527 --> 00:38:00,028
Thanks.

547
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,362
Lil, I gotta go.

548
00:38:01,364 --> 00:38:02,487
Who sent this?

549
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,490
It was left on the
night desk, sir.

550
00:38:20,592 --> 00:38:22,133
Are those
Oil for Food trucks?

551
00:38:22,135 --> 00:38:25,010
Yeah, but I don't know
the source of them.

552
00:38:25,012 --> 00:38:28,597
If they're real, they're
proof that we're being gamed

553
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:30,057
by Saddam's regime.

554
00:38:30,059 --> 00:38:32,559
Yeah, If, I still don't
think we should trust them.

555
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:36,023
Using our trucks to deliver
weapons, I mean, what the fuck?

556
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,525
I'm just gonna pack them up
into a courier pouch,

557
00:38:39,527 --> 00:38:41,443
see what Pasha says.

558
00:38:41,445 --> 00:38:42,739
No, no, no.

559
00:38:44,574 --> 00:38:45,865
Let me show
Christina first.

560
00:38:45,867 --> 00:38:48,492
No, no, no chance.

561
00:38:48,494 --> 00:38:50,746
It's okay,
what do you call it?

562
00:38:51,414 --> 00:38:52,582
"Chain of command."

563
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:56,335
Okay.

564
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:24,987
Hi.

565
00:39:24,989 --> 00:39:27,699
Hey.

566
00:39:27,701 --> 00:39:30,200
I need to show
you something.

567
00:39:30,202 --> 00:39:31,621
Okay.

568
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:41,713
They are friends.

569
00:39:41,715 --> 00:39:42,716
Okay.

570
00:40:21,378 --> 00:40:26,175
So, this place
isn't here, officially.

571
00:40:27,052 --> 00:40:29,927
These are the graves
of Kurdish civilians that

572
00:40:29,929 --> 00:40:33,432
Saddam Hussein one day decided
no longer needed to live.

573
00:40:34,726 --> 00:40:38,144
Gas,
Sarin, Tabun, VX.

574
00:40:38,146 --> 00:40:40,065
The smell
of sweet apples.

575
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,735
He doesn't care about your
sanctions or resolutions.

576
00:40:46,737 --> 00:40:50,449
He's the Angel of
Death... Azrael.

577
00:40:52,869 --> 00:40:53,870
You're Kurdish.

578
00:40:55,288 --> 00:40:58,541
My parents were
intellectuals, active in PUK.

579
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:02,378
Killed in Halabdja.

580
00:41:04,088 --> 00:41:04,963
I'm sorry.

581
00:41:06,382 --> 00:41:09,758
Nobody in Baghdad knows
I'm Kurdish, Michael.

582
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,344
If Saddam's
police find out.

583
00:41:11,346 --> 00:41:14,097
They will
disappear me.

584
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:17,432
My friends, they helped Ahbek
uncover a criminal conspiracy

585
00:41:17,434 --> 00:41:21,313
Saddam is using to skim billions
of dollars from Oil for Food.

586
00:41:23,023 --> 00:41:25,900
Ahbek claimed there is a
whole system of corruption that

587
00:41:25,902 --> 00:41:28,735
reaches to the highest levels of
the same Western government

588
00:41:28,737 --> 00:41:30,489
that supports sanctions.

589
00:41:31,615 --> 00:41:33,574
Okay, how did
Ahbek know this?

590
00:41:33,576 --> 00:41:35,827
There is
a rumor of a list.

591
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:38,912
A list that contains names
of people and organizations

592
00:41:38,914 --> 00:41:42,041
all over the world who are all
getting paid off by Saddam

593
00:41:42,043 --> 00:41:44,253
to keep
this system running.

594
00:41:44,713 --> 00:41:46,713
And Ahbek
had seen it.

595
00:41:46,715 --> 00:41:47,713
Did you bring it?

596
00:41:47,715 --> 00:41:48,715
Yes.

597
00:41:48,717 --> 00:41:50,383
May have
had it on his computer.

598
00:41:50,385 --> 00:41:51,925
You sure
nobody saw you?

599
00:41:51,927 --> 00:41:55,345
The office was empty,
everyone had gone home.

600
00:41:55,347 --> 00:41:56,972
Ahbek, what's
going on with you?

601
00:41:56,974 --> 00:42:00,642
I'm going North
across the border.

602
00:42:00,644 --> 00:42:02,188
It's not safe
for me here.

603
00:42:18,746 --> 00:42:20,164
He made a back up.

604
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:24,168
But it's encrypted.

605
00:42:26,003 --> 00:42:28,422
We don't have the
resources to decipher it.

606
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:35,094
Why didn't you take it to
someone more senior in The UN?

607
00:42:35,096 --> 00:42:36,179
I mean, anyone.

608
00:42:36,181 --> 00:42:37,220
Madame Dupre?

609
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:39,974
Nobody would
listen to her.

610
00:42:39,976 --> 00:42:43,394
It's important who
delivers the list.

611
00:42:43,396 --> 00:42:45,854
No one can accuse you
of being Partisan

612
00:42:45,856 --> 00:42:48,231
or of having any
agenda but the truth.

613
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:50,319
I'm not gonna
front this, Nashim.

614
00:42:51,237 --> 00:42:53,320
I'm not
gonna do that.

615
00:42:53,322 --> 00:42:54,613
No, I don't
want that.

616
00:42:54,615 --> 00:42:57,909
I just want you to take it back
with you and find someone

617
00:42:57,911 --> 00:42:59,704
who can break
the encryption.

618
00:43:00,204 --> 00:43:03,875
Then, together we
can decide what to do.

619
00:43:32,027 --> 00:43:32,901
Shit!

620
00:43:32,903 --> 00:43:33,905
It's the Mukhabarat.

621
00:43:37,242 --> 00:43:40,327
Are you fucking
kidding me, Jesus!

622
00:43:54,759 --> 00:43:57,885
There must be
a mistake, I'm a UN official.

623
00:43:57,887 --> 00:43:58,930
The young diplomat.

624
00:44:00,389 --> 00:44:03,141
You know it's very
dangerous for you to be in this

625
00:44:03,143 --> 00:44:05,394
god forsaken
desert unescorted.

626
00:44:05,978 --> 00:44:08,396
The Mukhabarat were concerned
that you might have been

627
00:44:08,398 --> 00:44:10,858
kidnapped by
nefarious individuals.

628
00:44:12,735 --> 00:44:14,945
Consider this a courtesy.

629
00:44:15,362 --> 00:44:16,498
Your Papers.

630
00:44:27,708 --> 00:44:30,083
I tell you this, with all
humility, Mr. Sullivan

631
00:44:30,085 --> 00:44:31,918
because I'm
sure it won't happen again.

632
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,503
Your recent visit to

633
00:44:33,505 --> 00:44:35,965
the pharmaceutical
distribution service

634
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:40,094
that was unnecessarily
provocative, yes?

635
00:44:40,096 --> 00:44:42,597
It would be in everyone's
best interest, in the future,

636
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:48,561
were to decide such inspections
were no longer necessary.

637
00:44:51,148 --> 00:44:53,317
She is my interpreter
alright! I told you!

638
00:45:06,539 --> 00:45:08,956
Go! Now.

639
00:45:08,958 --> 00:45:10,749
Before they
change their minds.

640
00:45:10,751 --> 00:45:12,668
Get in the car.

641
00:45:28,353 --> 00:45:29,476
He kept my papers.

642
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:35,360
It's only a question of time now
before they find out who I am.

643
00:46:05,681 --> 00:46:07,182
Nashim Huesseni.

644
00:46:14,398 --> 00:46:16,398
- Where is the girl?
- What girl?

645
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,983
The Kurdish girl?

646
00:46:17,985 --> 00:46:19,068
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You're lying!

647
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:20,528
- I-I don't know what you're talking about!
- Don't lie!

648
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:21,862
I don't know
where she is.

649
00:46:21,864 --> 00:46:23,197
We saw you
with her!

650
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:24,907
Yeah, I know, but I don't
know where she is, okay.

651
00:46:24,909 --> 00:46:28,702
Let me just...
Let me just make a call.

652
00:46:28,704 --> 00:46:30,331
I don't know
where she is.

653
00:46:31,248 --> 00:46:32,623
Get out!

654
00:46:32,625 --> 00:46:34,541
You have no
jurisdiction here!

655
00:46:34,543 --> 00:46:35,502
Out!

656
00:46:46,056 --> 00:46:50,307
It's Michael Sullivan with
The Baghdad Oil for Food office.

657
00:46:50,309 --> 00:46:51,143
Yeah.

658
00:46:52,478 --> 00:46:53,312
Yeah.

659
00:46:54,773 --> 00:46:57,525
I need to arrange a UNLP
for one of our staffers.

660
00:46:58,693 --> 00:46:59,527
Mhm.

661
00:47:00,903 --> 00:47:04,907
And the name is
Nashim Huesseni.

662
00:47:18,672 --> 00:47:19,753
Hey.

663
00:47:19,755 --> 00:47:21,338
I took all
I could carry.

664
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:23,090
This will get you
into the U.S.

665
00:47:23,092 --> 00:47:25,885
The High Commission for Refugees
will help you get a visa.

666
00:47:25,887 --> 00:47:26,927
I don't know.

667
00:47:26,929 --> 00:47:28,679
I can go to
Kurdish part of Turkey.

668
00:47:28,681 --> 00:47:29,972
I have some
friends there.

669
00:47:29,974 --> 00:47:31,724
No, you'll be
safer in New York.

670
00:47:31,726 --> 00:47:32,974
We'll get you to
The U.S.

671
00:47:32,976 --> 00:47:36,144
then we de-encrypt
the list together.

672
00:47:38,023 --> 00:47:40,691
Go, you cannot
be seen with me.

673
00:47:40,693 --> 00:47:44,945
Whatever happens...

674
00:47:44,947 --> 00:47:46,949
Just promise me
you'll let me know.

675
00:47:48,952 --> 00:47:53,121
Whatever happens,
happens.

676
00:47:53,123 --> 00:47:54,374
Right?

677
00:48:00,963 --> 00:48:01,922
Thank you.

678
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:05,010
Thank you.

679
00:48:24,153 --> 00:48:26,112
Would you please
come to my office?

680
00:48:26,114 --> 00:48:27,740
Immediately.

681
00:48:31,744 --> 00:48:34,037
Did you really expect me
to fall for these...

682
00:48:34,039 --> 00:48:36,039
These, I don't even know
what to call them.

683
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:38,166
Garbage.

684
00:48:38,168 --> 00:48:39,958
What was the plan?

685
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,793
Trick me into
releasing them?

686
00:48:41,795 --> 00:48:44,796
And then force me out when the
evidence comes that it's false?

687
00:48:44,798 --> 00:48:47,592
I'm at a loss to even know
what you're talking about.

688
00:48:47,594 --> 00:48:49,885
Madame, I was sent some
documents and Hassam

689
00:48:49,887 --> 00:48:51,970
wanted to show them
to you, that's it.

690
00:48:51,972 --> 00:48:54,974
You are finished in
the UN, do you hear me?

691
00:48:54,976 --> 00:48:56,099
Your career is over!

692
00:48:56,101 --> 00:48:57,851
What would you
have him do?

693
00:48:57,853 --> 00:48:59,186
He got
some photos...

694
00:48:59,188 --> 00:49:00,188
Shame on you.

695
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:01,900
Shame on
both of you!

696
00:49:04,027 --> 00:49:05,776
The report
is finished.

697
00:49:05,778 --> 00:49:09,030
It tells the truth about
the failure of Oil For Food.

698
00:49:09,032 --> 00:49:12,909
The files are digital,
watermarked, time, date

699
00:49:12,911 --> 00:49:16,704
and I have secure copies so
you can't change anything

700
00:49:16,706 --> 00:49:18,164
when it goes
to New York.

701
00:49:18,166 --> 00:49:21,041
The battle is over,
Costa, and you have lost.

702
00:49:21,043 --> 00:49:22,876
The Security Council
will make their decision

703
00:49:22,878 --> 00:49:24,670
based on the facts.

704
00:49:34,181 --> 00:49:38,016
She's not budging.

705
00:49:38,018 --> 00:49:40,144
Well, fuck.

706
00:49:40,146 --> 00:49:42,646
Nothing more for
you to do there, kid.

707
00:49:42,648 --> 00:49:45,023
Take the next UN
flight and come home.

708
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:48,276
Don't worry about it.

709
00:50:09,925 --> 00:50:13,927
Excuse me sir,
can I see your passport?

710
00:50:13,929 --> 00:50:15,139
Uh, yeah sure.

711
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:25,273
Mr. Sullivan?

712
00:50:25,275 --> 00:50:27,027
I'm gonna need you
to come with us.

713
00:50:48,213 --> 00:50:49,382
Michael,
how're you doing?

714
00:50:51,925 --> 00:50:53,342
I have
nothing for you.

715
00:50:53,344 --> 00:50:56,262
No, that's okay,
I got something for you.

716
00:50:56,264 --> 00:50:59,768
Christina Dupre is dead.

717
00:51:01,311 --> 00:51:04,064
They found her a few
hours ago alone at home.

718
00:51:04,521 --> 00:51:05,898
Heart attack.

719
00:51:06,358 --> 00:51:14,155
At least that's
what they're saying.

720
00:51:14,157 --> 00:51:16,284
Wait, w-what do you mean,
"That's what they're saying?"

721
00:51:19,496 --> 00:51:21,329
What do you think
happened, Mike?

722
00:51:27,003 --> 00:51:29,753
I-I-I don't...
I have no idea.

723
00:51:29,755 --> 00:51:30,713
How would I...?

724
00:51:30,715 --> 00:51:34,300
Your boss,
what does he think?

725
00:51:34,302 --> 00:51:36,052
If you have
questions for Pasha,

726
00:51:36,054 --> 00:51:38,056
you should just
ask him yourself.

727
00:51:39,516 --> 00:51:45,353
Did he ever mention
anything about a list?

728
00:51:45,355 --> 00:51:47,315
No. Why?

729
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:56,790
Michael, is there anything
you wanna tell me right now?

730
00:51:59,327 --> 00:52:00,370
No.

731
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:13,967
Thanks.

732
00:52:51,503 --> 00:52:52,338
Hello?

733
00:52:52,588 --> 00:52:53,590
You're home.

734
00:52:55,382 --> 00:52:57,384
Yeah,
yeah I just got in.

735
00:52:58,469 --> 00:53:01,304
Did you hear
about Madame?

736
00:53:01,306 --> 00:53:02,222
Yeah.

737
00:53:03,474 --> 00:53:04,391
Terrible.

738
00:53:05,268 --> 00:53:06,101
Terrible.

739
00:53:07,478 --> 00:53:09,811
We had our
disagreements, but...

740
00:53:09,813 --> 00:53:11,398
This just
breaks my heart.

741
00:53:13,818 --> 00:53:15,111
And, uh...

742
00:53:15,402 --> 00:53:16,528
And the report?

743
00:53:17,155 --> 00:53:18,695
Hassan assures me
that he doesn't share

744
00:53:18,697 --> 00:53:20,865
Madame's determination
to blow up the program.

745
00:53:20,867 --> 00:53:22,407
He'll sign off...

746
00:53:22,409 --> 00:53:25,538
...as her successor, on whatever
we need to get re-funded.

747
00:53:26,246 --> 00:53:27,454
Madame was wrong.

748
00:53:27,456 --> 00:53:28,831
Being fucking dead
doesn't change that.

749
00:53:28,833 --> 00:53:30,874
You've got two days
to clean this up.

750
00:53:30,876 --> 00:53:34,170
What-what do you mean I've
got two days to clean this up?

751
00:53:34,172 --> 00:53:35,713
I've been
thinking I might need you

752
00:53:35,715 --> 00:53:37,423
to present
the oral summary.

753
00:53:37,425 --> 00:53:38,548
Wait.

754
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:40,885
You want me to
present the report?

755
00:53:40,887 --> 00:53:42,887
To the whole
fucking Security Council.

756
00:53:42,889 --> 00:53:44,847
Isn't that breach
of protocol, Pasha?

757
00:53:45,849 --> 00:53:47,432
I can do what I like.

758
00:53:47,434 --> 00:53:49,434
Besides, they should be
hearing from somebody close

759
00:53:49,436 --> 00:53:52,479
to the ground, and whom
else can I trust to do it?

760
00:53:55,275 --> 00:53:56,652
Okay, yeah.

761
00:53:57,945 --> 00:53:58,779
Hm.

762
00:54:17,423 --> 00:54:18,423
Are you kidding me?

763
00:54:18,425 --> 00:54:19,757
This is such
a big deal.

764
00:54:19,759 --> 00:54:21,592
For somebody at your
pay grade to stand

765
00:54:21,594 --> 00:54:23,885
before
The Security Council?

766
00:54:23,887 --> 00:54:26,516
Yeah, no I know,
it's a great opportunity.

767
00:54:27,559 --> 00:54:28,974
What?

768
00:54:28,976 --> 00:54:30,517
Where did
you get this?

769
00:54:30,519 --> 00:54:32,436
A friend in Baghdad.

770
00:54:32,438 --> 00:54:35,981
Uh no, I mean
I can't crack this.

771
00:54:35,983 --> 00:54:39,526
Do you know
anyone who can?

772
00:54:39,528 --> 00:54:41,364
Do you even know
what's on the drive?

773
00:54:43,532 --> 00:54:45,700
Uh, no.

774
00:54:45,702 --> 00:54:47,746
Do you know anyone
who can crack it?

775
00:54:48,413 --> 00:54:49,746
I'll give it a try.

776
00:54:49,748 --> 00:54:52,498
Do you mind if
I hold onto this?

777
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,083
Yeah, keep it.

778
00:54:54,085 --> 00:54:58,463
Hi, yeah I was given this as a
possible contact number for her.

779
00:54:58,465 --> 00:54:59,923
Yeah, exactly,
Michael Sullivan.

780
00:55:03,469 --> 00:55:04,927
No,
I understand, yeah.

781
00:55:04,929 --> 00:55:07,554
Just the number I gave you,
if you could make sure you

782
00:55:07,556 --> 00:55:09,057
or one of your
colleagues gets, uh,

783
00:55:09,059 --> 00:55:11,601
gets back to me if you
hear anything at all.

784
00:55:15,565 --> 00:55:16,521
Madame Dupre's death

785
00:55:16,523 --> 00:55:18,609
hung over Oil For Food
like a cloud.

786
00:55:19,735 --> 00:55:22,487
But Pasha had a clear
path to what he wanted.

787
00:55:27,619 --> 00:55:32,162
I focused on
writing the report.

788
00:55:32,164 --> 00:55:34,624
I didn't want anyone to
doubt that I deserved

789
00:55:34,626 --> 00:55:36,002
to be in that room.

790
00:55:37,836 --> 00:55:40,630
I couldn't help
thinking about my father.

791
00:55:40,632 --> 00:55:44,175
Whether he had stood before
the council like I would.

792
00:55:44,177 --> 00:55:46,971
Whether he would think that
what I was doing was right.

793
00:56:16,001 --> 00:56:16,835
You okay?

794
00:56:17,668 --> 00:56:19,003
I'm okay now.

795
00:57:22,067 --> 00:57:26,276
They have 100 percent fucking
certainty WMD's in Iraq,

796
00:57:26,278 --> 00:57:28,403
and zero percent
certainty where they are?

797
00:57:28,405 --> 00:57:29,657
Let me call
you back.

798
00:57:30,282 --> 00:57:31,490
Finished.

799
00:57:31,492 --> 00:57:33,494
Pending your review
and Hassan's sign-off.

800
00:57:35,163 --> 00:57:36,664
That's my boy.

801
00:57:37,081 --> 00:57:38,208
Good work.

802
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:51,177
I got a call from oversight
about your UNLP request

803
00:57:51,179 --> 00:57:53,220
for our sexy
little translator.

804
00:57:53,222 --> 00:57:55,305
They asked me
to look into it.

805
00:57:55,307 --> 00:57:57,516
I believe she's
in New York now.

806
00:57:57,518 --> 00:57:58,477
Right.

807
00:57:59,311 --> 00:58:00,394
She's Kurdish.

808
00:58:00,396 --> 00:58:01,311
She needs asylum.

809
00:58:01,313 --> 00:58:02,688
The D-4 were after her.

810
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:04,231
They killed two
of her countrymen.

811
00:58:04,233 --> 00:58:06,152
Kurds don't
have a country.

812
00:58:18,123 --> 00:58:20,123
She makes friends
like you everywhere.

813
00:58:20,125 --> 00:58:21,624
Oldest trick
in the book.

814
00:58:21,626 --> 00:58:23,333
The honeypot...

815
00:58:23,335 --> 00:58:25,253
CIA calls it
the "dangle" now.

816
00:58:25,255 --> 00:58:28,213
Seduce the mark,
tell him fairy tales.

817
00:58:28,215 --> 00:58:35,137
It's not the Russians, notice:
CIA, MI5, Interpol...

818
00:58:35,139 --> 00:58:36,555
Girl has
a big following.

819
00:58:36,557 --> 00:58:39,474
Pashmerga sent her to school in
England, got her phony papers

820
00:58:39,476 --> 00:58:43,271
and a job at
The Baghdad UN.

821
00:58:43,273 --> 00:58:45,025
What did she
want you to do?

822
00:58:46,775 --> 00:58:48,150
Nothing.

823
00:58:48,152 --> 00:58:50,445
I bet she's highly
skilled in the soft arts.

824
00:58:56,952 --> 00:58:58,744
What you did is
stupid and illegal.

825
00:58:58,746 --> 00:59:00,037
I'll make it go away.

826
00:59:00,039 --> 00:59:02,206
But in future, if you're
gonna do these things,

827
00:59:02,208 --> 00:59:03,999
you've got to
come to me first.

828
00:59:18,391 --> 00:59:20,057
Who gave you this?

829
00:59:20,059 --> 00:59:21,643
It doesn't matter.

830
00:59:23,521 --> 00:59:25,271
You've been using me.

831
00:59:25,273 --> 00:59:26,396
No.

832
00:59:26,398 --> 00:59:27,775
Yes.

833
00:59:29,985 --> 00:59:33,278
You said you
wanted to help.

834
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,030
Our meeting wasn't
like that, I really...

835
00:59:35,032 --> 00:59:35,990
Fucking bullshit,
Nashim.

836
00:59:35,992 --> 00:59:37,909
I know how
this works.

837
00:59:37,911 --> 00:59:39,202
Do you?

838
00:59:39,204 --> 00:59:40,787
Yeah.

839
00:59:40,789 --> 00:59:43,623
Yes, okay, I am guilty
of taking a job in Baghdad

840
00:59:43,625 --> 00:59:46,626
and trying to find a way
to help my people get free

841
00:59:46,628 --> 00:59:50,088
of a dictator who wants
to exterminate us.

842
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:53,925
And yes, I talked with men
who might be of help,

843
00:59:53,927 --> 00:59:56,760
but I didn't sleep with
any of them, okay?

844
00:59:56,762 --> 00:59:57,804
I didn't have to.

845
00:59:57,806 --> 01:00:02,016
Nashim, you have asked me
to risk my life for a list that

846
01:00:02,018 --> 01:00:05,353
I don't even know where
the fuck it came from.

847
01:00:05,355 --> 01:00:06,313
This is...

848
01:00:12,695 --> 01:00:15,824
I'm sorry,
but this is who I am.

849
01:00:21,286 --> 01:00:22,830
Do you
want me to leave?

850
01:01:23,516 --> 01:01:24,724
Hi.

851
01:01:24,726 --> 01:01:25,974
Hey.

852
01:01:25,976 --> 01:01:27,309
Came to
wish you luck.

853
01:01:27,311 --> 01:01:28,978
Hey, man.

854
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:30,021
Knock 'em dead.

855
01:01:30,023 --> 01:01:31,021
Thank you.

856
01:01:31,023 --> 01:01:31,938
Michael.

857
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:32,773
Ready?

858
01:01:32,775 --> 01:01:33,648
Yeah.

859
01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:34,483
You'll do great.

860
01:01:34,485 --> 01:01:35,318
Relax.

861
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:36,321
Thanks.

862
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:42,240
In an unusual
move at todays United Nations

863
01:01:42,242 --> 01:01:43,825
Oil For Food vote

864
01:01:43,827 --> 01:01:47,329
Under-secretary General Costa
Passaris yielded his chair

865
01:01:47,331 --> 01:01:49,414
to his Executive Assistant,
Michael Sullivan

866
01:01:49,416 --> 01:01:52,793
to present the report on
the status of the program.

867
01:01:52,795 --> 01:01:55,796
The uh, Oil For Food program
continues to achieve

868
01:01:55,798 --> 01:01:58,675
it's core mission of providing
humanitarian relief.

869
01:01:58,677 --> 01:02:00,967
The request for
continued funding comes in the

870
01:02:00,969 --> 01:02:03,470
wake of the sudden death of
Baghdad field director,

871
01:02:03,472 --> 01:02:06,766
Christina Dupre who was a
vocal critic of the program.

872
01:02:06,768 --> 01:02:09,142
And against the backdrop
of intensified efforts

873
01:02:09,144 --> 01:02:11,354
to find Saddam Hussein's
suspected caches

874
01:02:11,356 --> 01:02:13,231
of weapons of
mass destruction.

875
01:02:13,233 --> 01:02:20,780
Continuing resolution 986, the
council has voted unanimously

876
01:02:20,782 --> 01:02:25,284
to extend funding for
another 180 days.

877
01:02:25,286 --> 01:02:27,369
Michael Sullivan
addressed the press after

878
01:02:27,371 --> 01:02:28,414
The Security
Council vote.

879
01:02:53,398 --> 01:02:57,733
I don't understand why he
would want to invite me.

880
01:02:57,735 --> 01:02:59,026
I know.

881
01:02:59,028 --> 01:02:59,860
Me neither.

882
01:02:59,862 --> 01:03:00,820
Let's get
a drink, okay?

883
01:03:00,822 --> 01:03:02,195
Here you are.

884
01:03:02,197 --> 01:03:03,197
My protégé.

885
01:03:03,199 --> 01:03:05,657
Michael Sullivan.

886
01:03:05,659 --> 01:03:07,786
Timur Rasnetsov.

887
01:03:09,539 --> 01:03:14,624
Costa insists you are
the hero of Oil For Food.

888
01:03:14,626 --> 01:03:16,670
And here is Nashim.

889
01:03:17,005 --> 01:03:19,046
Lovely.

890
01:03:19,048 --> 01:03:20,715
Welcome to the USA.

891
01:03:20,717 --> 01:03:22,717
Thank you.

892
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:24,052
Where is your drink?

893
01:03:24,054 --> 01:03:27,514
I think we even have
some Arak tucked away.

894
01:03:30,851 --> 01:03:31,810
So how
have you been?

895
01:03:33,646 --> 01:03:35,646
Fine, thank you.

896
01:03:35,648 --> 01:03:38,775
Great.

897
01:03:38,777 --> 01:03:40,776
Well, enjoy your evening.

898
01:03:51,706 --> 01:03:53,873
You must be the young diplomat,
Michael Sullivan

899
01:03:53,875 --> 01:03:56,083
my husband is always
talking about.

900
01:03:56,085 --> 01:03:57,459
Nice to meet you,
pleasure.

901
01:03:57,461 --> 01:03:58,878
I'm Melina,
Pasha's wife.

902
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,796
Ah, of course,
yes, yes.

903
01:04:00,798 --> 01:04:04,883
Pasha gushes about you, and
Pasha doesn't gush about anyone.

904
01:04:04,885 --> 01:04:07,052
Well he certainly
taught me a lot.

905
01:04:07,054 --> 01:04:08,847
It can never work.

906
01:04:10,724 --> 01:04:13,059
Is that a proud papa over
protecting his surrogate son?

907
01:04:13,061 --> 01:04:18,481
Don't patronize me.

908
01:04:18,483 --> 01:04:21,486
Is it so unthinkable that I
could be in love with him?

909
01:04:22,945 --> 01:04:24,697
You are what you are.

910
01:04:27,157 --> 01:04:28,826
You cannot fool me.

911
01:04:31,829 --> 01:04:33,623
You gave him
the file on me.

912
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,708
Listen.

913
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:40,503
If you do anything to
compromise the kid or hurt him,

914
01:04:40,505 --> 01:04:43,758
I will have you deported
so fast your hijab will spin.

915
01:04:46,135 --> 01:04:49,137
You know what,
I have to um, I have to go.

916
01:04:49,139 --> 01:04:51,516
My apologies, I have
to deal with something.

917
01:04:53,643 --> 01:04:55,976
How-how long have
you known that guy for?

918
01:04:55,978 --> 01:04:58,938
He came with a
delegation, we just met.

919
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:00,481
Why?

920
01:05:00,483 --> 01:05:02,733
He was the one that tried to
bribe me in my hotel in Baghdad.

921
01:05:02,735 --> 01:05:03,775
Huh.

922
01:05:03,777 --> 01:05:05,153
Apparently he's
very well connected.

923
01:05:05,155 --> 01:05:05,987
Could be useful.

924
01:05:09,992 --> 01:05:11,536
I gotta go.

925
01:05:11,786 --> 01:05:14,748
What the fuck was that
man doing at the party?

926
01:05:16,541 --> 01:05:17,667
I don't know.

927
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:21,003
What did Pasha want?

928
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:27,008
He threatened me.

929
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:28,633
Your boss
threatened me.

930
01:05:33,557 --> 01:05:34,682
Hello?

931
01:05:34,684 --> 01:05:36,266
Michael, my guy
came through.

932
01:05:36,268 --> 01:05:38,269
You better
come see this.

933
01:05:38,271 --> 01:05:40,063
Uh, you're not
gonna believe this.

934
01:05:40,065 --> 01:05:43,775
Um, Saddam has been selling oil
vouchers at a discount

935
01:05:43,777 --> 01:05:46,651
to people who turn around,
resell the vouchers

936
01:05:46,653 --> 01:05:50,072
at the going oil peak rate
for a huge profit.

937
01:05:50,074 --> 01:05:52,784
Saddam gets a kickback,
a share of the difference

938
01:05:52,786 --> 01:05:55,244
between his discount
and the going rate.

939
01:05:55,246 --> 01:05:57,662
How much
did he make?

940
01:05:57,664 --> 01:06:00,999
Could be over
a billion dollars.

941
01:06:01,001 --> 01:06:03,043
Jesus Christ.

942
01:06:03,045 --> 01:06:04,878
Do we know
if these are real?

943
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:06,088
They look real.

944
01:06:06,090 --> 01:06:07,923
And it looks
like a system.

945
01:06:07,925 --> 01:06:10,300
There's a list of
all the major players...

946
01:06:10,302 --> 01:06:14,054
politicians,
businessmen, bankers,

947
01:06:14,056 --> 01:06:18,851
we're talking highly-placed
people at the very heart

948
01:06:18,853 --> 01:06:20,811
of most first
world governments,

949
01:06:20,813 --> 01:06:23,982
and they are taking millions
of dollars in bribes.

950
01:06:24,275 --> 01:06:25,108
This is real.

951
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:26,650
Of course,
it's real.

952
01:06:26,652 --> 01:06:28,735
Well, to prove it you're
gonna need records

953
01:06:28,737 --> 01:06:31,113
of the
actual transactions.

954
01:06:31,115 --> 01:06:32,865
You need to give
this to Pasha.

955
01:06:32,867 --> 01:06:34,200
This is a UN
internal matter.

956
01:06:34,202 --> 01:06:37,244
You do not want to be left
holding the bag on this.

957
01:06:37,246 --> 01:06:41,916
Amongst the encrypted documents
I found this video codec.

958
01:06:41,918 --> 01:06:44,043
How long
does it run for?

959
01:06:44,045 --> 01:06:45,128
71 minutes.

960
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:47,130
71 minutes is
a strange time.

961
01:06:47,132 --> 01:06:48,715
I started to
scroll through it,

962
01:06:48,717 --> 01:06:50,300
but it's all pretty
much the same.

963
01:06:53,847 --> 01:07:00,059
Zoom in.

964
01:07:00,061 --> 01:07:01,021
Scroll back.

965
01:07:28,297 --> 01:07:29,921
I knew it.

966
01:07:29,923 --> 01:07:31,007
I fuckin' knew it.

967
01:07:31,009 --> 01:07:32,467
I knew...

968
01:07:32,469 --> 01:07:34,054
I knew
that he was involved.

969
01:07:34,304 --> 01:07:36,470
We need to
make the list public.

970
01:07:36,472 --> 01:07:38,180
We can't do that.

971
01:07:38,182 --> 01:07:39,264
They'll just deny it.

972
01:07:39,266 --> 01:07:41,266
And then all we do
is destroy The UN.

973
01:07:41,268 --> 01:07:44,686
We need to find someone
to start asking questions.

974
01:07:44,688 --> 01:07:45,979
The media,
your congress.

975
01:07:45,981 --> 01:07:47,190
The truth
will come out.

976
01:07:47,192 --> 01:07:48,775
Look, all these powerful
interests at play...

977
01:07:48,777 --> 01:07:50,776
they will decide
what the truth is.

978
01:07:50,778 --> 01:07:53,362
Pasha will be the sacrificial
lamb and my career is over.

979
01:07:53,364 --> 01:07:54,947
You're not
part of this.

980
01:07:54,949 --> 01:07:56,157
Of course I'm
fucking part of this.

981
01:07:56,159 --> 01:07:58,159
I just gave a speech about
the integrity of Oil For Food.

982
01:07:58,161 --> 01:07:59,159
What are you saying?

983
01:07:59,161 --> 01:08:00,119
Do nothing?

984
01:08:00,121 --> 01:08:01,498
I don't know
what I'm saying.

985
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,186
What's going on?

986
01:08:26,064 --> 01:08:28,147
Michael! Stop it!

987
01:08:28,149 --> 01:08:29,984
Michael!

988
01:08:42,454 --> 01:08:43,537
Hey man, you okay?

989
01:08:43,539 --> 01:08:44,371
Yeah, yeah.

990
01:08:44,373 --> 01:08:46,001
You need me
to call 911?

991
01:09:28,292 --> 01:09:29,291
Where is she?

992
01:09:29,293 --> 01:09:30,125
I don't know.

993
01:09:30,127 --> 01:09:31,460
Call your friend,

994
01:09:31,462 --> 01:09:33,420
tell him I will trade
what he wants for Nashim.

995
01:09:33,422 --> 01:09:34,964
He's not my friend.

996
01:09:34,966 --> 01:09:38,011
Pasha, I have a video of you
taking a fucking bribe from him.

997
01:09:39,511 --> 01:09:43,305
You gonna come inside kid, or
do we have to do this out here?

998
01:09:43,307 --> 01:09:46,099
We're gonna
do this out here.

999
01:09:46,101 --> 01:09:49,102
I take a cut, sure.

1000
01:09:49,104 --> 01:09:50,103
Why not?

1001
01:09:50,105 --> 01:09:52,231
Everyone else has.

1002
01:09:52,233 --> 01:09:55,317
I put my whole career
on the line for this mission,

1003
01:09:55,319 --> 01:09:57,237
every fucking day.

1004
01:09:59,323 --> 01:10:01,116
Come inside kid,
it's cold.

1005
01:10:08,832 --> 01:10:11,500
Rasnetsov is a fixer.

1006
01:10:11,502 --> 01:10:14,379
He's a very
dangerous man.

1007
01:10:14,381 --> 01:10:19,258
Nothing in Iraq runs,
nothing without him.

1008
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:20,468
And who runs him?

1009
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:22,260
Highest bidder.

1010
01:10:22,262 --> 01:10:25,723
Moscow, Beijing, Saddam,
Hedge funds, mafia, greed.

1011
01:10:25,725 --> 01:10:30,477
Rasnetsov is the bridge
between politics and reality.

1012
01:10:30,479 --> 01:10:32,272
And whose side
are you on, Pasha?

1013
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:36,567
Ah, I thought
I heard you come in.

1014
01:10:36,569 --> 01:10:38,238
Sit down
Michael, please.

1015
01:10:40,864 --> 01:10:42,242
I'll make the call.

1016
01:10:46,371 --> 01:10:47,454
Coffee?

1017
01:10:48,372 --> 01:10:49,748
Uh, yeah, thanks.

1018
01:10:55,546 --> 01:10:57,381
Did you enjoy
the party last night?

1019
01:10:57,798 --> 01:10:59,924
Yeah we had a
great time, thank you.

1020
01:10:59,926 --> 01:11:01,384
You left so early.

1021
01:11:01,386 --> 01:11:02,509
I wondered.

1022
01:11:02,511 --> 01:11:03,969
Uh, yeah,
my friend, uh...

1023
01:11:03,971 --> 01:11:05,681
she wasn't
feeling too well.

1024
01:11:08,935 --> 01:11:11,604
It's flu season.

1025
01:11:13,314 --> 01:11:16,566
Yeah.

1026
01:11:16,568 --> 01:11:23,531
Well,
I'll leave you to it.

1027
01:11:23,533 --> 01:11:25,407
They've handed her
over to immigration.

1028
01:11:25,409 --> 01:11:26,911
Okay, well
she has papers.

1029
01:11:27,537 --> 01:11:29,829
I think you'll
find they're missing.

1030
01:11:29,831 --> 01:11:30,912
She's become
an irritation.

1031
01:11:30,914 --> 01:11:32,373
If she gets
deported to Iraq

1032
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:33,958
they will execute
her for treason.

1033
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:36,919
They'll send her back to Baghdad
where I still have some sway...

1034
01:11:36,921 --> 01:11:38,920
No, you call him
back and tell him

1035
01:11:38,922 --> 01:11:41,924
I'm not gonna give up the list
until Nashim is set free.

1036
01:11:41,926 --> 01:11:43,384
That's not
how it works.

1037
01:11:43,386 --> 01:11:44,384
You need
to trust me.

1038
01:11:44,386 --> 01:11:45,635
I did trust
you, Pasha.

1039
01:11:45,637 --> 01:11:49,389
I trusted you and you
fucked me at every turn.

1040
01:11:49,391 --> 01:11:50,767
Look
where we are.

1041
01:11:50,769 --> 01:11:52,059
Committing crimes
and taking bribes.

1042
01:11:52,061 --> 01:11:54,144
The crime would have
been to do nothing.

1043
01:11:54,146 --> 01:11:56,063
To watch
innocents suffer and die.

1044
01:11:56,065 --> 01:11:56,938
What about Dupre?

1045
01:11:56,940 --> 01:11:57,982
What about Abhek?

1046
01:11:57,984 --> 01:11:59,400
What was the
justification for that?

1047
01:11:59,402 --> 01:12:00,987
We didn't
make the storm.

1048
01:12:01,654 --> 01:12:03,821
And we can't
control the storm.

1049
01:12:03,823 --> 01:12:06,741
All we can do is plot
our course, set our sails,

1050
01:12:06,743 --> 01:12:08,576
and try to
do our best.

1051
01:12:08,578 --> 01:12:09,951
As we did,
and we do.

1052
01:12:09,953 --> 01:12:10,995
Best for who, Pasha?

1053
01:12:10,997 --> 01:12:11,954
Best for you.

1054
01:12:11,956 --> 01:12:13,039
Not best for Nashim.

1055
01:12:13,041 --> 01:12:15,040
Not best
for her people.

1056
01:12:15,042 --> 01:12:19,795
Ah, look, maybe
you love this spy, fuck.

1057
01:12:19,797 --> 01:12:21,840
Who am I to argue
with the heart?

1058
01:12:25,095 --> 01:12:26,637
Don't let her
get you killed.

1059
01:12:32,769 --> 01:12:36,064
We can help her people,
but we have to do it our way.

1060
01:12:37,106 --> 01:12:40,607
Bush's Coalition of The Willing
is going to Invade Iraq

1061
01:12:40,609 --> 01:12:42,192
in a matter
of days now.

1062
01:12:42,194 --> 01:12:46,656
Consensus is changing, and the
new truth is Saddam is history,

1063
01:12:46,658 --> 01:12:49,701
and Oil For Food can be
successful framework

1064
01:12:49,703 --> 01:12:52,786
for rebuilding of a new
free Iraq

1065
01:12:52,788 --> 01:12:54,998
in which
The United Nations,

1066
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,583
not the carpetbaggers
and craven governments

1067
01:12:57,585 --> 01:12:58,710
who created
this nightmare...

1068
01:12:58,712 --> 01:13:00,797
The UN can take
the lead fucking role.

1069
01:13:02,506 --> 01:13:03,590
You and me, kid.

1070
01:13:06,094 --> 01:13:09,931
We can save the world
and save your girl.

1071
01:13:16,604 --> 01:13:17,814
Trust me.

1072
01:13:21,650 --> 01:13:26,653
My fellow citizens, at this hour
American in Coalition forces

1073
01:13:26,655 --> 01:13:29,115
are in the early stages
of military operations

1074
01:13:29,117 --> 01:13:31,867
to disarm Iraq,
to free it's people

1075
01:13:31,869 --> 01:13:34,163
and to defend
the world from grave danger.

1076
01:13:38,335 --> 01:13:43,045
Over the next 24 to 48
hours perhaps as many as 3000.

1077
01:13:43,047 --> 01:13:46,132
3000 tomahawk
cruise missiles,

1078
01:13:46,134 --> 01:13:48,634
satellite guided
precision bombs,

1079
01:13:48,636 --> 01:13:51,763
laser guided bombs would
be dropped on various targets.

1080
01:13:51,765 --> 01:13:53,723
Not only in Baghdad...

1081
01:13:53,725 --> 01:13:56,644
among Baghdad, but
elsewhere around the...

1082
01:14:04,109 --> 01:14:07,778
Six weeks after the
invasion I was back in Baghdad

1083
01:14:07,780 --> 01:14:10,865
to work on Pasha's
plan to put The UN in charge of

1084
01:14:10,867 --> 01:14:13,742
rebuilding
the new Iraq.

1085
01:14:13,744 --> 01:14:15,160
The sanctions
were lifted.

1086
01:14:15,162 --> 01:14:17,746
The free market
would power the country.

1087
01:14:17,748 --> 01:14:20,290
Free elections would give
every citizen a voice,

1088
01:14:20,292 --> 01:14:21,877
and oil would
pay the bills.

1089
01:14:24,506 --> 01:14:27,799
Pasha still had
strong connections.

1090
01:14:27,801 --> 01:14:29,678
And he kept
his promise to me.

1091
01:14:36,350 --> 01:14:37,685
Nashim Husseini.

1092
01:15:28,819 --> 01:15:30,738
It's nice when
we're together.

1093
01:15:32,032 --> 01:15:33,408
Blank pages.

1094
01:15:40,582 --> 01:15:42,042
I missed you.

1095
01:15:49,466 --> 01:15:51,176
I have
something for you.

1096
01:15:56,430 --> 01:16:02,768
A new passport
and a visa so here.

1097
01:16:02,770 --> 01:16:04,773
You can stay as
long as you want.

1098
01:16:07,192 --> 01:16:08,859
And what
about the list?

1099
01:16:12,197 --> 01:16:13,782
I gave it to Pasha.

1100
01:16:17,452 --> 01:16:20,035
You traded
the list for me?

1101
01:16:20,037 --> 01:16:20,911
Yeah.

1102
01:16:20,913 --> 01:16:21,870
Why?

1103
01:16:21,872 --> 01:16:22,996
I didn't exactly
have a choice.

1104
01:16:22,998 --> 01:16:24,706
I made a
judgment call, okay?

1105
01:16:24,708 --> 01:16:28,251
And what do you think is
going to happen with Pasha now?

1106
01:16:28,253 --> 01:16:31,048
Pasha can still do a
lot of good in The UN.

1107
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:32,757
You are dreaming.

1108
01:16:32,759 --> 01:16:33,924
I'm not dreaming.

1109
01:16:33,926 --> 01:16:35,425
I'm not dreaming,
I'm not, okay?

1110
01:16:35,427 --> 01:16:37,344
Consensus has changed,
and with Saddam gone

1111
01:16:37,346 --> 01:16:39,347
we can actually
do a lot of good.

1112
01:16:39,349 --> 01:16:40,682
Finally...

1113
01:16:40,684 --> 01:16:41,848
Just by thinking you
can work with the criminals

1114
01:16:41,850 --> 01:16:45,812
to take what you
want you are lost.

1115
01:16:45,814 --> 01:16:48,815
Well, it wasn't exactly a
fight we were gonna win, was it?

1116
01:16:48,817 --> 01:16:52,442
I put all my
fucking life on this.

1117
01:16:52,444 --> 01:16:55,237
Who are you to
decide that for me?

1118
01:16:55,239 --> 01:16:56,573
You said it yourself.

1119
01:16:58,158 --> 01:17:00,953
It's very, very
fucking complicated.

1120
01:17:03,456 --> 01:17:06,126
No,
not this part.

1121
01:17:08,043 --> 01:17:11,963
This part
is very simple.

1122
01:17:11,965 --> 01:17:14,050
I don't wanna
be a part of this.

1123
01:17:14,676 --> 01:17:16,800
I can't.

1124
01:17:16,802 --> 01:17:19,305
Nashim, Nashim,
wait, wait, wait.

1125
01:17:21,474 --> 01:17:22,851
Nashim!

1126
01:17:36,530 --> 01:17:38,531
I'm told you aren't
answering your phone.

1127
01:17:38,533 --> 01:17:40,201
What the fuck?

1128
01:17:41,578 --> 01:17:42,701
Yeah, I've been busy.

1129
01:17:42,703 --> 01:17:49,083
Yeah.

1130
01:17:49,085 --> 01:17:50,295
I heard.

1131
01:17:51,212 --> 01:17:53,170
Your Kurd
took a walk.

1132
01:17:53,172 --> 01:17:56,134
Relationships are
a train wreck.

1133
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:00,719
Come on, kid.

1134
01:18:00,721 --> 01:18:02,597
You wanted a
career in diplomacy.

1135
01:18:02,599 --> 01:18:08,311
Well, you're missing
your golden moment.

1136
01:18:08,313 --> 01:18:09,898
See you
at the office.

1137
01:18:28,332 --> 01:18:30,585
Pasha I have those medical
contracts for you to...

1138
01:18:35,465 --> 01:18:37,132
I was on
my way out.

1139
01:18:38,217 --> 01:18:39,759
Pasha.

1140
01:18:39,761 --> 01:18:40,720
Abiento.

1141
01:18:48,603 --> 01:18:50,730
It's good to see
you again, Michael.

1142
01:18:58,154 --> 01:18:59,489
You think I like it?

1143
01:19:00,448 --> 01:19:02,490
He's got the world
in his pocket, kid.

1144
01:19:02,492 --> 01:19:04,659
All the major fucking
players in the reconstruction.

1145
01:19:04,661 --> 01:19:05,660
I don't understand.

1146
01:19:05,662 --> 01:19:07,285
When did he
get back into this?

1147
01:19:07,287 --> 01:19:09,580
He never left, he just
moved into the shadows,

1148
01:19:09,582 --> 01:19:11,209
as the stakes
got higher.

1149
01:19:11,667 --> 01:19:13,291
There's no one else.

1150
01:19:13,293 --> 01:19:14,753
We've been
through this, Michael.

1151
01:19:17,798 --> 01:19:19,591
I'm not gonna
fucking deal with him.

1152
01:19:22,302 --> 01:19:23,430
What?

1153
01:19:27,516 --> 01:19:28,933
This is
how it works.

1154
01:19:36,067 --> 01:19:39,317
The optimism of
liberation was short lived.

1155
01:19:39,319 --> 01:19:41,486
It turned out nobody
had made plans for

1156
01:19:41,488 --> 01:19:44,197
what to do after
Saddam was gone.

1157
01:19:44,199 --> 01:19:45,866
The Americans
had purged everyone

1158
01:19:45,868 --> 01:19:48,076
who had been loyal
to the regime,

1159
01:19:48,078 --> 01:19:49,704
which meant there
wasn't anybody left

1160
01:19:49,706 --> 01:19:51,458
who knew how
to run the country.

1161
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:55,876
Renetsov and all the other
fixtures like him filled

1162
01:19:55,878 --> 01:20:00,048
that vacuum of power, and out
to control the game again.

1163
01:20:00,050 --> 01:20:03,884
Iraq spiraled into
anarchy, chaos, and terror.

1164
01:20:09,641 --> 01:20:10,892
All those
countries that had been

1165
01:20:10,894 --> 01:20:14,437
scamming Oil For Food
before the war,

1166
01:20:14,439 --> 01:20:17,272
well, they got ready
to carve Iraq up.

1167
01:20:19,069 --> 01:20:22,320
Like it was
one big pie.

1168
01:20:22,322 --> 01:20:23,364
And me?

1169
01:20:24,282 --> 01:20:27,532
I was going
through the motions.

1170
01:20:27,534 --> 01:20:28,951
I'd lost
my faith in it.

1171
01:20:44,886 --> 01:20:46,052
Hello?

1172
01:20:46,054 --> 01:20:47,471
It's Nashim.

1173
01:20:49,099 --> 01:20:49,974
Hey.

1174
01:20:51,975 --> 01:20:52,933
You okay?

1175
01:20:52,935 --> 01:20:54,352
I need to see you.

1176
01:20:54,354 --> 01:20:55,689
Can you
come downstairs?

1177
01:20:57,690 --> 01:20:58,692
Sure.

1178
01:21:11,121 --> 01:21:13,537
Michael,
good to see you.

1179
01:21:13,539 --> 01:21:14,416
Yeah.

1180
01:21:15,082 --> 01:21:17,959
I got someone
you gotta meet.

1181
01:21:17,961 --> 01:21:19,742
We need
your help, Michael.

1182
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:30,804
Michael Sullivan,
Mr. Shaswar Rauf.

1183
01:21:30,806 --> 01:21:32,098
Yeah,
we met before.

1184
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:36,936
He will play a
central role in a New Iraq.

1185
01:21:36,938 --> 01:21:39,606
You ever heard of a
guy named Resnetsov?

1186
01:21:40,984 --> 01:21:42,107
Yeah.

1187
01:21:42,109 --> 01:21:44,110
Yeah?
You ever met him?

1188
01:21:44,112 --> 01:21:46,573
A few times, uh,
before the invasion.

1189
01:21:47,740 --> 01:21:48,742
How 'bout after?

1190
01:21:52,162 --> 01:21:52,996
No I didn't.

1191
01:21:54,581 --> 01:21:57,790
Well now him and his criminal
gang from Oil For Food are back,

1192
01:21:57,792 --> 01:21:59,753
and they're
creating a mess in Iraq.

1193
01:22:01,796 --> 01:22:02,672
Yeah.

1194
01:22:07,135 --> 01:22:10,553
You know there was a list
of, uh, individuals and

1195
01:22:10,555 --> 01:22:13,973
organizations that were helping
Saddam fleece Oil For Food.

1196
01:22:13,975 --> 01:22:15,808
You guys know
about that, don't you?

1197
01:22:15,810 --> 01:22:18,811
Yeah, but there was no way
to prove what was on it.

1198
01:22:18,813 --> 01:22:21,565
No, proof was in
the Iraq Oil Ministry.

1199
01:22:22,108 --> 01:22:24,192
Official files that were
taken by the US troops

1200
01:22:24,194 --> 01:22:26,110
after the
government fell.

1201
01:22:26,112 --> 01:22:29,280
Proof that is probably still in
the basement of the UN

1202
01:22:29,282 --> 01:22:31,991
somewhere if anyone
cared to look.

1203
01:22:31,993 --> 01:22:33,241
Look,
forget about the list.

1204
01:22:33,243 --> 01:22:35,119
We don't want
the list anymore.

1205
01:22:35,121 --> 01:22:36,161
You don't want the list.

1206
01:22:36,163 --> 01:22:37,205
Too many
powerful people.

1207
01:22:37,207 --> 01:22:39,206
Too political.

1208
01:22:39,208 --> 01:22:41,084
It's a coalition of
the fucking greedy.

1209
01:22:41,086 --> 01:22:42,921
No one gives
a shit about Iraq.

1210
01:22:43,630 --> 01:22:45,879
Everyone just wants
the money and the crude.

1211
01:22:45,881 --> 01:22:48,967
Yeah, and that's why
we need to stop Resnetsov.

1212
01:22:50,804 --> 01:22:52,596
And Pasha can
give him to us.

1213
01:22:54,265 --> 01:22:57,894
Michael we have strong Intel
that your boss is involved.

1214
01:22:59,270 --> 01:23:01,646
Pasha's never
gonna help you.

1215
01:23:01,648 --> 01:23:03,942
Well maybe he just
needs a little push.

1216
01:23:05,902 --> 01:23:08,820
And we're hoping that
maybe you can convince him.

1217
01:23:08,822 --> 01:23:10,321
You think I can
convince Pasha?

1218
01:23:10,323 --> 01:23:13,199
Pasha's never gonna do it,
he's never gonna listen to you.

1219
01:23:13,201 --> 01:23:20,248
We can protect the UN
from any unpleasant blow-back.

1220
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:21,208
Diplomacy.

1221
01:23:22,042 --> 01:23:23,084
What?

1222
01:23:23,086 --> 01:23:28,714
Diplomacy.

1223
01:23:28,716 --> 01:23:30,090
Something Pasha
said to me once.

1224
01:23:57,453 --> 01:23:59,956
So now you're the one
working with the criminals.

1225
01:24:01,957 --> 01:24:03,999
It's not the same.

1226
01:24:06,087 --> 01:24:07,172
Why isn't
it the same?

1227
01:24:08,088 --> 01:24:09,921
We have the
momentum now.

1228
01:24:09,923 --> 01:24:12,467
The Kurds are going to be an
important part of making...

1229
01:24:12,469 --> 01:24:14,802
Kurds have been
fighting the same war

1230
01:24:14,804 --> 01:24:16,178
for pretty
much 7000 years.

1231
01:24:16,180 --> 01:24:18,265
You really think this is
gonna change anything?

1232
01:24:20,894 --> 01:24:23,311
Who can say?

1233
01:24:23,313 --> 01:24:26,274
But for sure it's not up to
you to decide that for us.

1234
01:24:28,902 --> 01:24:29,735
Come with me.

1235
01:24:38,578 --> 01:24:40,327
I can't.

1236
01:25:15,948 --> 01:25:17,241
Neonatal medicine.

1237
01:25:18,158 --> 01:25:19,659
Yeah, they're
new vendors.

1238
01:25:19,661 --> 01:25:21,078
French Canadians.

1239
01:25:22,079 --> 01:25:23,161
They want
exclusive rights

1240
01:25:23,163 --> 01:25:24,955
to the whole of
The Northern Region.

1241
01:25:24,957 --> 01:25:27,541
That's fairly greedy,
especially for the Canadian's.

1242
01:25:27,543 --> 01:25:28,543
Well I can...

1243
01:25:28,545 --> 01:25:30,378
They'll need to be
willing to pay

1244
01:25:30,380 --> 01:25:32,421
a hundred grand
to make it happen.

1245
01:25:32,423 --> 01:25:35,049
You, um,
do the legwork

1246
01:25:35,051 --> 01:25:37,218
with the Kurds and the
Provisional Authority,

1247
01:25:37,220 --> 01:25:39,472
I'll handle the
rat, we split fifty-fifty.

1248
01:25:40,097 --> 01:25:41,347
Fifty thousand dollar
pay off?

1249
01:25:41,349 --> 01:25:44,392
No, shekels.

1250
01:25:44,394 --> 01:25:45,351
Christ,
of course dollars.

1251
01:25:45,353 --> 01:25:47,186
What the fuck?

1252
01:25:47,188 --> 01:25:48,398
Thank you.

1253
01:25:50,649 --> 01:25:53,233
Pleasure to see
you again, sir.

1254
01:25:53,235 --> 01:25:56,278
And so much more
favorable circumstances.

1255
01:25:56,280 --> 01:25:57,573
Yes?

1256
01:25:58,783 --> 01:26:01,325
Ah, you must be one
of the Canadians.

1257
01:26:01,327 --> 01:26:02,451
Uh, Cutter, sir.

1258
01:26:02,453 --> 01:26:03,369
No.

1259
01:26:03,371 --> 01:26:05,370
Ah, American.

1260
01:26:05,372 --> 01:26:07,000
I wasn't, um...

1261
01:26:07,583 --> 01:26:09,375
you didn't tell me the
Provisional Authorities

1262
01:26:09,377 --> 01:26:12,128
would be sending someone
for such a routine agreement.

1263
01:26:12,130 --> 01:26:13,545
They didn't.

1264
01:26:13,547 --> 01:26:18,092
We're not exactly here
about medicine, Mr. Passaris.

1265
01:26:19,304 --> 01:26:23,222
They'll need to be willing
to pay a hundred grand

1266
01:26:23,224 --> 01:26:24,184
to make it happen.

1267
01:26:24,641 --> 01:26:28,268
You, um, do the
legwork with the Kurds

1268
01:26:28,270 --> 01:26:30,729
and the Provisional Authority,
I'll handle the rat,

1269
01:26:30,731 --> 01:26:33,482
we'll split fifty-fifty.

1270
01:26:33,484 --> 01:26:35,401
Oh, kid.

1271
01:26:35,403 --> 01:26:36,611
Fifty thousand
dollar pay off?

1272
01:26:36,613 --> 01:26:39,280
No, shekels.

1273
01:26:39,282 --> 01:26:40,490
Christ,
of course dollars.

1274
01:26:40,492 --> 01:26:42,034
What the fuck?

1275
01:26:45,829 --> 01:26:48,291
It's like a surprise
party without the cake.

1276
01:26:51,377 --> 01:26:52,545
What do you want?

1277
01:26:53,462 --> 01:26:56,171
Give us Timur
Rasnetsov, and resign your job.

1278
01:26:57,425 --> 01:27:00,175
Or we'll have to drag you
and the United Nations

1279
01:27:00,177 --> 01:27:02,764
through a scandal
of historic proportion.

1280
01:27:06,935 --> 01:27:11,687
This happens with or
without you, with or without me.

1281
01:27:11,689 --> 01:27:15,357
Rasnetsov is protected by
multinational companies

1282
01:27:15,359 --> 01:27:16,651
who have governments
who protect them...

1283
01:27:16,653 --> 01:27:18,902
same people who just
brought Saddam to his knees

1284
01:27:18,904 --> 01:27:20,780
and put you here...

1285
01:27:20,782 --> 01:27:22,906
holding court,
judging me.

1286
01:27:22,908 --> 01:27:25,660
You think your place at the
table now was not bought

1287
01:27:25,662 --> 01:27:26,660
and paid for?

1288
01:27:26,662 --> 01:27:27,911
We paid
with our lives.

1289
01:27:27,913 --> 01:27:29,080
If that's
what you mean.

1290
01:27:29,082 --> 01:27:31,456
What you call corruption is
simply the growing pains

1291
01:27:31,458 --> 01:27:36,294
of a new democracy.

1292
01:27:36,296 --> 01:27:37,588
And you
are indeed fools

1293
01:27:37,590 --> 01:27:41,509
if you think you can put
the brakes on it now.

1294
01:27:41,511 --> 01:27:44,344
Let's let the
politicians worry about that.

1295
01:27:44,346 --> 01:27:46,474
We will
settle for the rat.

1296
01:27:46,765 --> 01:27:49,392
You want me
to commit suicide.

1297
01:27:49,394 --> 01:27:50,684
We can protect you.

1298
01:27:50,686 --> 01:27:51,977
You know
that's not true.

1299
01:27:51,979 --> 01:27:53,480
Well, just set up
a meeting.

1300
01:27:54,524 --> 01:27:56,609
Give him the envelope
for the Canadian deal.

1301
01:27:57,402 --> 01:28:04,824
We'll catch
him red-handed.

1302
01:28:04,826 --> 01:28:05,827
What the hell?

1303
01:28:44,783 --> 01:28:45,825
Not bad, kid.

1304
01:28:47,534 --> 01:28:48,951
Well played.

1305
01:28:59,838 --> 01:29:00,673
He's late.

1306
01:30:03,610 --> 01:30:04,861
Yes?

1307
01:30:29,636 --> 01:30:31,180
Fucking country.

1308
01:31:35,537 --> 01:31:38,123
Is it okay
if I join you?

1309
01:31:42,252 --> 01:31:44,335
I'll be stepping
down, going home.

1310
01:31:44,337 --> 01:31:45,839
I've lost
my taste for it.

1311
01:31:46,338 --> 01:31:48,382
I wanted you to
hear it from me.

1312
01:31:49,717 --> 01:31:52,345
I've recommended you
for a position in UNESCO.

1313
01:31:53,012 --> 01:31:54,514
Special Assistant.

1314
01:31:55,974 --> 01:31:58,393
You'll be the youngest
one in the whole UN.

1315
01:32:01,479 --> 01:32:02,480
Did you know?

1316
01:32:04,733 --> 01:32:05,859
Oh kid.

1317
01:32:10,070 --> 01:32:11,780
How can even
you think that?

1318
01:32:13,449 --> 01:32:16,368
These fucking lunatics, they're
killing each other every day.

1319
01:32:18,747 --> 01:32:20,164
That's the
truth of it.

1320
01:32:23,667 --> 01:32:25,377
That's your
truth, Pasha.

1321
01:32:27,796 --> 01:32:30,173
And I'm not
part of it anymore.

1322
01:32:31,509 --> 01:32:32,799
Don't.

1323
01:32:32,801 --> 01:32:34,384
Don't do
anything dumb.

1324
01:32:34,386 --> 01:32:36,094
You can't
fight the storm.

1325
01:32:49,985 --> 01:32:52,322
I realized everybody
knew about the corruption.

1326
01:32:53,614 --> 01:32:55,199
They just didn't
want it exposed.

1327
01:32:56,618 --> 01:32:58,785
Every permanent member
of The Security Council

1328
01:32:58,787 --> 01:33:01,495
had something to lose,
someone on the list

1329
01:33:01,497 --> 01:33:03,082
who could
embarrass them.

1330
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,541
It would all
be covered up.

1331
01:33:06,543 --> 01:33:08,671
But the UN couldn't
survive these lies.

1332
01:33:10,923 --> 01:33:12,714
I had to
do something.

1333
01:33:12,716 --> 01:33:16,011
Risk something
to make a change.

1334
01:33:17,221 --> 01:33:18,595
If I tried to list

1335
01:33:18,597 --> 01:33:22,433
his accomplishments
we would be here into tomorrow,

1336
01:33:22,435 --> 01:33:25,769
but in his forty years
of service to the cause

1337
01:33:25,771 --> 01:33:28,690
of world peace and our
humanitarian mission,

1338
01:33:28,692 --> 01:33:31,025
the crowning achievement
would have to be

1339
01:33:31,027 --> 01:33:33,945
his successful implementation
and operation

1340
01:33:33,947 --> 01:33:35,530
of Oil For Food.

1341
01:33:43,581 --> 01:33:45,455
Hi. I'm Trevor Owen
from Oversight.

1342
01:33:45,457 --> 01:33:47,250
I spoke to
John earlier.

1343
01:33:47,252 --> 01:33:48,668
Saddam's Palace Files.

1344
01:33:48,670 --> 01:33:50,503
Right, yeah.

1345
01:33:50,505 --> 01:33:51,754
Which boxes?

1346
01:33:51,756 --> 01:33:53,339
All of them.

1347
01:33:53,341 --> 01:33:55,340
They're sealed to the public,
but as you're from oversight,

1348
01:33:55,342 --> 01:33:58,052
and as long as you don't take
anything with you...

1349
01:33:58,054 --> 01:33:59,055
...go crazy.

1350
01:33:59,514 --> 01:34:00,390
Thank you.

1351
01:34:01,349 --> 01:34:02,932
Mr. Passaris.

1352
01:34:02,934 --> 01:34:04,017
Job well done.

1353
01:34:04,019 --> 01:34:04,933
Thank you.

1354
01:34:06,979 --> 01:34:07,894
Where's Michael?

1355
01:34:07,896 --> 01:34:09,399
He's cleared
his desk, sir.

1356
01:34:12,819 --> 01:34:14,279
I think I found it.

1357
01:34:16,823 --> 01:34:19,281
You know what we're
gonna have to do?

1358
01:34:19,283 --> 01:34:20,616
Fuckin' family.

1359
01:34:58,739 --> 01:35:01,366
My name
is Michael Sullivan,

1360
01:35:01,368 --> 01:35:08,580
and I have a story I think
you're gonna wanna hear.

1361
01:35:08,582 --> 01:35:11,334
These are the raw numbers for
how much money was involved,

1362
01:35:11,336 --> 01:35:14,670
and that is billions,
not millions.

1363
01:35:14,672 --> 01:35:17,298
Jesus.

1364
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:20,802
And this is a list of everyone
who received vouchers there,

1365
01:35:20,804 --> 01:35:21,721
bribes and kickbacks.

1366
01:35:22,846 --> 01:35:26,348
You can corroborate the names
with the deposit records

1367
01:35:26,350 --> 01:35:29,186
right here with the list
of contracts on file.

1368
01:35:34,149 --> 01:35:35,734
This is massive,
Jesse.

1369
01:35:37,695 --> 01:35:39,653
You realize the minute
this breaks

1370
01:35:39,655 --> 01:35:42,031
you'll have
a lot of enemies.

1371
01:35:42,033 --> 01:35:43,243
Yeah, I know.

1372
01:35:43,827 --> 01:35:45,492
We, uh,
we could protect you,

1373
01:35:45,494 --> 01:35:47,495
cite you as a
confidential source.

1374
01:35:47,497 --> 01:35:49,414
No, anonymity is
part of the problem.

1375
01:35:49,416 --> 01:35:52,000
If nobody takes
responsibility for the truth

1376
01:35:52,002 --> 01:35:54,087
then we are leaving it
up to consensus

1377
01:35:55,838 --> 01:35:57,256
I have to own it.

1378
01:35:59,801 --> 01:36:02,009
We begin this evening
with the United Nations,

1379
01:36:02,011 --> 01:36:05,638
the Oil For Food controversy,
and scandal.

1380
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:08,391
And the call on the part of
the United States senator

1381
01:36:08,393 --> 01:36:11,268
for the resignation
of Kofi Annan.

1382
01:36:11,270 --> 01:36:14,062
Obviously these
are serious allegations,

1383
01:36:14,064 --> 01:36:15,063
which we
take seriously.

1384
01:36:15,065 --> 01:36:19,027
The UN secretary general
today ordered an investigation

1385
01:36:19,029 --> 01:36:20,611
of Costa Passaris.

1386
01:36:20,613 --> 01:36:23,947
The former undersecretary
who a whistleblower claims

1387
01:36:23,949 --> 01:36:26,616
was behind the Oil For Food
scandal that has rocked

1388
01:36:26,618 --> 01:36:29,911
the United Nations,
and implicated a long list

1389
01:36:29,913 --> 01:36:32,874
of prominent businessmen,
and political figures

1390
01:36:32,876 --> 01:36:35,084
across the world.

1391
01:36:35,086 --> 01:36:36,796
Incompetent
and corrupt.

1392
01:36:41,091 --> 01:36:43,425
Weaknesses in the Oil For Food
program raises

1393
01:36:43,427 --> 01:36:45,428
serious questions about
the United Nations'

1394
01:36:45,430 --> 01:36:47,722
ability to enforce
sanctions and administer

1395
01:36:47,724 --> 01:36:49,723
a humanitarian aid
program in the future.

1396
01:36:49,725 --> 01:36:51,851
The documents The Telegraph
have come up with

1397
01:36:51,853 --> 01:36:54,353
were reportedly found
in Iraq's foreign Ministry

1398
01:36:54,355 --> 01:36:57,440
in the anarchic
days after the US lead invasion.

1399
01:36:57,442 --> 01:37:00,485
The Wall Street Journal
reports having documentation

1400
01:37:00,487 --> 01:37:02,527
of kickbacks and
bribes in the form

1401
01:37:02,529 --> 01:37:05,865
of oil vouchers
worth billions of dollars.

1402
01:37:05,867 --> 01:37:07,866
But according to
federal authorities,

1403
01:37:07,868 --> 01:37:10,662
Passaris himself
has fled the country.

1404
01:37:33,978 --> 01:37:35,855
I'm with The Wall
Street Journal.

1405
01:37:37,106 --> 01:37:40,942
We're doing a follow up on
the Oil For Food scandal.

1406
01:37:40,944 --> 01:37:43,613
I've come to
get your side of the story.

1407
01:37:43,947 --> 01:37:44,948
I don't
have a side.

1408
01:37:45,573 --> 01:37:46,908
And it's the
kid's fucking story.

1409
01:37:56,751 --> 01:37:58,086
I'm not
running away, okay?

1410
01:37:58,795 --> 01:38:00,419
Make sure
you write that.

1411
01:38:00,421 --> 01:38:03,005
Not hiding
from anybody.

1412
01:38:03,007 --> 01:38:05,799
And yet here you are in
a place without extradition.

1413
01:38:05,801 --> 01:38:07,509
It was difficult.

1414
01:38:07,511 --> 01:38:09,803
Write that.

1415
01:38:09,805 --> 01:38:12,139
Complicated.

1416
01:38:12,141 --> 01:38:14,142
Messy with
Saddam's ugly nonsense

1417
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:15,727
and the usual
first world duplicity,

1418
01:38:15,729 --> 01:38:17,521
but we
did more good than bad.

1419
01:38:21,734 --> 01:38:23,652
I don't care what
anybody fucking says.

1420
01:38:27,782 --> 01:38:29,617
And the
kid did great.

1421
01:38:34,163 --> 01:38:38,460
The choice as I see it
is between cynicism and candor.

1422
01:38:39,002 --> 01:38:42,128
You know if everyone cared so
much about Iraq as they said,

1423
01:38:42,130 --> 01:38:45,548
then this story would
have been celebrated

1424
01:38:45,550 --> 01:38:47,594
as a conspiracy
of saints.

1425
01:38:49,845 --> 01:38:51,138
But the truth...

1426
01:38:53,850 --> 01:38:56,853
the truth isn't about
the lies we told each other.

1427
01:38:59,689 --> 01:39:01,272
It's about the lies
we told ourselves.

1428
01:39:10,158 --> 01:39:11,907
More than
two thousand companies

1429
01:39:11,909 --> 01:39:14,160
from fifty-six different
countries took bribes

1430
01:39:14,162 --> 01:39:16,581
or paid kickbacks
to Saddam Hussein.

1431
01:39:18,123 --> 01:39:20,208
Over twenty billion dollars
got diverted

1432
01:39:20,210 --> 01:39:22,210
from the
Oil For Food Program.

1433
01:39:22,212 --> 01:39:23,919
Implicated were
some of the most

1434
01:39:23,921 --> 01:39:28,049
prestigious corporations
