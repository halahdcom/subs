1
00:00:26,784 --> 00:00:28,827
[man] <i>For 4,000 years...</i>

2
00:00:28,911 --> 00:00:30,454
[continues indistinctly]

3
00:00:35,167 --> 00:00:37,962
<i>...villains and heroes,
and they don't do that here.</i>

4
00:00:38,045 --> 00:00:40,297
<i>Here, you have Jews, Muslims, Christians,</i>

5
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:42,383
<i>all living shoulder to shoulder,
and it's messy.</i>

6
00:00:42,466 --> 00:00:44,760
<i>And the challenge
for the State Department, for us...</i>

7
00:00:44,843 --> 00:00:48,305
[congressman laughs] <i>Sounds like
I'm not gonna get a quick answer.</i>

8
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:50,599
[man] <i>Mason's just playing the diplomat,
Congressman.</i>

9
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:53,310
<i>He's been here long enough
to explain this place in a minute.</i>

10
00:00:53,394 --> 00:00:54,395
[men laughing]

11
00:00:54,478 --> 00:00:58,440
[congressman] <i>Let's have
the shorter version. Give me the snapshot.</i>

12
00:00:58,524 --> 00:01:01,986
[Mason] <i>I don't know if I'd call it
a snapshot, but I tell people,</i>

13
00:01:02,069 --> 00:01:06,115
"If you wanna understand Lebanon, think
of a boardinghouse without a landlord."

14
00:01:06,907 --> 00:01:09,285
The only thing the tenants have in common

15
00:01:09,368 --> 00:01:11,120
is their talent for betrayal.

16
00:01:11,829 --> 00:01:16,959
So these people have been living together,
cheek by jowl, 20 centuries.

17
00:01:17,751 --> 00:01:22,590
2,000 years of revenge, blood feuds,
vendetta, murder.

18
00:01:23,048 --> 00:01:24,550
One night there's a storm.

19
00:01:25,634 --> 00:01:27,720
Raining like hell.
There's a knock at the door.

20
00:01:27,803 --> 00:01:29,888
Who is it? It's the Palestinians.

21
00:01:30,306 --> 00:01:32,433
They want in.
They've been up and down the block.

22
00:01:32,516 --> 00:01:35,102
They had doors slammed in their face.
They're cold. They're tired.

23
00:01:35,185 --> 00:01:37,521
They want in and they want in now.

24
00:01:37,605 --> 00:01:40,316
So the house is thrown into confusion.

25
00:01:40,482 --> 00:01:43,694
Tenants arguing.
Some of 'em violently opposed.

26
00:01:43,777 --> 00:01:46,614
Some think, "Let 'em in.
They'll be gone tomorrow."

27
00:01:46,697 --> 00:01:48,115
Some think, "I let them in tonight,

28
00:01:48,198 --> 00:01:49,992
then I'll have an ally against my enemy."

29
00:01:50,075 --> 00:01:53,245
Some of 'em are terrified
if they keep the door shut.

30
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:55,956
So it isn't until after
the Palestinians move in

31
00:01:56,874 --> 00:01:59,877
that the other people in the house
realize the tragedy of the situation.

32
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,588
That the Palestinians want nothing more

33
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:05,215
than to just burn down
the Israeli house next door.

34
00:02:09,845 --> 00:02:11,347
Welcome to Beirut.

35
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,807
-[congressman laughs]
-[man] I told you he's good.

36
00:02:13,891 --> 00:02:15,768
-[congressman] Sure is.
-[Mason] And so it goes.

37
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,729
-[woman] Mr. Skiles.
-[blows kiss]

38
00:02:19,396 --> 00:02:21,023
[Mason] <i>Ça va?</i> How are you?

39
00:02:21,106 --> 00:02:22,983
[both speaking French]

40
00:02:23,067 --> 00:02:25,653
You look beautiful. You look great.
Mason Skiles. How do you do?

41
00:02:25,736 --> 00:02:27,571
We have not met. How do you do?

42
00:02:27,655 --> 00:02:29,573
Nice to see you again. There he is.

43
00:02:29,657 --> 00:02:32,076
<i>We know who
we don't wanna make deals with.</i>

44
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:34,745
The lessons of Vietnam have been learned.

45
00:02:34,828 --> 00:02:35,996
And I think our president

46
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,249
has got his own things
on the domestic front to deal with.

47
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:44,380
But what we definitely don't wanna do is
establish any sort of permanent presence.

48
00:02:44,463 --> 00:02:46,507
-[Mason] Where are you from?
-[woman] Washington, DC.

49
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,301
Well, good for you. Welcome. Here we are.

50
00:02:49,385 --> 00:02:51,095
[in French] The party is a delight.

51
00:02:51,178 --> 00:02:52,137
Thank you!

52
00:02:52,221 --> 00:02:54,264
[in English] We understand
that Beirut, specifically,

53
00:02:54,348 --> 00:02:56,642
and Lebanon, more generally,

54
00:02:56,725 --> 00:03:00,020
has enough people coming in
and trying to put fingerprints on it.

55
00:03:00,104 --> 00:03:01,438
We don't wanna be one of those.

56
00:03:01,522 --> 00:03:04,233
We just wanna make sure
everybody has a fair playing ground

57
00:03:04,316 --> 00:03:07,277
to contribute
to a stable regional economy.

58
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:08,695
That's what I think.

59
00:03:08,779 --> 00:03:09,822
[Mason chuckles]

60
00:03:09,905 --> 00:03:12,741
The congressman
can certainly speak more to that.

61
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:14,576
Karim, this is some friends of ours.

62
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,079
This is Agnes and Joanne
from the United Kingdom.

63
00:03:17,162 --> 00:03:19,373
Karim's been keeping everybody well-fed.

64
00:03:19,998 --> 00:03:21,708
-Good job.
-[Karim] Thank you.

65
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:23,377
[woman] How old is he?
He looks young.

66
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,711
He's about 13.

67
00:03:24,795 --> 00:03:28,132
He's from one of the Palestinian
refugee camps in West Beirut.

68
00:03:28,215 --> 00:03:31,677
He stuck around,
and he's become a part of the family,

69
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,886
which is very nice.

70
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,013
-My lovely wife, Nadia.
-Nice to meet you.

71
00:03:35,097 --> 00:03:38,142
-[Mason] You know the congressman.
-[congressman] Are you enjoying Beirut?

72
00:03:38,225 --> 00:03:41,103
-We've been having a very nice time.
-Yeah. Yes.

73
00:03:41,186 --> 00:03:44,648
[Mason] I find it's a beautiful place,
full of beautiful people.

74
00:03:44,732 --> 00:03:45,858
[Nadia] Yes.

75
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:48,068
One beautiful person in particular.

76
00:03:48,152 --> 00:03:49,027
[congressman laughs]

77
00:03:49,111 --> 00:03:52,906
[Mason] As a diplomat in the Middle East,
you have to think on your feet.

78
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,409
And the more you do it,
the better you get at it.

79
00:03:55,826 --> 00:03:57,619
When you talk about making deals,

80
00:03:57,703 --> 00:03:59,705
the most important thing
is to keep talking.

81
00:03:59,788 --> 00:04:02,708
As soon as the talking stops,
the fighting starts.

82
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:05,669
You need to come in
from a diplomatic standpoint

83
00:04:05,753 --> 00:04:09,256
and explain to everybody involved,
"This is what we have to work with.

84
00:04:09,339 --> 00:04:12,092
These are the pieces
on the game board right now."

85
00:04:12,176 --> 00:04:15,179
Thank you for being here.
I'm gonna leave you in very capable hands.

86
00:04:15,262 --> 00:04:16,597
I've gotta say hi to somebody.

87
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,182
Thanks so much. Good to see you.

88
00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:21,059
Alice. Alice, all alone.

89
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:24,313
I heard you had congressmen. [chuckles]

90
00:04:24,396 --> 00:04:26,148
You know how that drives me wild.

91
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:28,108
Where is Cal? I could use a hand.

92
00:04:28,192 --> 00:04:29,860
He's coming. Just something at the office.

93
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:31,528
Everyone behaving themselves?

94
00:04:32,821 --> 00:04:34,239
-It's early.
-[Alice chuckles]

95
00:04:34,323 --> 00:04:35,824
Come on. Let's get you a drink.

96
00:04:36,408 --> 00:04:37,785
-Hungry?
-[Alice] Famished.

97
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,995
[Nadia in Arabic] Hurry up, girls!

98
00:04:40,078 --> 00:04:41,163
It's dinner time!

99
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,665
[Mason] Mmm-mmm. Mmm.

100
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:45,334
-[in English] How we doing?
-Good.

101
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:47,586
Christians in one corner,
Muslims in the other

102
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:48,962
and Jack Daniel's in between.

103
00:04:49,046 --> 00:04:50,756
Dinner's close. Everyone here?

104
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:53,467
Cal's late, but Alice said
we should start without him.

105
00:04:53,884 --> 00:04:55,552
-How are you, sweetie?
-[Nadia sighs]

106
00:04:55,636 --> 00:04:56,720
My next life?

107
00:04:56,804 --> 00:04:59,348
-In your next life, you marry a carpenter.
-Mmm.

108
00:04:59,431 --> 00:05:00,432
[chuckles]

109
00:05:00,516 --> 00:05:02,434
[woman speaking Arabic]

110
00:05:05,145 --> 00:05:06,897
[Nadia speaking Arabic]

111
00:05:09,107 --> 00:05:10,818
[Mason in English] Where you been hiding?

112
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:13,070
The drivers out back,
they took everything.

113
00:05:13,153 --> 00:05:14,738
The drivers clean you out?

114
00:05:15,322 --> 00:05:16,907
[in Arabic] They live to eat.

115
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,492
-[in English] There you go.
-[chuckles]

116
00:05:18,575 --> 00:05:20,327
[Mason] Get you reloaded
and back out there.

117
00:05:38,053 --> 00:05:38,971
[Cal] <i>Pardon. Pardon.</i>

118
00:05:39,054 --> 00:05:40,889
-Hey. How are ya?
-[Alice] Hey, sweetie.

119
00:05:41,014 --> 00:05:41,932
Have you seen Mason?

120
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,933
You look tense.

121
00:05:43,016 --> 00:05:45,811
No, no. Just wanna talk
to Mason for a second.

122
00:05:45,894 --> 00:05:46,979
[Alice] What's wrong?

123
00:05:47,062 --> 00:05:48,480
Nothing. I just...

124
00:05:48,564 --> 00:05:52,317
Hello, Karim. Look at you.
Don't you look elegant.

125
00:05:52,401 --> 00:05:55,737
-Don't you think so, Cal?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Very elegant.

126
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,157
I understand congratulations are in order.

127
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:01,201
Nadia told me
you did really well on your exams.

128
00:06:01,285 --> 00:06:02,327
She helped a lot.

129
00:06:02,411 --> 00:06:04,788
But she's not the one
who took the test, is she?

130
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:06,915
You heard about this, right?

131
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,960
Yeah. Very impressive.
Excuse me, I'm just gonna...

132
00:06:16,925 --> 00:06:20,637
[Mason] Hey! There you are.
I was having a nightmare.

133
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:22,764
I was gonna have to babysit
these yahoos by myself.

134
00:06:22,848 --> 00:06:24,850
-We need to talk.
-[Mason] You need a drink.

135
00:06:24,933 --> 00:06:28,020
Too much mingling with congressmen
will make you lose faith in democracy.

136
00:06:28,103 --> 00:06:29,479
Indeed. We need to talk.

137
00:06:32,566 --> 00:06:35,027
Mas, we've been through
a lot together. Right?

138
00:06:35,986 --> 00:06:38,697
And somehow we've managed
to steer around the icebergs.

139
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,823
No, thank you.

140
00:06:39,907 --> 00:06:42,784
Cal, spit it out. We have 25 people
out there waiting for dinner.

141
00:06:43,744 --> 00:06:46,079
I've never come to you
with anything operational.

142
00:06:46,663 --> 00:06:49,333
-We've always been clean.
-What the fuck are we talking about?

143
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:52,252
Karim.

144
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:55,172
It's about Karim.
They want him for questioning.

145
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:57,883
-Who wants him?
-Everybody.

146
00:06:58,592 --> 00:07:02,679
-He's got a brother. Did you know that?
-[stutters] What? No, he's got no one.

147
00:07:03,263 --> 00:07:04,765
Why do you think Nadia took him in?

148
00:07:04,848 --> 00:07:07,726
Rafid Abu Rajal.
They were separated in '68.

149
00:07:07,809 --> 00:07:09,353
Karim came here to Beirut.

150
00:07:09,436 --> 00:07:12,230
Rafid went to prison
for two years in Jordan.

151
00:07:12,314 --> 00:07:13,231
Hold on.

152
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:16,276
Where's this going?

153
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,028
Munich.

154
00:07:19,696 --> 00:07:22,449
The brother left a rental car
outside the Olympic Village.

155
00:07:22,532 --> 00:07:27,788
They've got prints. They've got a witness.
They got this, Mas.

156
00:07:28,914 --> 00:07:32,876
That's Karim and his brother
six months ago here in Beirut.

157
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,044
They who?

158
00:07:34,127 --> 00:07:36,713
There's an operations supervisor
at the bottom of the driveway.

159
00:07:36,797 --> 00:07:37,881
They want him now.

160
00:07:37,965 --> 00:07:39,716
They who? Mossad?

161
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,094
I can help you. I can't make this go away.

162
00:07:42,177 --> 00:07:43,178
So it is Mossad.

163
00:07:43,261 --> 00:07:46,098
-Israel just drops a dime--
-Your people are all over this.

164
00:07:46,181 --> 00:07:47,182
This is bullshit.

165
00:07:47,265 --> 00:07:51,228
The State Department froze
your security access two hours ago. Okay?

166
00:07:51,311 --> 00:07:54,982
Someone talked. It leaked.
It's gotta be now. It's not safe.

167
00:07:55,065 --> 00:07:56,984
Cal, it's Karim for fuck's sake.

168
00:07:57,067 --> 00:07:59,361
You've got the kid brother
of Global Enemy Number One

169
00:07:59,444 --> 00:08:01,279
serving canapes to congressmen.

170
00:08:01,363 --> 00:08:03,073
What are you gonna do?
Drag him out of here?

171
00:08:03,156 --> 00:08:07,327
You think Nadia's gonna go for that?
She just filed papers for his sponsorship.

172
00:08:07,411 --> 00:08:10,163
We just got him a student visa,
for chrissakes.

173
00:08:11,415 --> 00:08:13,875
He's part of the family, Cal.

174
00:08:15,794 --> 00:08:16,837
Not my call.

175
00:08:19,881 --> 00:08:24,136
You go tell your boss that I'll be
down to talk to him in five minutes.

176
00:08:27,264 --> 00:08:28,306
[Cal grunts]

177
00:08:30,392 --> 00:08:32,185
[Mason] <i>Karim, you be honest with me.</i>

178
00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:35,230
If you lie to me, if you hang me up,
I cannot help you.

179
00:08:37,274 --> 00:08:38,358
Your brother.

180
00:08:41,445 --> 00:08:42,487
Is he dead?

181
00:08:45,407 --> 00:08:47,701
-Is he dead?
-When is the last time you saw him?

182
00:08:47,784 --> 00:08:49,202
Is he dead? Is Rafid dead?

183
00:08:49,286 --> 00:08:50,996
He's not dead. Okay?

184
00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:54,124
I need you to answer my question.
When did you see him last?

185
00:08:54,207 --> 00:08:55,125
Months... Six months.

186
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,126
Six months where?

187
00:08:56,209 --> 00:08:57,461
He comes to me.

188
00:08:58,045 --> 00:08:59,129
He comes to you where?

189
00:08:59,212 --> 00:09:01,298
I turn around and he's there...

190
00:09:01,381 --> 00:09:02,382
on the street.

191
00:09:02,466 --> 00:09:04,676
[stutters] On the street.
He's here? In Beirut?

192
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,844
No! In Spain.

193
00:09:05,927 --> 00:09:07,054
He lives in Spain now.

194
00:09:07,137 --> 00:09:08,430
He cooks to make a restaurant.

195
00:09:08,513 --> 00:09:10,098
Why would you lie to me about this?

196
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:11,349
[in Arabic] Why are you angry?

197
00:09:11,433 --> 00:09:15,729
[in English] Okay. I'm not mad at you.
I'm not mad at you. Okay?

198
00:09:15,812 --> 00:09:18,440
I just need you
to tell me the truth. Okay?

199
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:20,901
His passport...

200
00:09:22,069 --> 00:09:24,112
He took a Spain passport.

201
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:25,363
A new name.

202
00:09:25,822 --> 00:09:27,657
He says no one can know.

203
00:09:27,741 --> 00:09:29,659
If I tell anyone, he loses everything!

204
00:09:29,743 --> 00:09:31,161
I promised him!

205
00:09:31,578 --> 00:09:33,497
[Nadia] What's going on out here?

206
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:38,794
Go. Now. Go to the kitchen. Wait there.

207
00:09:39,127 --> 00:09:40,337
What did he do?

208
00:09:40,837 --> 00:09:43,632
I don't know. Nothing, maybe.
I don't know.

209
00:09:43,715 --> 00:09:44,758
I need to handle this.

210
00:09:44,841 --> 00:09:47,677
Go back inside,
make sure dinner gets out in time, okay?

211
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:48,970
I'll be back in a few minutes.

212
00:09:49,554 --> 00:09:50,514
This is bad, isn't it?

213
00:09:50,597 --> 00:09:52,724
It's nothing that can't be fixed.
All right?

214
00:09:57,604 --> 00:09:58,438
[Nadia] Karim.

215
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,650
[in French] Are you okay?

216
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:02,818
What is it?

217
00:10:03,193 --> 00:10:04,069
Huh?

218
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,821
What's wrong?

219
00:10:07,656 --> 00:10:10,867
[Mason in English] I promise
I will have him there. I guarantee it.

220
00:10:10,951 --> 00:10:12,410
First thing tomorrow at the Embassy.

221
00:10:12,494 --> 00:10:14,538
-I'm offering a compromise.
-[Jones] I'm sorry.

222
00:10:14,621 --> 00:10:16,414
I don't have the authority to negotiate.

223
00:10:17,707 --> 00:10:19,876
That's a tough spot to be in. I know.

224
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,128
Been in that spot many times.

225
00:10:21,211 --> 00:10:23,130
There's no reason
why this can't run smoothly.

226
00:10:23,713 --> 00:10:25,048
I just don't see that happening.

227
00:10:25,132 --> 00:10:27,342
-Does he know the situation here?
-I've explained it.

228
00:10:27,425 --> 00:10:30,804
Mr. Riley is not here this evening
in a supervisory capacity.

229
00:10:30,887 --> 00:10:33,140
We thought he might be able
to get the man out quietly.

230
00:10:33,223 --> 00:10:34,182
[Mason] "Man"?

231
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,309
This is a 13-year-old boy
we're talking about.

232
00:10:36,393 --> 00:10:38,061
This child is harmless.

233
00:10:38,145 --> 00:10:40,814
This is not an analysis assignment.

234
00:10:40,897 --> 00:10:44,651
If you can't help me find
a creative solution to my problem,

235
00:10:44,734 --> 00:10:47,737
then I'm gonna ask you
to telephone someone who can.

236
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:50,282
We've lost that as an option.

237
00:10:50,365 --> 00:10:53,660
Then I suggest you retrace your steps
and figure out where...

238
00:10:53,743 --> 00:10:55,871
-[gunshots]
-[people screaming]

239
00:10:55,954 --> 00:10:57,414
[Jones] Jesus! Get out--

240
00:10:57,497 --> 00:10:58,957
[Cal] Wait! Mas!

241
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,626
Mason! Hold it.

242
00:11:02,752 --> 00:11:04,212
[people screaming]

243
00:11:07,048 --> 00:11:08,300
[Cal] Watch out! Watch out!

244
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,761
[Karim] Mason! Nadia!

245
00:11:11,845 --> 00:11:12,929
[Nadia] Karim!

246
00:11:13,638 --> 00:11:15,015
[Karim] Nadia!

247
00:11:15,599 --> 00:11:16,516
Karim!

248
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,475
Nadia!

249
00:11:19,561 --> 00:11:20,437
[man in Arabic] Move!

250
00:11:21,438 --> 00:11:22,439
Get him out!

251
00:11:22,522 --> 00:11:24,065
[in English] Help me, Mason!

252
00:11:26,943 --> 00:11:27,944
Mason!

253
00:11:28,612 --> 00:11:29,571
[in Arabic] No!

254
00:11:30,155 --> 00:11:32,115
[Mason] No! Please!

255
00:11:32,198 --> 00:11:33,199
Take me!

256
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,619
Leave her!

257
00:11:37,495 --> 00:11:38,705
[man] Drop your weapon!

258
00:11:38,788 --> 00:11:40,498
[Mason speaking Arabic]

259
00:11:40,582 --> 00:11:41,875
[Rafid] Come here, Karim!

260
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,336
-[in English] No!
-[Karim] Mason!

261
00:11:44,961 --> 00:11:45,962
[groans]

262
00:11:47,797 --> 00:11:48,798
Karim.

263
00:11:50,216 --> 00:11:52,636
[in Arabic] Drop your weapon!
Or I kill her.

264
00:11:53,803 --> 00:11:55,388
[speaking Arabic]

265
00:11:58,224 --> 00:11:59,768
Please, no!

266
00:12:04,022 --> 00:12:05,065
Please!

267
00:12:09,694 --> 00:12:10,695
[gunshots]

268
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:11,696
[Nadia grunts]

269
00:12:14,824 --> 00:12:16,201
Go! Go!

270
00:12:22,624 --> 00:12:26,044
[in English] No, baby. No, baby. Come on.
Stay here with me.

271
00:12:50,568 --> 00:12:52,946
[reporter over radio] <i>Don't leave home
without that raincoat.</i>

<i>You are going to need it.</i>

273
00:12:54,781 --> 00:12:57,450

<i>tapering off just after rush hour.</i>

<i>And that's your traffic and weather

[knocking]

280
00:13:13,842 --> 00:13:14,843
[officer] Hey, buddy!

281
00:13:16,845 --> 00:13:18,221
You all right in there?

282
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,516
Yes... Yes, sir!

283
00:13:21,891 --> 00:13:25,603
[officer] Well, you don't sound so sure.
Coming or going?

284
00:13:25,687 --> 00:13:29,315
[Mason] No, I'm here. I'm a guest
at the hotel. I was just heading in.

285
00:13:29,858 --> 00:13:33,320
All right. Try sleeping inside.

286
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,681
[sighs]

287
00:14:15,904 --> 00:14:18,740
[Mason] <i>All right, issue number five,
pension attrition ratio.</i>

<i>We worked our way to common ground here.</i>

<i>Number six, ICC indemnity bonding.</i>

292
00:14:31,294 --> 00:14:33,171
Feels like another solid compromise here.

293
00:14:33,254 --> 00:14:36,549
We'll cross-collateralize the premiums
with the safety bonuses.

294
00:14:36,633 --> 00:14:42,764
So, we have fewer accidents, fewer claims.
We have a better package. Everybody wins.

295
00:14:42,847 --> 00:14:44,099
All right, guys?

296
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:48,395
That is six issues
we've taken off the table.

297
00:14:48,478 --> 00:14:50,355
It's important now to take a look back

298
00:14:50,438 --> 00:14:51,856
and realize how far we've come.

299
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,233
Six of ten.

300
00:14:53,316 --> 00:14:54,484
Of nine.

301
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:55,860
[Jerry] You see?

302
00:14:55,944 --> 00:14:58,863
You're back with the overtime?
Again with this?

303
00:14:58,947 --> 00:15:00,490
It's never going on the table.

304
00:15:00,573 --> 00:15:03,284
Both sides have to show
more cards here. All right?

305
00:15:03,368 --> 00:15:05,370
The numbers will tell us
which way we're gonna go.

306
00:15:05,453 --> 00:15:07,288
I'm getting raped here, Mason.

307
00:15:07,372 --> 00:15:10,625
-Prove it. Open your books!
-Open your fucking ears. I'm done.

308
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,669
I'm going back to the office
and starting over.

309
00:15:12,752 --> 00:15:14,421
What do you mean by "starting over"?

310
00:15:14,504 --> 00:15:15,964
I'm going back to my original offer.

311
00:15:16,047 --> 00:15:18,341
-[Dennis] Is that a threat?
-No. Here's a threat.

312
00:15:18,425 --> 00:15:21,261
I'm gonna start answering my phone,
'cause it's ringing off the hook

313
00:15:21,344 --> 00:15:24,889
with guys who would kill to work
for what I paid you thieves 20 years ago.

314
00:15:24,973 --> 00:15:26,850
[Dennis] You don't got the balls
to lock us out!

315
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:28,685
-Let's take a break.
-[Jerry] Try me.

316
00:15:28,768 --> 00:15:30,854
[Dennis] I can have a strike vote
in 15 minutes.

317
00:15:30,979 --> 00:15:31,938
Bring it on!

318
00:15:32,021 --> 00:15:33,648
Let's see this strike!

319
00:15:33,731 --> 00:15:35,733
[men shouting indistinctly]

320
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:42,824
[Dennis] Fuck you, you piece of fuckin'...
Do you know what? Kiss my fuckin' fat ass!

321
00:15:42,907 --> 00:15:44,576
[Ernie] That went well.

322
00:15:44,659 --> 00:15:48,288
[Mason] They'll cool off.
The deal speaks for itself.

323
00:15:49,539 --> 00:15:52,417
Let them sit with it a bit,
let the downside ring in their ears.

324
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,377
In a couple of days, they'll be back.

325
00:15:54,461 --> 00:15:57,338
Where do we stand
with the supermarket thing in Providence?

326
00:15:57,422 --> 00:16:00,592
[Ernie] They took a local guy. A lawyer.

327
00:16:01,176 --> 00:16:02,510
I was gonna tell you this morning,

328
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:04,554
but it seemed like
you had a lot on your plate.

329
00:16:05,138 --> 00:16:06,764
Can I buy you a drink at Foley's?

330
00:16:07,056 --> 00:16:08,725
[Ernie] I've been offered a job.

331
00:16:10,226 --> 00:16:11,394
It's New York.

332
00:16:13,021 --> 00:16:15,106
We're still haggling
over the numbers, but...

333
00:16:16,441 --> 00:16:19,694
That's not why I want to wrap things up.
I'm not bailing on you.

334
00:16:22,155 --> 00:16:23,406
You need a rest, Mas.

335
00:16:24,908 --> 00:16:25,909
Like, for real.

336
00:16:26,701 --> 00:16:29,621
Get some sun. Walk around. Take a break.

337
00:16:31,664 --> 00:16:33,416
You're gonna do great in New York, Ernie.

338
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:35,627
You'll be fine.

339
00:16:54,979 --> 00:16:56,022
[woman] Colonel Ruzak.

340
00:17:01,694 --> 00:17:02,612
...sanctions.

341
00:17:05,865 --> 00:17:07,575
[Gary] It's confirmed. They found the car.

342
00:17:11,496 --> 00:17:13,706
-Pack your bag.
-It's in my office, sir.

343
00:17:14,999 --> 00:17:17,001
[soft rock playing through speakers]

344
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:27,762
[man] Mason?

345
00:17:28,513 --> 00:17:29,973
Mason Skiles?

346
00:17:32,183 --> 00:17:34,686
You might not remember me. Ray Sullivan?

347
00:17:35,478 --> 00:17:36,312
Sure.

348
00:17:37,188 --> 00:17:39,941
You arbitrated a barter for us
a couple years back.

349
00:17:40,024 --> 00:17:42,569
A fiber optics project down in Needham?

350
00:17:43,903 --> 00:17:46,614
-Sully. Of course. Of course.
-[chuckles]

351
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,783
-How are you? I'm sorry.
-No. Relax.

352
00:17:48,866 --> 00:17:51,119
Happens to me ten times a day.
Who can keep track?

353
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:55,748
Yeah. We're just here
negotiating labor settlements.

354
00:17:56,374 --> 00:17:59,919
Just killing time
while both sides cool down a little bit.

355
00:18:00,003 --> 00:18:03,965
[Sully] I know. I spoke to your partner.
He told me you might be here.

356
00:18:05,258 --> 00:18:08,052
I got a wake-up call this morning.
Kind of a fire alarm.

357
00:18:08,928 --> 00:18:12,223
Friends in Washington. Old friends.
Well, mutual friends.

358
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:16,311
They know I'm in the area
and they asked me to talk to you.

359
00:18:18,021 --> 00:18:19,647
American University in Beirut.

360
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:22,734
I guess they had someone lined up
to give a lecture later this week,

361
00:18:22,817 --> 00:18:24,027
and he canceled on them.

362
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:27,488
"Cross-Cultural Arbitration"
was the topic.

363
00:18:27,572 --> 00:18:30,617
So, my friends, your credentials,
your being an alumni and all,

364
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,201
they were hoping you might fill in.

365
00:18:33,786 --> 00:18:34,704
There's a check.

366
00:18:36,998 --> 00:18:39,334
$6,500 and a first-class ticket.

367
00:18:40,043 --> 00:18:43,212
I wouldn't go back to Beirut
if it was the last place on earth.

368
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,007
Flight leaves Logan at 8:45 tonight.

369
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:51,929
It sounds like you got about six hours
to find somebody else.

370
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:54,682
I was told that's not an option.

371
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:57,810
Look, I have no idea
what's happening here.

372
00:18:57,894 --> 00:19:01,522
It'd be a hell of a lot easier
for both of us if I did.

373
00:19:03,358 --> 00:19:05,276
But I was told to tell you that

374
00:19:06,527 --> 00:19:08,404
time is extremely tight

375
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,285
and the agency would be deeply grateful
for your cooperation.

376
00:19:14,869 --> 00:19:17,080
It's a serious request. They know that.

377
00:19:18,998 --> 00:19:20,833
Tell 'em I don't have a passport.

378
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:22,835
They put one in with the ticket.

379
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:31,344
Great seeing you, Ray.

380
00:19:34,055 --> 00:19:35,181
Do me a favor, will ya?

381
00:19:36,307 --> 00:19:39,394
You miss the flight, this never happened.

382
00:19:56,285 --> 00:19:57,453
[answering machine beeps]

383
00:19:57,537 --> 00:19:59,706
[Ernie over phone]
<i>This is the last message I'm leaving,</i>

384
00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:01,082
<i>because this is bullshit.</i>

385
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:05,753
<i>Dennis called a strike about an hour ago.
Maybe you know that.</i>

386
00:20:06,713 --> 00:20:11,342
<i>I'm in New York. Pam has my keys.
I don't know what else to say. </i>

387
00:20:12,093 --> 00:20:13,803
<i>You wanna talk, you know where to find me.</i>

388
00:20:27,608 --> 00:20:29,902
[Sandy] <i>Mason Francis Skiles. </i>

389
00:20:29,986 --> 00:20:31,696
<i>45 years old.</i>

390
00:20:31,779 --> 00:20:34,699
<i>Postgrad at Oxford
in Arabic and Mideast studies.</i>

391
00:20:35,658 --> 00:20:38,536
<i>He comes here in 1962
on a teaching fellowship.</i>

392
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:44,083
<i>He's recruited Foreign Service in '63
for immediate posting to Cairo.</i>

393
00:20:44,167 --> 00:20:47,170
<i>Then Damascus, '65, Tel Aviv '68.</i>

394
00:20:47,754 --> 00:20:50,173
<i>1969, he's reassigned to DC</i>

395
00:20:50,256 --> 00:20:52,967
<i>as assistant undersecretary
for Mideast Affairs.</i>

396
00:20:54,594 --> 00:20:57,847
<i>He marries. He's published.
He's widely quoted.</i>

397
00:20:58,973 --> 00:21:00,475
<i>Kissinger takes a shine to him,</i>

398
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:02,852
<i>throws him a working group
at the Paris peace talks.</i>

399
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:07,023
And in '71 he jumps the line.
He comes back to Beirut,

400
00:21:07,106 --> 00:21:09,734
where he was appointed
deputy chief of mission here.

401
00:21:10,401 --> 00:21:13,780
And his wife... I guess Don
ran that by you on the ride in.

402
00:21:13,863 --> 00:21:16,115
The incident at Skiles' house in '72?

403
00:21:16,199 --> 00:21:18,826
His wife and the Abu Rajal brothers?

404
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,453
I can read, Ms. Crowder.

405
00:21:21,078 --> 00:21:23,164
What I need to know is
where he stands now.

406
00:21:24,624 --> 00:21:28,294
[Sandy] <i>Well, he left Beirut in '73
before the civil war kicked in.</i>

407
00:21:28,377 --> 00:21:31,839
<i>He was the senior trade negotiator
for the Boston Merchandising Council,</i>

408
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:34,133
<i>and then he left there three years ago
to go private.</i>

409
00:21:34,217 --> 00:21:37,428
<i>And now he just has
this small two-man firm.</i>

410
00:21:37,512 --> 00:21:39,013
Mostly local labor issues.

411
00:21:39,096 --> 00:21:40,097
[sighs]

412
00:21:41,557 --> 00:21:44,393
So, from Kissinger to the crapper.

413
00:21:45,394 --> 00:21:47,313
[Sandy] <i>Mm-hmm.
He has a drinking problem.</i>

414
00:21:47,396 --> 00:21:49,273
[Gary] <i>Christ. How bad?</i>

415
00:21:49,357 --> 00:21:51,150
[Sandy]<i> They had to pour him
on to the plane.</i>

416
00:21:52,485 --> 00:21:56,072
Like we've got time for this nonsense.
Talk to me, Don.

417
00:21:56,155 --> 00:21:58,115
He's damaged goods.

418
00:21:59,283 --> 00:22:00,827
Front-runner who stumbled.

419
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,496
But he's manageable.

420
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:07,792
Frank? You knew him when.

421
00:22:09,752 --> 00:22:11,671
Don't play cards with him, Gary.

422
00:22:29,814 --> 00:22:31,023
Take it easy.

423
00:22:40,032 --> 00:22:40,992
[man] Mr. Skiles!

424
00:22:41,784 --> 00:22:43,035
Mr. Skiles!

425
00:22:46,664 --> 00:22:50,835
Bernard Teppler. American University.
Absolute pleasure to have you here.

426
00:22:50,918 --> 00:22:52,503

428
00:23:00,094 --> 00:23:01,178
Welcome to Beirut.

429
00:23:01,721 --> 00:23:04,181
We're thrilled to have you here.
Let me take that for you.

430
00:23:07,226 --> 00:23:09,854
[Bernard] I'll be your liaison
with the university.

431
00:23:09,937 --> 00:23:11,397
Get you where you need to get.

432
00:23:11,939 --> 00:23:15,109
Beirut's changed quite a bit
in the past ten years.

433
00:23:15,192 --> 00:23:17,028
You missed quite the civil war.

434
00:23:17,778 --> 00:23:20,531
My itinerary says I'm staying
at the L'Admiral Hotel.

435
00:23:20,615 --> 00:23:22,909
Yes, indeed.
We've booked you the deluxe suite.

436
00:23:23,326 --> 00:23:25,995
On the shelling side, I'm afraid.
Beachside was full.

437
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:28,914
Why aren't we taking Rue du Nabil?
It's faster.

438
00:23:28,998 --> 00:23:31,208
Rue du Nabil's not good today.

439
00:23:31,292 --> 00:23:34,003
Big car bomb last night.
Many people killed.

440
00:23:34,086 --> 00:23:35,504
Who lit that fuse?

441
00:23:35,588 --> 00:23:38,633
[Bernard chuckles] Well, it's Beirut,
Mr. Skiles. Depends who you ask.

442
00:23:39,216 --> 00:23:42,678
PLO says it's Amal militia.
Amal militia says it's Christian militia.

443
00:23:42,762 --> 00:23:46,098
Christian militia says it's the Druze.
Druze says it's the Syrian Army.

444
00:23:46,682 --> 00:23:48,059
Listen to the radio from Damascus,

445
00:23:48,142 --> 00:23:51,228
it's the Israelis making excuses
to come across the border.

446
00:23:51,312 --> 00:23:53,939
Ask Israel...
Ah, for them it's always the PLO.

447
00:23:54,023 --> 00:23:57,610
Not the PLO. My wife says
it was <i>Gamaeet El Cheea.</i>

448
00:23:58,319 --> 00:23:59,278
What do you say?

449
00:23:59,362 --> 00:24:01,489
[driver] I say we skip Rue du Nabil.

450

[driver] They're checking papers, sir.

453
00:24:07,703 --> 00:24:10,164
[Bernard] Oh, fuck it.
I'm afraid I'll need your passport.

454
00:24:10,247 --> 00:24:13,542
Nothing to worry about.
PLO run a decent checkpoint.

Welcome to the Green Line.

458
00:24:24,762 --> 00:24:27,306
This road divides
East and West Beirut now.

459
00:24:27,556 --> 00:24:30,351
One of the civil war's
charming new landmarks.

460
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,646
Muslims to the West.
Christians to the East.

461
00:24:34,438 --> 00:24:36,899
Not much room for the rest of us,
but there you have it.

Thank you! Thank you so much.

469
00:26:11,577 --> 00:26:13,287

470

<i>% It would make me believe

474
00:26:28,761 --> 00:26:33,599
Mr. Skiles? Mr. Skiles?
Hi. I'm Sandy Crowder.

475
00:26:33,682 --> 00:26:36,811
I'm the deputy cultural attaché
at the Embassy.

476
00:26:37,061 --> 00:26:38,395
So nice to meet you.

477
00:26:40,106 --> 00:26:41,107
What a surprise.

478
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,775
I help out at the university sometimes.

479
00:26:42,858 --> 00:26:44,902
They told me you were here
for the lectures.

480
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:48,656
-I know you just got in...
-Yeah. No, I just... Please. Please.

481
00:26:48,739 --> 00:26:50,574
No, I left my car out front.

482
00:26:50,658 --> 00:26:52,743
Perhaps you'd like to get out
of the hotel?

483
00:26:53,828 --> 00:26:56,622
[chuckles] Oh. You know what?

484
00:26:57,414 --> 00:26:59,792
That's funny. I was just thinking
I could use a tour guide.

485
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:01,126
-Really?
-No.

486
00:27:01,836 --> 00:27:03,379
So why don't we stand here and pretend

487
00:27:03,462 --> 00:27:07,133
while you tell me what kind of trouble
I've gotten myself into.

488
00:27:09,093 --> 00:27:11,178
The ambassador's hosting
a recital this evening,

489
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:13,013
and I was thinking of stopping in.

490
00:27:13,848 --> 00:27:17,101
You're just gonna keep smiling at me
no matter what I say, right?

491
00:27:18,727 --> 00:27:20,104
Why don't I meet you out front?

492
00:27:23,899 --> 00:27:25,901
[instrumental music playing]

493
00:27:27,111 --> 00:27:29,113
[indistinct chatter]

494
00:27:44,086 --> 00:27:46,839
Good God. Mason.

495
00:27:46,922 --> 00:27:48,465
Ambassador Whalen.

496
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,385
It's shocking, I'm sure. [chuckles]

497
00:27:52,636 --> 00:27:53,721
Good seeing you, Frank.

498
00:27:53,804 --> 00:27:57,099
I seriously doubt that,
but I appreciate the effort.

499
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,768
[Mason] Congratulations on all this.

500
00:27:59,852 --> 00:28:01,687
Now I know you're fucking with me.
[laughs]

501
00:28:02,938 --> 00:28:05,024
Why don't you go and find Don?
We'll be right up.

502
00:28:05,941 --> 00:28:08,319
-Uh, flight good?
-Good enough.

503
00:28:08,986 --> 00:28:10,237
[Frank] You get a look around?

504
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:12,907
-[Mason] Yeah. What's left of it.
-[Frank] Breaks your heart?

505
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:15,910
I tell you, Mason.
You missed one hell of a fight.

506
00:28:15,993 --> 00:28:18,746
PLO started tossing bombs.
Government pushed back.

507
00:28:18,829 --> 00:28:20,080
Israel got involved.

508
00:28:20,623 --> 00:28:23,417
And what did we get? 50,000 dead.

509
00:28:24,376 --> 00:28:26,962
City carved up like a goddamn pizza.

510
00:28:27,046 --> 00:28:30,549
And the PLO, they're still here,
hoping the cease-fire holds.

511
00:28:30,633 --> 00:28:33,594
'Cause now we've got Israel
down the road licking their chops,

512
00:28:33,677 --> 00:28:38,098
looking for an excuse to drive up
and show us what great weapons we got 'em.

513
00:28:38,182 --> 00:28:41,310
-Mason Skiles, uh, Colonel Gary Ruzak.
-Nice to see you.

514
00:28:41,393 --> 00:28:43,854
-[Frank] National Security Council.
-[Mason] How you doing?

515
00:28:43,938 --> 00:28:48,442
-Um, thirsty?
-Sure. Uh, bourbon. Neat.

516
00:28:50,069 --> 00:28:51,403
Before we get started,

517
00:28:51,487 --> 00:28:54,698
I want you to know we're all
keenly aware of what you've done.

518
00:28:56,075 --> 00:28:56,951
And what is that?

519
00:28:57,701 --> 00:29:01,580
Coming out here. No notice. No info.
It's been duly noted.

520
00:29:03,415 --> 00:29:08,087
[Frank] I think you know Don Gaines,
our chief political officer here.

521
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:09,129
Been a while.

522
00:29:09,213 --> 00:29:10,422
Long time.

523
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:12,883
Here you go. Have a seat.

524
00:29:19,848 --> 00:29:20,975
Okay.

525
00:29:22,851 --> 00:29:26,939
Wow. Two spies, the White House
and an ambassador.

526
00:29:28,232 --> 00:29:31,610
Maybe one of you can actually tell me
what I'm doing here.

527
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:35,614
Have you talked to anybody
in the area recently?

528
00:29:35,698 --> 00:29:37,700
-[Mason] No.
-[Don] You had a lot of friends here.

529
00:29:37,783 --> 00:29:40,202
-You must keep in touch with some?
-No.

530
00:29:40,286 --> 00:29:42,079
A phone call? Christmas card?

531
00:29:42,162 --> 00:29:45,291
-Where we going with this?
-[Don] It's a simple question.

532
00:29:47,001 --> 00:29:48,419
Who's in charge here?

533
00:29:48,502 --> 00:29:50,212
We all serve the president.

534
00:29:50,296 --> 00:29:52,881
Unless he's the next one
to pop through that door,

535
00:29:52,965 --> 00:29:55,509
why don't you step up
and tell me what the fuck's going on.

536
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:03,559
Three nights ago, an American
was pulled off the street in West Beirut.

537
00:30:04,476 --> 00:30:06,103
The next morning, we got a communiqué

538
00:30:06,186 --> 00:30:09,064
from a group calling itself
the Militia of Islamic Liberation.

539
00:30:09,773 --> 00:30:11,817
Very clean. No rhetoric.

540
00:30:12,276 --> 00:30:14,153
They have the guy, they wanna talk.

541
00:30:15,404 --> 00:30:16,822
They want you to broker the deal.

542
00:30:18,907 --> 00:30:20,826
They asked for you specifically.

543
00:30:21,535 --> 00:30:22,536
Who would do that?

544
00:30:22,619 --> 00:30:23,996
[Frank] We know who it's not.

545
00:30:24,413 --> 00:30:26,373
It's not mainstream PLO.

546
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:28,417
-That's a minority opinion.
-[Frank] Come on.

547
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,503
The last thing they want is Israeli tanks
rolling across the border.

548
00:30:31,587 --> 00:30:33,172
They won't risk something like this.

549
00:30:33,255 --> 00:30:36,884
Right now, we're not ruling out anyone.
Everything is in play.

550
00:30:39,136 --> 00:30:40,429
What is it you want me to do?

551
00:30:41,138 --> 00:30:44,641
You're an experienced negotiator.
Negotiate.

552
00:30:45,225 --> 00:30:48,645
I'm here because some lunatic
pulled my name out of a hat.

553
00:30:49,563 --> 00:30:51,940
Your kidnappers clearly wanna make a deal.

554
00:30:52,024 --> 00:30:55,319
They got back fast. They're responsive.
They're specific.

555
00:30:55,402 --> 00:30:57,112
You have something that they want.

556
00:30:57,696 --> 00:30:59,239
Call their bluff. Tell them I'm out.

557
00:30:59,323 --> 00:31:01,617
Let the downside of that
ring in their ears for a while.

558
00:31:01,992 --> 00:31:05,245
If they bite, great.
You have your first concession.

559
00:31:06,288 --> 00:31:10,459
[scoffs] Honestly, I'm a little surprised.
I thought I'd see Cal here tonight.

560
00:31:13,629 --> 00:31:14,880
Cal Riley?

561
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,716
Cal's the hostage.

562
00:31:22,763 --> 00:31:24,640
[Don] You guys were pretty close.

563
00:31:24,723 --> 00:31:26,558
When's the last time you talked to him?

564
00:31:28,227 --> 00:31:29,395
Jesus. Uh...

565
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,731
Ten years ago? I...

566
00:31:34,149 --> 00:31:35,776
[Don] Radio silence? Nothing?

567
00:31:36,902 --> 00:31:38,278
Yeah, no. Yeah.

568
00:31:38,362 --> 00:31:40,406
[Sandy] We believe Cal requested you.

569
00:31:40,489 --> 00:31:41,490
Based on what?

570
00:31:41,573 --> 00:31:43,033
Nothing specific, but--

571
00:31:43,117 --> 00:31:44,410
No, no, no, no, no...

572
00:31:45,828 --> 00:31:47,704
No, I don't see that happening.

573
00:31:47,788 --> 00:31:48,747
[Don] Cal's my CO.

574
00:31:49,581 --> 00:31:52,084
We run half the agency's
Mideast operation off this desk.

575
00:31:52,167 --> 00:31:54,336
Do you understand what that means?

576
00:31:55,212 --> 00:31:57,131
Yeah. You're afraid he'll talk.

577
00:31:57,214 --> 00:31:58,048
Afraid?

578
00:31:58,132 --> 00:32:00,551
He's been here 13 years.
The guy's a walking playbook.

579
00:32:00,634 --> 00:32:03,554
-At the moment nothing's blown.
-[Gary] That we know of.

580
00:32:04,638 --> 00:32:07,307
This goes bad, we don't even know
where to begin wrapping up.

581
00:32:07,391 --> 00:32:09,601
We're playing the waiting game.
It's their move.

582
00:32:10,769 --> 00:32:13,522
[Gary] So, the question I need answered
from you right now is...

583
00:32:15,065 --> 00:32:19,153
can we count on you to play along
until we get our feet on the ground?

584
00:32:22,114 --> 00:32:24,616
[Don] So, here's our story.
We never mention Cal.

585
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,327
He's on assignment,
and nobody needs to know.

586
00:32:27,411 --> 00:32:31,039
Ruzak doesn't arrive in Beirut
till tomorrow, so you've never met him.

587
00:32:31,123 --> 00:32:32,416
We brought you here tonight

588
00:32:32,499 --> 00:32:35,085
because we wanted to find out
what you're doing in town.

589
00:32:35,169 --> 00:32:37,087
[Mason] This isn't really my thing,
Gaines.

590
00:32:37,171 --> 00:32:39,298
[Don] Sure it is. It's Texas Hold 'em.

591
00:32:40,132 --> 00:32:43,135
Two cards down,
and everything else is on the table.

592
00:32:44,219 --> 00:32:45,679
Just play the reality.

593
00:32:46,263 --> 00:32:51,977
You're a confused 40-year-old widower
in the middle of a long winter.

594
00:32:52,561 --> 00:32:54,062
You're pretending to give a lecture,

595
00:32:54,146 --> 00:32:58,442
but the truth is you don't really know
what you're doing or why you came.

596
00:32:58,692 --> 00:32:59,526
Reality.

597
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:04,072
Your name appears out of nowhere,
and we get real nervous. Reality.

598
00:33:04,656 --> 00:33:09,620
We roll you up for a look,
and you resent our interest. Reality.

599
00:33:10,204 --> 00:33:11,747
So, I'm leaving here pissed off?

600
00:33:12,372 --> 00:33:13,832
Works for me.

601
00:33:13,916 --> 00:33:15,542
What about Ms. Crowder?

602
00:33:16,293 --> 00:33:18,420
Well, it's a widely held belief

603
00:33:18,504 --> 00:33:22,257
that dangling a skirt in front
of a jet-lagged American man of your age

604
00:33:22,341 --> 00:33:23,842
is a high percentage play.

605
00:33:26,178 --> 00:33:27,346
We done here?

606
00:33:27,429 --> 00:33:31,016
You suddenly became really important.

607
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,601
Is that a mistake?

608
00:33:34,686 --> 00:33:37,231
I don't know. Reality.

609
00:33:41,902 --> 00:33:43,737
[Sandy] Gaines was just testing you.

610
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,989
Everyone's under a lot of pressure.

611
00:33:46,532 --> 00:33:49,952
-Isn't that what you're after?
-What's that supposed to mean?

612
00:33:50,035 --> 00:33:52,454
You wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for the action, right?

613
00:33:52,538 --> 00:33:55,123
-You think I'm here for the thrills?
-I don't know.

614
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:58,126
No, you don't.

615
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:02,923
All right, fine. Enlighten me.
What's your story, Ms. Crowder?

616
00:34:03,006 --> 00:34:06,510
I'm a skirt in a car driving
an irritated tourist back to his hotel.

617
00:34:12,849 --> 00:34:14,685
Hey, can we take a quick detour?

618
00:34:17,187 --> 00:34:18,021
To where?

619
00:34:19,106 --> 00:34:21,191
[Mason] I'll show you
where I used to live.

620
00:34:28,282 --> 00:34:29,575
[Sandy] Wow.

621
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:41,587
The PLO had a transmitter up here.

622
00:34:42,337 --> 00:34:46,008
Ten months ago, just before
the cease-fire, the Israelis took it out.

623
00:34:47,801 --> 00:34:48,802
Must have been beautiful.

624
00:34:50,387 --> 00:34:51,305
It sure was.

625
00:34:54,224 --> 00:34:55,183
In every way.

626
00:34:56,226 --> 00:34:59,271
Ski in the morning, swim in the afternoon,
party all night?

627
00:34:59,354 --> 00:35:00,731
No, not just that.

628
00:35:02,274 --> 00:35:04,818
What we were doing
was what we wanted to do.

629
00:35:08,614 --> 00:35:09,823
We were happy.

630
00:35:14,786 --> 00:35:16,705
I'm not sure how that turned into this.

631
00:35:18,832 --> 00:35:19,916
I'm good.

632
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:22,961
Cal still with Alice?

633
00:35:24,254 --> 00:35:26,423
As far as I know, yeah.

634
00:35:27,507 --> 00:35:30,218
-So, where is she?
-They have an apartment in Athens.

635
00:35:30,302 --> 00:35:33,055
Alice moved there with the family
when the fighting started.

636
00:35:33,138 --> 00:35:36,475
Cal stayed in Beirut.
It's impossible with kids here.

637
00:35:37,517 --> 00:35:38,644
She knows I'm involved?

638
00:35:38,727 --> 00:35:40,729
I'm not sure Gaines has told her yet.

639
00:35:41,313 --> 00:35:43,690
-We should head out.
-Hold on. Wait, wait.

640
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:46,443
What's your take on all this? Honestly.

641
00:35:47,069 --> 00:35:50,614
Do you think they want to save Cal
or the information?

642
00:35:50,697 --> 00:35:51,740
That's an ugly question.

643
00:35:51,823 --> 00:35:53,325
You must have thought about it.

644
00:35:53,408 --> 00:35:56,536
I'm too busy worrying whether you're
gonna come through for us or not.

645
00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:01,500
Okay, fine. Just pretend for a minute
that I'm actually gonna do my job.

646
00:36:01,583 --> 00:36:02,584
Who am I working for?

647
00:36:02,668 --> 00:36:05,837
The White House? The State Department?
Don Gaines?

648
00:36:05,921 --> 00:36:06,922
Make Cal your client.

649
00:36:09,091 --> 00:36:11,635
Unless you blame him
for what happened here.

650
00:36:12,219 --> 00:36:13,512
Is that what it says in my file?

651
00:36:14,554 --> 00:36:17,432
Listen, we all fucked up here.

652
00:36:19,184 --> 00:36:20,185
Every one of us.

653
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:29,361
[pop music playing]

654
00:37:01,935 --> 00:37:03,061
Shoot, double up.

655
00:37:06,022 --> 00:37:07,357
[indistinct chatter]

656
00:37:28,378 --> 00:37:30,380
[inaudible]

657
00:37:59,242 --> 00:38:01,077
[Cal] It'll be transported to Paris.

658
00:38:04,164 --> 00:38:05,290
I gotta tell you, Mas,

659
00:38:05,373 --> 00:38:09,377
Alice has been pretty adamant
about going to the service.

660
00:38:12,255 --> 00:38:13,882
[Mason] I'll call you when I get there.

661
00:38:14,257 --> 00:38:18,345
If not now, then maybe we'll do
something later, stateside.

662
00:38:18,428 --> 00:38:19,513
You can tell her that.

663
00:38:23,433 --> 00:38:27,229
I keep thinking that I can take this.

664
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:30,899
-You're gonna be fine.
-Bullshit.

665
00:38:34,069 --> 00:38:37,948
Sooner or later, you're gonna realize
that none of this was your fault.

666
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:41,493
Every time you say that, it cuts me.

667
00:38:42,077 --> 00:38:43,745
Then I'll stop saying it.

668
00:38:48,667 --> 00:38:50,877
-Take care of yourself, Cal.
-Hey, Mas...

669
00:38:51,837 --> 00:38:52,796
Mason.

670
00:38:55,173 --> 00:38:56,341
Mason!

671
00:39:05,392 --> 00:39:06,393
[Bernard] Mason.

672
00:39:08,937 --> 00:39:10,188
Mr. Skiles.

673
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,567
Mr. Skiles.

674
00:39:14,693 --> 00:39:16,570
Mr. Skiles, good morning to you, sir.

675
00:39:21,491 --> 00:39:23,368
[indistinct chatter]

676
00:39:29,332 --> 00:39:32,669
[Bernard] Bloody traffic!
Look, we're already late. She's waiting.

677
00:39:33,211 --> 00:39:38,967
Look, uh, it's the blue Renault
across the street there.

678
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,552
Can you see it? Right there.

679
00:39:41,136 --> 00:39:41,970
Off you pop.

680
00:39:43,555 --> 00:39:44,472
All right.

681
00:39:47,684 --> 00:39:48,768
[Bernard] Mr. Skiles!

682
00:39:48,852 --> 00:39:50,020
Quick as you can.

683
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,617
No, no, no, no, no, no.

684
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,036
[speaking Arabic]

685
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,927
Are you fucking kidding?

686
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:23,053
What?

687
00:40:23,136 --> 00:40:25,055
I'm talking about the card game.

688
00:40:25,138 --> 00:40:26,806
I was told to act naturally.

689
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:28,516
Well, Bashir, your new friend...

690
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,517
The host?

691
00:40:29,601 --> 00:40:31,728
He's the PLO Minister of Commerce.

692
00:40:33,146 --> 00:40:35,482
I didn't get a revolutionary vibe off him.

693
00:40:35,565 --> 00:40:37,192
[Sandy] He's a long way from the homeland.

694
00:40:37,275 --> 00:40:39,194
He's got a house in Spain
and a condo in Sidon

695
00:40:39,277 --> 00:40:40,862
and a Belgian hooker named Sandrine

696
00:40:40,946 --> 00:40:43,490
he keeps in a luxury apartment
in Rue Hamra.

697
00:40:43,573 --> 00:40:45,700
-[Mason] How the hell does that work?
-The airlines.

698
00:40:45,784 --> 00:40:47,410
He's pulling over a million a month,

699
00:40:47,494 --> 00:40:50,997
'cause he's the guy who guarantees the PLO
won't blow your plane out of the sky.

700
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:54,084
You mind telling me
where you're taking me?

701
00:40:54,167 --> 00:40:57,587
The kidnappers called at 6:00 a.m.
They know you're here. They want to meet.

702
00:41:00,799 --> 00:41:02,842
[Don] Sent a comm signal out
about 20 minutes ago,

703
00:41:02,926 --> 00:41:04,636
we just got called back.

704
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:07,180
We've got four million in cash
in the Embassy safe.

705
00:41:07,263 --> 00:41:08,890
There's a Naval cruiser stationed offshore

706
00:41:08,974 --> 00:41:10,642
with a SEAL team on standby.

707
00:41:10,725 --> 00:41:14,104
We've got approval
to retarget the observation satellites.

708
00:41:14,187 --> 00:41:15,855
We've got all the pieces in place.

709
00:41:15,939 --> 00:41:18,525
We just gotta hope there's somebody
worth talking to. Let's go.

710
00:41:19,275 --> 00:41:21,486
You all right?
You look a little jet-lagged.

711
00:41:22,278 --> 00:41:23,113
I'm fine.

712
00:41:27,909 --> 00:41:29,077
[Don] All right, let's go.

713
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:23,381
[speaking Arabic]

714
00:42:29,596 --> 00:42:32,807
[explosions]

715
00:42:32,891 --> 00:42:34,642
[Don] It's the Syrian Air Force.

716
00:42:36,686 --> 00:42:38,688
I don't know what the fuck
they're doing there.

717
00:42:39,355 --> 00:42:41,316
Shit getting closer, though.

718
00:42:41,399 --> 00:42:44,277
[both speaking Arabic]

719
00:42:45,361 --> 00:42:47,030
[man] Hey! Don't move! Don't move!

720
00:42:47,113 --> 00:42:49,491
[in English] Don't move! No, no, no.

721
00:42:49,574 --> 00:42:51,326
[speaking Arabic]

722
00:42:52,577 --> 00:42:55,371
We send in four of ours.
We hold four of theirs.

723
00:42:55,455 --> 00:42:57,791
We finish, we go back the way we came.

724
00:42:59,334 --> 00:43:03,004
All right. We're playing by ear
from here on out, Mason.

725
00:43:03,588 --> 00:43:04,839
Follow our lead, we'll be fine.

726
00:43:05,423 --> 00:43:07,509
Gaines does the talking. Understand?

727
00:43:08,551 --> 00:43:11,346
-Just another pretty face.
-All right, let's go.

728
00:43:51,678 --> 00:43:52,679
[in Arabic] Sit.

729
00:43:54,347 --> 00:43:55,557
We've been waiting.

730
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,060
[in English] He says they've been waiting.

731
00:44:03,857 --> 00:44:05,024
[explosion in distance]

732
00:44:17,036 --> 00:44:20,206
[in Arabic] How may we be sure
that this man is alive?

733
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:21,666
You will trust in my word.

734
00:44:21,749 --> 00:44:23,001
Which one of you is Skiles?

735
00:44:23,626 --> 00:44:25,628
[in English] Now he's asking who's Skiles?

736
00:44:25,712 --> 00:44:27,505
Tell him this isn't much to go on.

737
00:44:27,589 --> 00:44:30,341
[in Arabic] We are concerned that the...

738
00:44:31,676 --> 00:44:33,428
My question remains unanswered!

739
00:44:34,012 --> 00:44:35,430
[in English] I'm Skiles.

740
00:44:36,389 --> 00:44:37,807
[in Arabic] I am curious...

741
00:44:38,558 --> 00:44:39,934
My friends are curious.

742
00:44:40,018 --> 00:44:43,605
How is it that I can help
where others cannot?

743
00:44:43,688 --> 00:44:44,939
No, no, no, no!

744
00:44:45,023 --> 00:44:46,649
I'm not here to answer questions.

745
00:44:46,733 --> 00:44:49,527
I'm here to tell you what must happen.

746
00:44:49,611 --> 00:44:51,946
-[in English] I ask the questions.
-[in Arabic] Sir...

747
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:55,408
Demands can be thrown
through the Embassy window.

748
00:44:56,117 --> 00:44:57,327
We've come to hear your voice.

749
00:44:57,410 --> 00:44:58,703
And to let you hear ours.

750
00:44:59,162 --> 00:45:00,330
[Hussein] My voice?

751
00:45:00,413 --> 00:45:02,665
These men should speak!

752
00:45:02,749 --> 00:45:04,876
This man saw his mother
and sister blown up

753
00:45:04,959 --> 00:45:07,629
two days ago at Barjesh Kjehelem.

754
00:45:07,712 --> 00:45:08,630
[explosion]

755
00:45:08,713 --> 00:45:10,924
Do you know that sound?

756
00:45:11,007 --> 00:45:15,261
The sound of American bombs
falling from Zionist planes.

757
00:45:15,345 --> 00:45:18,264
Perhaps you should ask him
what it is he needs!

758
00:45:18,348 --> 00:45:19,223
Sir!

759
00:45:19,307 --> 00:45:20,600
Enough!

760
00:45:22,268 --> 00:45:23,770
So... Tell us. Tell us.

761
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:29,067
What is the price of our man's freedom?

762
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:30,068
The price?

763
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:33,738
-Where do you think you are, the souk?
-[repeats in English]

764
00:45:33,821 --> 00:45:35,740
[in Arabic] You think
we're selling you lipstick?

765
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:39,202
[in English] Yes, Saiyid!
The market is now open for business.

766
00:45:39,285 --> 00:45:40,578
Come in! Come in!

767
00:45:46,459 --> 00:45:49,045
-[man 1 in Arabic] What have you done?
-Don't question me.

768
00:45:50,129 --> 00:45:51,923
[man 2 in English]
Everything okay in there?

769
00:45:52,715 --> 00:45:54,008
[in Arabic] Take him out of here.

770
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:59,472
[speaking Arabic]

771
00:45:59,555 --> 00:46:00,765
[Don in English] It's okay.

772
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:05,853
Everyone stay where they're at.

773
00:46:06,604 --> 00:46:07,814
[in Arabic] Everything is okay!

774
00:46:07,897 --> 00:46:10,692
[in English] Okay, we'll stand by. Okay.

775
00:46:15,613 --> 00:46:17,073
[man] I apologize.

776
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,868
My friend was old.

777
00:46:21,786 --> 00:46:25,039
He was confused by... anger.

778
00:46:26,958 --> 00:46:31,504
I know when we speak to America,
we need clarity.

779
00:46:32,505 --> 00:46:36,217
We need to choose word carefully.

780
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:42,932
You agree, Mr. Skiles?

781
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:49,147
Have I changed so much?

782
00:46:51,065 --> 00:46:52,358
What the hell is this?

783
00:46:53,526 --> 00:46:54,652
You know this guy?

784
00:46:55,903 --> 00:46:57,155
Yes, I do.

785
00:46:58,614 --> 00:46:59,741
Karim.

786
00:47:00,575 --> 00:47:02,118
Karim Abu Rajal.

787
00:47:02,744 --> 00:47:04,078
You look older.

788
00:47:04,162 --> 00:47:05,329
So do you.

789
00:47:05,413 --> 00:47:07,373
[explosion]

790
00:47:07,457 --> 00:47:09,167
[Karim] I apologize for the circumstance.

791
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:10,960
I'm afraid we don't have
a lot of time here.

792
00:47:11,044 --> 00:47:13,463
-[Mason] You're apologizing a lot.
-[Gary] Jesus Christ.

793
00:47:13,546 --> 00:47:15,214
-What do you want?
-[Gary] What the fuck?

794
00:47:15,298 --> 00:47:16,716
You're gonna let that man fuck us?

795
00:47:16,799 --> 00:47:17,800
My brother.

796
00:47:19,135 --> 00:47:20,470
Rafid Abu Rajal.

797
00:47:21,763 --> 00:47:22,889
He is known to you.

798
00:47:23,806 --> 00:47:24,807
Yes.

799
00:47:24,891 --> 00:47:28,061
I will trade Cal Riley
for the return of my brother.

800
00:47:29,395 --> 00:47:31,147
What makes you think we have your brother?

801
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:33,524
Not you. Israel.

802
00:47:33,608 --> 00:47:35,151
[stutters] Why come to us?

803
00:47:35,234 --> 00:47:37,528
Why go to the son
when the father is so close?

804
00:47:37,612 --> 00:47:38,613
[explosions continue]

805
00:47:38,696 --> 00:47:43,701
You're saying the Israelis have Abu Rajal
in custody and they're keeping it quiet?

806
00:47:43,785 --> 00:47:45,661
I think we would know
something about that.

807
00:47:45,745 --> 00:47:48,706
He was with friend at the border
in the south. Now he's missing.

808
00:47:49,207 --> 00:47:50,708
You understand my offer?

809
00:47:50,792 --> 00:47:53,044
Yes. Straight up, Cal for your brother.

810
00:47:53,127 --> 00:47:55,254
I've explained my terms.

811
00:47:55,338 --> 00:47:57,298
[speaking Arabic]

812
00:47:57,381 --> 00:47:59,217
-[Don] Wait.
-Describe Cal's condition.

813
00:47:59,759 --> 00:48:00,885
Alive.

814
00:48:00,968 --> 00:48:03,429
-[Gary] How do we contact you?
-I trade only with Mr. Skiles.

815
00:48:03,513 --> 00:48:04,347
[Don] Why?

816
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:06,182
Because he doesn't trust you, either.

817
00:48:06,641 --> 00:48:09,727
Hold on a minute.
What if they're not lying?

818
00:48:10,603 --> 00:48:13,731
If they can't find your brother,
come up with an alternative.

819
00:48:13,815 --> 00:48:15,066
[Karim] Alternative?

820
00:48:16,651 --> 00:48:18,986
This is alternative.

821
00:48:19,862 --> 00:48:22,490
[Sandy] A, they killed him
and haven't told us yet.

822
00:48:22,573 --> 00:48:23,908
[Don] For chrissakes, it's Israel.

823
00:48:23,991 --> 00:48:25,952
[Sandy] B, they killed him
and don't know it.

824
00:48:26,035 --> 00:48:28,079
C, they have him and don't know it.

825
00:48:28,162 --> 00:48:30,164
He's been picked up
but hasn't been ID'd yet.

826
00:48:30,248 --> 00:48:32,375
[Gary] The guy they've been hunting
the last ten years?

827
00:48:32,458 --> 00:48:34,502
-I don't think so.
-[Sandy] D, he's hiding.

828
00:48:34,585 --> 00:48:37,296
He's been driven so deep,
his own people don't know where he is.

829
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:42,009
E, F, G, they have him in Tel Aviv
in a cage with a little socket in his ear.

830
00:48:42,093 --> 00:48:43,219
Does it even matter?

831
00:48:43,302 --> 00:48:45,555
You think if they have him,
they'll just let him out,

832
00:48:45,638 --> 00:48:47,557
so he can blow up
another bus full of Israelis?

833
00:48:48,015 --> 00:48:49,100
You got your checkbook.

834
00:48:49,183 --> 00:48:52,687
It's Abu Rajal. Are you kidding me?
He's Munich!

835
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:54,147
There's always a number.

836
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:55,439
Never happen.

837
00:48:55,523 --> 00:48:56,607
It's worth a meeting.

838
00:48:56,691 --> 00:48:59,527
And say what? Tell them about Cal?
We do that and he's blown.

839
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:02,029
We don't say anything,
go in, drop a bomb, see what happens.

840
00:49:02,113 --> 00:49:03,656
Come on, get me a meeting in Israel.

841
00:49:03,739 --> 00:49:04,866
Wait a minute...

842
00:49:04,949 --> 00:49:06,576
You know I can do things you can't.

843
00:49:06,659 --> 00:49:09,203
I don't have to be here
when this blows up. I can play hard.

844
00:49:09,287 --> 00:49:12,165
These are our friends.
You're over your fucking head.

845
00:49:12,248 --> 00:49:13,958
-[Mason] Okay.
-You're over your head.

846
00:49:14,041 --> 00:49:16,627
What's Cal's value on the open market?
That some big secret?

847
00:49:16,711 --> 00:49:19,297
You think Karim is the only one
that knows he hit the jackpot here?

848
00:49:19,964 --> 00:49:21,966
How long do you think
he holds that gang together?

849
00:49:22,049 --> 00:49:24,844
How long before one of those guys
gets ambitious

850
00:49:24,927 --> 00:49:27,430
or pissed off
or does something sloppy or stupid?

851
00:49:27,513 --> 00:49:29,849
I'm sorry, right now your only problem

852
00:49:29,932 --> 00:49:32,059
is getting the Abu Rajal brothers
back together.

853
00:49:32,143 --> 00:49:34,562
And whether Rafid blows up another bus

854
00:49:34,645 --> 00:49:37,857
is something you'll need
to worry about later, after Cal is safe.

855
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:41,444
You don't have time to be polite,
and you cannot afford to be predictable.

856
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:45,948
You need cards to play,
and you need them right now.

857
00:49:46,616 --> 00:49:48,784
<i>So, unless someone else has a better idea,</i>

858
00:49:48,868 --> 00:49:51,829
<i>I say we go rattle the Israelis
before they can stonewall us.</i>

859
00:49:55,333 --> 00:49:57,126
[Roni] <i>I'm sorry, this is a waste of time.</i>

860
00:49:57,710 --> 00:49:59,921
Rafid Abu Rajal? Seriously?

861
00:50:00,922 --> 00:50:03,174
-What's going on here, Gary?
-I don't--

862
00:50:03,257 --> 00:50:05,593
If you don't have him,
it doesn't really matter, does it?

863
00:50:07,303 --> 00:50:10,806
I think it's safe to say that if we knew
where he was, he'd be dead.

864
00:50:11,349 --> 00:50:13,935
And we're saying that he might be
worth more to us alive.

865
00:50:16,312 --> 00:50:18,231
-Why?
-[Mason] We're not here to say why.

866
00:50:19,649 --> 00:50:21,400
We're just here
to see if the market's open.

867
00:50:24,111 --> 00:50:27,114
Is this about you looking
for the man who killed your wife?

868
00:50:30,993 --> 00:50:33,746
-Would that get the ball rolling?
-[Roni] There's no ball.

869
00:50:35,414 --> 00:50:37,583
You came all the way here just for this?

870
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:38,918
-[Gary] No.
-Okay. Hold on.

871
00:50:39,001 --> 00:50:40,544
Hypothetically...

872
00:50:40,628 --> 00:50:42,046
Just for fun...

873
00:50:43,256 --> 00:50:44,423
Let's say you did have him.

874
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:47,385
What would it take?
What's on your wish list?

875
00:50:48,344 --> 00:50:49,387
Sky is the limit.

876
00:50:51,847 --> 00:50:53,015
[Roni] I'm sorry, Gary.

877
00:50:54,225 --> 00:50:56,978
Someday you're gonna have to tell me
what this was all about.

878
00:51:00,398 --> 00:51:02,817
[Gary] I must be out of my mind
for bringing you here.

879
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:03,734
[Mason] Relax!

880
00:51:03,818 --> 00:51:05,861
I can't even think
of all the ways this is fucked.

881
00:51:05,945 --> 00:51:07,280
They're coming back to us.

882
00:51:07,363 --> 00:51:10,574
These are people
I have to deal with every day, Mason.

883
00:51:11,784 --> 00:51:13,494
We're not done yet here, Gary.

884
00:51:13,577 --> 00:51:14,912
Are you drunk or delusional?

885
00:51:14,996 --> 00:51:17,039
We're in play. You need to be ready.

886
00:51:21,877 --> 00:51:23,337
-Back to the airport.
-Yes, sir.

887
00:51:23,421 --> 00:51:26,173
-The curiosity's driving your buddy crazy.
-[Gary chuckles]

888
00:51:26,257 --> 00:51:27,925
You are. You're delusional.

889
00:51:28,009 --> 00:51:29,135
Okay. Put up or shut up.

890
00:51:29,218 --> 00:51:30,761
I say they call before we take off.

891
00:51:30,845 --> 00:51:32,888
If I'm wrong, I'm off your back.

892
00:51:32,972 --> 00:51:36,934
I'm right, in the next meeting,
the one they throw me out of,

893
00:51:37,018 --> 00:51:39,103
you're gonna stick around
and close the deal.

894
00:51:39,186 --> 00:51:41,147
I'm begging you to shut the fuck up.

895
00:51:42,857 --> 00:51:44,775
-[guard] Mr. Ruzak?
-Yeah?

896
00:51:45,192 --> 00:51:46,569
There's a call for you.

897
00:51:50,406 --> 00:51:51,991
[Herzberg] <i>Munich Olympics.</i>

898
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,704
Madrid. 16 Israeli tourists.

899
00:51:59,624 --> 00:52:03,836
A synagogue in Istanbul.
14 victims. Children.

900
00:52:06,297 --> 00:52:10,509
El Al flight 305. 46 dead. Families.

901
00:52:10,968 --> 00:52:14,555
All of this, Rafid Abu Rajal.

902
00:52:22,313 --> 00:52:23,230
So how much?

903
00:52:25,066 --> 00:52:27,109
We know what we're asking.
We don't know the price.

904
00:52:27,193 --> 00:52:30,071
If we had him, we would never let him go.

905
00:52:31,197 --> 00:52:32,823
That's a tough opening.

906
00:52:32,907 --> 00:52:34,033
Is this man deaf?

907
00:52:34,116 --> 00:52:38,120
-I think we're off the track.
-It's a simple question. How much?

908
00:52:38,204 --> 00:52:39,205
We never said we had him.

909
00:52:39,288 --> 00:52:43,834
-Then what are we doing here?
-No! What the hell are you doing here?

910
00:52:44,418 --> 00:52:46,003
-[scoffs]
-Wait for me.

911
00:52:46,837 --> 00:52:47,838
Wait for me.

912
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:09,026
[door closes]

913
00:53:14,532 --> 00:53:16,575
-Hypothetically...
-They have him.

914
00:53:16,659 --> 00:53:20,329
Eh. They won't say.
They're gonna take another look.

915
00:53:20,788 --> 00:53:23,749
He might be "lost" in the system.

916
00:53:24,792 --> 00:53:28,712
[whispers] I think they have him.
I think they have him.

917
00:53:28,796 --> 00:53:29,922
What do they want?

918
00:53:30,714 --> 00:53:33,592
You mean other than to make sure
you're not involved? [chuckles]

919
00:53:34,176 --> 00:53:37,638
Syria has antiaircraft bunkers
all over the Bekaa Valley.

920
00:53:37,722 --> 00:53:40,766
Half of them are decoys.
They want better satellite imaging.

921
00:53:41,517 --> 00:53:42,518
That's it?

922
00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:46,355
Two dozen Syrian targets
they don't have eyes on?

923
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:50,276
Take my word, it's a major piece
of strategic intelligence.

924
00:53:50,359 --> 00:53:52,820
Did you tell them it was Cal,
or did they already know?

925
00:53:56,407 --> 00:53:59,618
Did you really think
they were gonna make a blind deal?

926
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:02,371
Of course I told them.

927
00:54:02,455 --> 00:54:04,665
This isn't the New England
Chamber of Commerce.

928
00:54:05,374 --> 00:54:06,709
You've got us in there

929
00:54:06,792 --> 00:54:09,753
playing good cop, bad cop
with the World Heavyweight Champions.

930
00:54:09,837 --> 00:54:14,592
Look, we got lucky, okay?
But that's the end of the flimflam.

931
00:54:14,675 --> 00:54:17,470
From here on out,
you're our spokesman to Karim.

932
00:54:17,553 --> 00:54:19,555
That's it. End of story.

933
00:54:23,017 --> 00:54:26,687
Now, this is bullshit up and down!

934
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:30,983
Syrian bunkers, my ass.
Those are Russian-built installations.

935
00:54:31,066 --> 00:54:32,318
[Don] We're running out of time.

936
00:54:32,401 --> 00:54:35,237
-[Frank] Are you kidding me?
-[Gary] They just want the imaging!

937
00:54:35,821 --> 00:54:37,072
[Mason] Here you go.

938
00:54:38,282 --> 00:54:39,283
Thank you.

939
00:54:42,953 --> 00:54:45,331
[arguing indistinctly]

940
00:54:47,791 --> 00:54:49,335
Don't say a word.

941
00:54:52,796 --> 00:54:55,716
[Frank] <i>You're talking
about jeopardizing US-Soviet relations.</i>

942
00:54:55,799 --> 00:54:59,011
[Gary] <i>That's why
Washington's gonna be making decisions.</i>

943
00:54:59,094 --> 00:55:02,515
<i>We spoke with the minister, Frank.
He was very direct.</i>

944
00:55:02,598 --> 00:55:05,643
<i>They give us Abu Rajal,
we give them satellite pictures...</i>

945
00:55:05,726 --> 00:55:07,728
[Frank] <i>Those pictures are the only thing</i>

946
00:55:07,811 --> 00:55:10,606
<i>keeping the Israelis
from crossing the border.</i>

947
00:55:10,689 --> 00:55:11,732
[Gary] <i>Little dramatic.</i>

948
00:55:11,815 --> 00:55:13,484
[Frank] You take away those rockets

949
00:55:13,567 --> 00:55:17,446
and the Israeli Air Force does
whatever they want to up here.

950
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:19,031
<i>You give them that intel,</i>

951
00:55:19,114 --> 00:55:22,493
<i>we might as well hand the PLO
their life preservers tonight.</i>

952
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:25,955
-<i>You think Riley's worth that?</i>
-[Don] <i>Come on, guys.</i>

953
00:55:26,038 --> 00:55:28,332
-<i>Are you serious?</i>
-[Frank] Y<i>ou like this, don't you, Gary?</i>

954
00:55:28,999 --> 00:55:30,459
<i>Two birds? One stone?</i>

955
00:55:31,043 --> 00:55:33,879
You've been trying to push
an Israeli invasion along for months.

956
00:55:33,963 --> 00:55:36,549
You might want to check with your boss.

957
00:55:36,632 --> 00:55:39,593
-I'm not the Christmas help.
-I'll be calling the Secretary.

958
00:55:39,677 --> 00:55:42,388
-<i>Do what you have to do.</i>
-[Frank] <i>Count on it.</i>

959
00:55:44,348 --> 00:55:46,267
See what you been missing around here?

960
00:55:47,476 --> 00:55:49,270
We're putting a plan in place.

961
00:55:49,853 --> 00:55:52,606
Well, we're in play. That's the good news.

962
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:54,233
Let's see what comes back.

963
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:56,861
Did you get a chance to tell him?

964
00:55:59,029 --> 00:56:02,658
Alice is in town.
She flew in from Athens this morning.

965
00:56:03,742 --> 00:56:05,077
<i>She's obviously upset.</i>

966
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:09,331
<i>She's gone back to their old apartment,
which is no longer a safe neighborhood.</i>

967
00:56:14,378 --> 00:56:15,796
<i>We need to get her out of there.</i>

968
00:56:29,810 --> 00:56:30,811
He's on his way.

969
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:50,414
-[knock at door]
-Ma'am, Skiles is here.

970
00:56:58,339 --> 00:56:59,340
Alice.

971
00:57:18,108 --> 00:57:19,318
[Mason] If that's for me...

972
00:57:20,778 --> 00:57:21,779
No?

973
00:57:24,156 --> 00:57:25,616
It's warm anyway.

974
00:57:28,077 --> 00:57:30,079
They've had the electricity off all day.

975
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:33,749
Don Gaines told me you were an alcoholic.

976
00:57:35,084 --> 00:57:36,543
Guess that makes sense.

977
00:57:37,711 --> 00:57:39,380
God knows what he says about me.

978
00:57:43,592 --> 00:57:47,137
I know it's a lot to take in right now.

979
00:57:48,597 --> 00:57:50,516
I know they want me out of here.

980
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:52,893
You've got the girls to think about.

981
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:57,231
You say that as if you know them.

982
00:58:00,818 --> 00:58:03,320
The girls are fine.
They're living with my parents...

983
00:58:03,904 --> 00:58:06,824
in blissful ignorance of all things adult.

984
00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:11,578
Do you think Cal's still alive?

985
00:58:13,455 --> 00:58:14,456
I do.

986
00:58:16,625 --> 00:58:20,587
People seem very motivated.

987
00:58:20,671 --> 00:58:22,756
How they seem? In Beirut? [scoffs]

988
00:58:24,341 --> 00:58:27,011
Most of the people you're talking to
would love to see him disappear.

989
00:58:27,845 --> 00:58:29,054
People like who?

990
00:58:29,722 --> 00:58:31,932
Cal thought he'd earned the right
to have an opinion.

991
00:58:32,850 --> 00:58:36,562
You'd think someone with so many secrets
would be able to keep their mouth shut.

992
00:58:37,438 --> 00:58:39,189
-About what?
-Seriously?

993
00:58:39,773 --> 00:58:41,358
Israel will fail here.

994
00:58:42,151 --> 00:58:45,320
They'll drown,
like everyone who came before them.

995
00:58:45,404 --> 00:58:47,573
Just don't dare say it out loud.

996
00:58:47,656 --> 00:58:50,034
-Is that what he's done?
-Oh, for chrissake.

997
00:58:50,117 --> 00:58:52,828
Look, Alice, I'm doing everything I can.

998
00:58:52,911 --> 00:58:54,997
-To do what?
-To save him.

999
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:57,624
Well, you've proven you can crush him.

1000
00:58:58,459 --> 00:59:00,544
Bringing him back to life
may be a little harder.

1001
00:59:05,049 --> 00:59:06,508
Oh, God, this place.

1002
00:59:07,551 --> 00:59:08,969
Staying here...

1003
00:59:10,429 --> 00:59:12,556
All the things we might've done.

1004
00:59:15,392 --> 00:59:17,186
We could've gone anywhere.

1005
00:59:19,354 --> 00:59:21,607
You, know, I think really, in the end,

1006
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:25,819
he's been waiting for you to come back
and tell him it's okay to leave.

1007
00:59:27,321 --> 00:59:28,572
And here you are.

1008
00:59:29,948 --> 00:59:31,283
But it's too late.

1009
00:59:32,826 --> 00:59:35,204
You can tell them I'm leaving tonight.

1010
00:59:35,287 --> 00:59:36,872
And you owe me a favor.

1011
00:59:37,998 --> 00:59:41,043
When you left Beirut, I packed your house.

1012
00:59:41,877 --> 00:59:46,381
Dishes, papers, Nadia's clothes,
all of it...

1013
00:59:47,174 --> 00:59:51,136
Cal doesn't make it out of here,
you pack this place up for me.

1014
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:52,638
I think that's fair.

1015
01:00:00,896 --> 01:00:02,189
She's ready to go.

1016
01:00:03,649 --> 01:00:06,193
-He's on his way down.
-[Sandy over radio]<i> Copy.</i>

1017
01:00:19,456 --> 01:00:20,874
[boy] <i>Monsieur</i> Skiles.

1018
01:00:34,805 --> 01:00:35,931
[in Arabic] Come, come!

1019
01:00:36,014 --> 01:00:39,017
We don't have a lot of time.

1020
01:00:43,605 --> 01:00:45,023
[in English] He's on his way?

1021
01:00:45,107 --> 01:00:47,317
[man over radio] <i>Yeah.
He's coming to you.</i>

1022
01:00:47,401 --> 01:00:50,654
[boy speaking Arabic]

1023
01:00:50,737 --> 01:00:51,947
[Sandy] Mason?

1024
01:00:53,824 --> 01:00:54,825
Mason?

1025
01:01:12,634 --> 01:01:14,178
[Mason and boy speaking Arabic]

1026
01:01:17,764 --> 01:01:19,808
[in French] He disappeared. Let's move.

1027
01:01:22,394 --> 01:01:23,395
[in Arabic] Slow down!

1028
01:01:24,730 --> 01:01:26,690
[in English] Get her out of there
right now.

1029
01:01:26,773 --> 01:01:27,649
[speaking French]

1030
01:01:28,192 --> 01:01:29,026
Fuck.

1031
01:01:34,489 --> 01:01:35,824
[Mason in Arabic] Slow down.

1032
01:01:38,994 --> 01:01:40,329
Follow me!

1033
01:01:44,791 --> 01:01:46,168
[speaking Arabic]

1034
01:01:49,588 --> 01:01:51,131
No, no further.

1035
01:01:53,467 --> 01:01:54,384
Stop!

1036
01:01:56,303 --> 01:01:57,304
Stop!

1037
01:01:58,347 --> 01:01:59,556
Stop!

1038
01:02:02,434 --> 01:02:04,186
[shouting indistinctly]

1039
01:02:07,481 --> 01:02:08,482
[in English] No.

1040
01:02:10,359 --> 01:02:11,777
[Karim in Arabic] Get in!

1041
01:02:23,455 --> 01:02:25,457
[breathing heavily]

1042
01:02:32,714 --> 01:02:34,007
[in English] You went to Israel.

1043
01:02:34,091 --> 01:02:37,010
Yes, Karim, they said maybe they have him.

1044
01:02:37,094 --> 01:02:38,971
-So, now we're waiting.
-What? Maybe?

1045
01:02:39,054 --> 01:02:40,055
You wait for them?

1046
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:41,848
Bullshit! You wait for nothing!

1047
01:02:41,932 --> 01:02:44,393
-You... Shut up!
-We are trying. They know it's important.

1048
01:02:45,686 --> 01:02:48,605
You have to tell them to make it work!

1049
01:02:48,689 --> 01:02:52,150
Karim, I got back two hours ago!
We are trying.

1050
01:02:52,234 --> 01:02:53,485
[in Arabic] Find a stop.

1051
01:02:53,568 --> 01:02:55,362
-[in English] I need to see Cal.
-Impossible.

1052
01:02:55,445 --> 01:02:57,447
I need to see Cal and speak to him.

1053
01:02:57,531 --> 01:02:58,615
Find Rafid first.

1054
01:02:58,699 --> 01:03:00,951
-If I had your brother, I'd let you talk.
-Impossible.

1055
01:03:01,034 --> 01:03:02,828
It's only impossible if he's dead.

1056
01:03:04,204 --> 01:03:05,205
[in Arabic] Get out.

1057
01:03:05,289 --> 01:03:07,100
[in English] Are you kidding me?
I'm supposed to trust you now?

1058
01:03:08,083 --> 01:03:09,334
[in Arabic] Get out!

1059
01:03:09,418 --> 01:03:11,044
[in English] You're the reason I'm here!

1060
01:03:12,462 --> 01:03:14,715
I gave my life up to protect you!

1061
01:03:17,551 --> 01:03:18,427
[in Arabic] Get out!

1062
01:03:18,844 --> 01:03:22,764
[in English] Listen to me very closely
if you want to see your brother again.

1063
01:03:22,848 --> 01:03:25,684
I don't make a move until I talk to Cal.

1064
01:03:26,268 --> 01:03:27,185
[shouts in Arabic]

1065
01:03:27,894 --> 01:03:29,771
[grunts]

1066
01:03:33,567 --> 01:03:34,568
[crying]

1067
01:03:47,706 --> 01:03:48,957
We don't have him.

1068
01:03:51,043 --> 01:03:51,877
What?

1069
01:03:52,294 --> 01:03:53,670
-We looked.
-No.

1070
01:03:54,421 --> 01:03:55,547
We don't have him.

1071
01:03:57,799 --> 01:04:01,053
-The wheels are in motion, Roni.
-Oh, we should worry?

1072
01:04:01,136 --> 01:04:04,222
You wait three days to tell us
Cal Riley is a hostage?

1073
01:04:04,306 --> 01:04:06,725
What if he talks?
We might have people in danger now.

1074
01:04:07,351 --> 01:04:10,228
[Gary] Without Abu Rajal,
this doesn't give me many options.

1075
01:04:10,312 --> 01:04:13,523
-[Roni] Work with what you have.
-And what do I have? Say it.

1076
01:04:13,607 --> 01:04:15,942
You had the whole ride up
to think about it.

1077
01:04:16,026 --> 01:04:17,652
You know what I want, Gary.

1078
01:04:17,736 --> 01:04:18,945
Say it.

1079
01:04:21,114 --> 01:04:22,866
Make this the moment.

1080
01:04:23,116 --> 01:04:25,369
Make Riley the breaking point.

1081
01:04:26,578 --> 01:04:31,500
"US Embassy staff grabbed off the streets,
kidnapped, killed.

1082
01:04:32,209 --> 01:04:36,171
The monsters have taken over Lebanon.
Something needs to be done."

1083
01:04:36,755 --> 01:04:39,674
Give us the green light.
We could clear this place out in a month.

1084
01:04:39,758 --> 01:04:43,178
[stutters] Just burn Cal
and give Israel the keys to the city?

1085
01:04:43,261 --> 01:04:44,471
We should worry for him?

1086
01:04:44,554 --> 01:04:48,558
-He's been a thorn in our side for years.
-Cal's network? His assets?

1087
01:04:49,101 --> 01:04:51,812
You think the agency's
just gonna throw all that away?

1088
01:04:51,895 --> 01:04:53,855
If he's not back soon,
they won't have a choice.

1089
01:04:54,773 --> 01:04:55,774
[Gary] Oh, God.

1090
01:04:55,857 --> 01:04:57,484
You've got lemons, Gary.

1091
01:04:58,110 --> 01:04:59,236
Make some lemonade.

1092
01:05:01,196 --> 01:05:03,198
[indistinct chatter]

1093
01:05:12,416 --> 01:05:15,335
You have any idea how many people
we have looking for you?

1094
01:05:16,253 --> 01:05:17,712
Obviously, not enough.

1095
01:05:19,756 --> 01:05:22,342
This kid, the messenger, says what?
"Follow me"?

1096
01:05:22,426 --> 01:05:26,179
He gave me a note.
It had one word on it. "Karim."

1097
01:05:26,263 --> 01:05:28,098
I didn't have a lot of time
to make a decision.

1098
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:31,560
-No one shows up?
-No, the kid bails on me.

1099
01:05:31,643 --> 01:05:33,812
I fall down, walk back here.

1100
01:05:33,895 --> 01:05:36,148
I didn't see anybody out there
looking for me.

1101
01:05:36,731 --> 01:05:38,066
[in French] I'm not staying.

1102
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:40,360
Another one for me, please.

1103
01:05:44,906 --> 01:05:46,158
[in English] Take off your belt.

1104
01:05:47,033 --> 01:05:47,868
What?

1105
01:05:47,951 --> 01:05:49,286
Under the table.

1106
01:05:50,704 --> 01:05:52,414
I'm giving you a new belt.

1107
01:05:54,374 --> 01:05:55,459
A transmitter?

1108
01:05:56,710 --> 01:05:58,462
I can't lose you again.

1109
01:06:03,508 --> 01:06:04,593
Now, do us both a favor.

1110
01:06:05,177 --> 01:06:08,430
You're speaking at the university
tomorrow, so make that your nightcap.

1111
01:06:09,014 --> 01:06:10,515
And get something to eat.

1112
01:06:20,025 --> 01:06:21,026
<i>Merci.</i>

1113
01:06:32,496 --> 01:06:34,498
[Gary] <i>We're five days
and counting, Gaines.</i>

1114
01:06:35,665 --> 01:06:38,710
How much longer can you wait
before you start pulling Cal's people?

1115
01:06:39,628 --> 01:06:41,755
-[Don] I don't know.
-[Gary] You don't know?

1116
01:06:42,339 --> 01:06:43,590
What if this is all bullshit,

1117
01:06:43,673 --> 01:06:46,092
and they've been working Cal over
from the start?

1118
01:06:46,676 --> 01:06:47,969
That's Mossad talking.

1119
01:06:48,053 --> 01:06:50,597
Fuck that, it's common sense.

1120
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:52,390
But I hate to say it, Gaines,

1121
01:06:52,474 --> 01:06:53,308
Cal talks...

1122
01:06:54,351 --> 01:06:57,270
you want to be waiting for bodies
to pile up on the Embassy sidewalk?

1123
01:06:59,523 --> 01:07:01,274
Tel Aviv loves this, don't they?

1124
01:07:01,358 --> 01:07:05,779
We're gonna lose every asset we've got.
They'll be the only game left in town.

1125
01:07:05,862 --> 01:07:07,322
It's a tough decision,

1126
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:10,617
but I need to know
you're thinking about it clearly.

1127
01:07:14,204 --> 01:07:15,914
Just give me 12 more hours.

1128
01:07:17,749 --> 01:07:19,084
Maybe we'll get lucky.

1129
01:07:22,128 --> 01:07:23,922
<i>What the hell are we gonna do with Skiles?</i>

1130
01:07:24,673 --> 01:07:27,050
[Gary] <i>Do with him? He's a drunk.</i>

1131
01:07:28,134 --> 01:07:30,095
<i>He's got the belt now,
so keep an eye on him.</i>

1132
01:07:32,097 --> 01:07:34,641
<i>He fucks anything up, well...</i>

1133
01:07:34,724 --> 01:07:36,560
it's always good to have someone to blame.

1134
01:07:38,895 --> 01:07:40,272
[people laughing]

1135
01:07:40,355 --> 01:07:44,818
Thank you. Yes, and next question. You.

1136
01:07:44,901 --> 01:07:48,446
With the striped shirt and the glasses.
And do speak up. Don't be shy.

1137
01:07:48,530 --> 01:07:49,531
Mr. Skiles,

1138
01:07:49,614 --> 01:07:52,576
you worked on the Paris peace talks
when you were very young.

1139
01:07:52,659 --> 01:07:54,160
Was that your first negotiation?

1140
01:07:55,495 --> 01:07:56,871
Uh...

1141
01:07:56,955 --> 01:07:58,707
My first? No.

1142
01:07:59,249 --> 01:08:01,876
No, not by a long shot. Uh...

1143
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:05,922
I was raised as an only child
in a very small home with two people

1144
01:08:06,006 --> 01:08:09,050
who basically hated each other
just enough to stay together.

1145
01:08:09,134 --> 01:08:10,051
[all laughing]

1146
01:08:10,135 --> 01:08:14,222
So, I guess you could say I've been
mediating since before I was born.

1147
01:08:15,098 --> 01:08:19,311
So, to give you some kind of context,
when I was about nine years old,

1148
01:08:20,228 --> 01:08:22,230
[through speakers]<i> one night
my father came home</i>

1149
01:08:22,314 --> 01:08:23,690
<i>from one of his girlfriends' house.</i>

1150
01:08:23,773 --> 01:08:27,068
<i>And my mother served him
for dinner that night</i>

1151
01:08:27,152 --> 01:08:29,613
<i>about a dozen of his best racing pigeons.</i>

1152
01:08:29,696 --> 01:08:31,448
[chuckles]

1153
01:08:31,531 --> 01:08:32,907
It would be about ten more years

1154
01:08:32,991 --> 01:08:35,493
before I heard the term
"Mutually Assured Destruction,"

1155
01:08:35,577 --> 01:08:39,748
but rest assured, I was very familiar
with it growing up in that--

1156
01:08:40,415 --> 01:08:41,625
[people screaming]

1157
01:08:41,708 --> 01:08:43,418

Go, go! Go!
[in French] Look for channel 5!

1159
01:08:55,889 --> 01:08:57,724
[man in English] No, channel 6.

1160
01:08:57,807 --> 01:09:00,060
-[in English] Get me my beacon.
-Working on it.

1161
01:09:05,190 --> 01:09:07,192
[man] Let me help you, sir. Mr. Teppler.

1162
01:09:13,740 --> 01:09:16,159
The pharmacy Jumblatt! Jumblatt!

1163
01:09:16,242 --> 01:09:17,160
What?

1164
01:09:17,243 --> 01:09:19,829
Jumblatt near the Druze cemetery!

1165
01:09:19,913 --> 01:09:21,164
Pharmacy Jumblatt!

1166
01:09:21,247 --> 01:09:22,791
You leave now. Alone.

1167
01:09:22,874 --> 01:09:26,044
-You understand? You need to go now!
-Yes! Yes!

1168
01:09:27,587 --> 01:09:28,963
I need Crowder on the line now.

1169
01:09:29,047 --> 01:09:32,008
[comm boss] Crowder's in a van outside.
Pick it up. Line two.

1170
01:09:33,301 --> 01:09:35,136
Sandy? What happened? Where's Skiles?

1171
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:36,638
I have no idea. Unknown.

1172
01:09:36,721 --> 01:09:37,931
Where the hell's my beacon?

1173
01:09:38,014 --> 01:09:40,016
I can't get a fix. We have to move.

1174
01:09:47,190 --> 01:09:48,274
Hey, where is he?

1175
01:09:48,358 --> 01:09:50,068
He's gone. He's gone.

1176
01:09:50,902 --> 01:09:54,072
-[in French] He disappeared.
-We're going to leave.

1177
01:09:54,739 --> 01:09:55,949
[in English] We're on the move.

1178
01:09:56,032 --> 01:09:57,450
Do not lose him!

1179
01:09:58,201 --> 01:10:01,037
Shit! Skiles is MIA.

1180
01:10:01,121 --> 01:10:03,748
-Missing or taken?
-I don't know, but he's got the belt.

1181
01:10:03,832 --> 01:10:07,377
-I want that signal relayed in here!
-[comm boss] Yes, sir. I'm on it.

1182
01:10:08,336 --> 01:10:10,380
-Let's get a flag up for the Ops team.
-Got it.

1183
01:10:10,463 --> 01:10:13,466
Ethan, get me a line
to the SEALs Ops team.

1184
01:10:36,448 --> 01:10:38,074
It's not safe here, friend.

1185
01:10:40,034 --> 01:10:41,286

Don't move.

1190
01:12:08,748 --> 01:12:09,791
Put this on.

1191
01:12:18,258 --> 01:12:21,678
[man in English] Okay, 300 yards.
Straight ahead. Signal's good.

1192
01:12:21,761 --> 01:12:25,306
Three hundred yards. Clear signal.
Signal's locking in.

1193
01:12:25,390 --> 01:12:28,101
They're moving southwest 200 yards.

1194

[Sandy in French] Go left
on Rue de l'Armée!

Let's go, search him.

1202

[in English] Get me an address.

-Gaines, come here.

-We're sending them in?
-Mmm-hmm.

1205

[Mason] Hey, Cal.

1216
01:14:31,224 --> 01:14:33,726
You're not hallucinating. It's Mason.

1217
01:14:34,477 --> 01:14:36,604
Are you okay? You look okay.

1218

[breathing heavily]

1219
01:14:38,523 --> 01:14:41,067
I'm here to help you,
but we don't have a lot of time.

1220
01:14:41,150 --> 01:14:42,276
We gotta work quick.

1221
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:46,197
-Mason, how did you get here?
-Stop. Listen to me. All right?

1222
01:14:46,489 --> 01:14:48,992
Now, Rafid Abu Rajal is missing.

1223
01:14:49,993 --> 01:14:52,412
And we're trying to make a trade for you.

1224
01:14:54,330 --> 01:14:55,707
-The brother?
-Yes.

1225
01:14:56,332 --> 01:14:58,876
They asked me to come and make a deal.

1226
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:02,672
Now I want you to listen to me
very carefully.

1227
01:15:03,506 --> 01:15:06,300
They sent me to Israel to try to find him.

1228
01:15:07,468 --> 01:15:09,929
You know how wild it can get there,

1229
01:15:10,013 --> 01:15:12,306
and you have to goose things
along sometimes

1230
01:15:12,390 --> 01:15:14,767
and chase things you don't wanna chase.

1231
01:15:14,851 --> 01:15:16,853
Israel? No, no, that's not who--

1232
01:15:16,936 --> 01:15:18,730
Karim has been very patient.

1233
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:21,149
Karim's been very patient.

1234
01:15:23,067 --> 01:15:24,485
But your friends...

1235
01:15:25,069 --> 01:15:26,362
Your friends at the Embassy...

1236
01:15:28,197 --> 01:15:29,407
They like this idea.

1237
01:15:33,536 --> 01:15:34,370
Yeah.

1238
01:15:37,165 --> 01:15:39,500
I don't have many friends as I used to.

1239
01:15:39,584 --> 01:15:41,335
Okay, you can see everything's okay.

1240
01:15:41,836 --> 01:15:43,588
I think we all need friends.

1241
01:15:44,714 --> 01:15:49,135
Cal, I know I could use a friend.
I could use someone to trust.

1242
01:15:50,303 --> 01:15:52,430
Right? Don't you think that's true?

1243
01:15:52,847 --> 01:15:54,057
People can trust people

1244
01:15:54,140 --> 01:15:56,768
based on whether or not
they have something to gain?

1245
01:15:57,351 --> 01:16:00,188
Right? What do you think about that, Cal?

1246
01:16:01,773 --> 01:16:03,775
What do you think about those gains?

1247
01:16:04,817 --> 01:16:06,736
Do you think those gains can be trusted?

1248
01:16:07,820 --> 01:16:08,654
No.

1249
01:16:09,530 --> 01:16:11,574
No, I wouldn't trust those gains.

1250
01:16:13,659 --> 01:16:15,703
I'd feel a lot safer in a crowd.

1251
01:16:16,245 --> 01:16:17,080
In a crowd?

1252
01:16:17,163 --> 01:16:19,082
-More of a crowd.
-That's enough.

1253
01:16:19,165 --> 01:16:20,416
On a sandy beach.

1254
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:22,168
-[Karim] That's enough.
-Sandy.

1255
01:16:22,251 --> 01:16:23,086
It's enough.

1256
01:16:23,169 --> 01:16:24,921
-Have you talked to Alice?
-Mm-hmm.

1257
01:16:25,004 --> 01:16:27,757
Get her to show you
the picture in my apartment.

1258
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:29,592
-Time is over.
-You need Abu Rajal?

1259
01:16:29,675 --> 01:16:30,635
That's all they want.

1260
01:16:30,718 --> 01:16:32,345
Tell Alice I pray she loves me only.

1261
01:16:32,428 --> 01:16:33,554
-What?
-Stop.

1262
01:16:33,638 --> 01:16:35,473
Tell her I pray she loves me only!

1263
01:16:35,556 --> 01:16:37,141
-I pray she loves me only!
-Stop!

1264
01:16:37,225 --> 01:16:39,060
I pray she loves me only!

1265
01:16:39,143 --> 01:16:41,604
-What was that?
-You told me I could talk to him.

1266
01:16:41,687 --> 01:16:43,231
You have seven hours.

1267
01:16:44,148 --> 01:16:46,109
-How do I contact--
-No. Talking is finished.

1268
01:16:46,192 --> 01:16:49,695
You come to Fadya Crossing
at 2:30 a.m. with my brother.

1269
01:16:49,779 --> 01:16:52,031
Karim, that's not possible.

1270
01:16:52,281 --> 01:16:56,369
Okay. So I sell Riley to the Iranians.
Good luck with them.

1271
01:16:56,452 --> 01:16:58,871
Fadya Crossing, 2:30.

1272
01:16:59,789 --> 01:17:00,790
[men speaking Arabic]

1273
01:18:08,649 --> 01:18:09,942
[sighs]

1274
01:18:26,834 --> 01:18:28,169
[exhales]

1275
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:52,235
[Sandy] Stop!

1276
01:18:54,737 --> 01:18:55,780
Put the bottle down.

1277
01:18:57,615 --> 01:19:00,326
-Think the gun is really necessary?
-I wish I knew.

1278
01:19:00,409 --> 01:19:02,078
[in French] Come up, come up. He's here.

1279
01:19:02,912 --> 01:19:04,997
[Mason in English] You might want
to wait a second.

1280
01:19:05,081 --> 01:19:06,832
What the fuck are you doing here?

1281
01:19:06,916 --> 01:19:10,378
I'm here looking for something
that Cal told me was important.

1282
01:19:11,087 --> 01:19:11,963
Turn around.

1283
01:19:13,881 --> 01:19:16,550
-When was this?
-About an hour ago.

1284
01:19:17,134 --> 01:19:18,552
Tell me something I can believe.

1285
01:19:21,305 --> 01:19:23,307
-Cal told me I could trust you.
-Sorry.

1286
01:19:23,891 --> 01:19:25,851
And that Gaines was not on our side.

1287
01:19:25,935 --> 01:19:28,479
-Who are you working for?
-My friend.

1288
01:19:28,562 --> 01:19:30,231
Yeah? Cal or Karim?

1289
01:19:31,649 --> 01:19:33,234
He told me to look for a photo album,

1290
01:19:33,317 --> 01:19:34,944
that there was something important in it.

1291
01:19:39,115 --> 01:19:40,199
Where is he?

1292
01:19:41,117 --> 01:19:42,201
-He's okay.
-Where?

1293
01:19:42,285 --> 01:19:44,120
I don't know. We drove around.

1294
01:19:44,203 --> 01:19:45,997
-I was blindfolded.
-You took off the belt.

1295
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:47,957
Yes. Are you kidding?

1296
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:52,545
You think I want Ruzak dialing in
a rocket strike on my last known location?

1297
01:19:53,129 --> 01:19:54,839
There's nothing in that photo album.

1298
01:19:54,922 --> 01:19:57,633
There's nothing here, Sandy.
What is going on?

1299
01:20:01,887 --> 01:20:04,640
Don Gaines has been skimming money
from the station budget.

1300
01:20:05,057 --> 01:20:07,059
There's a bank in Cyprus
and all this shit.

1301
01:20:08,227 --> 01:20:09,937
Cal found out and wrote a grievance.

1302
01:20:10,021 --> 01:20:11,522
That's what you've been looking for.

1303
01:20:11,605 --> 01:20:13,357
Cal wrote it up, but he wanted to wait

1304
01:20:13,441 --> 01:20:16,152
through the cease-fire
before he blew the whistle.

1305
01:20:18,654 --> 01:20:20,448
And I took it out of the photo album.

1306
01:20:21,032 --> 01:20:24,327
I didn't want Alice to find it
and light the fuse.

1307
01:20:24,410 --> 01:20:28,664
Gaines is a thief and Cal knows about it.
You don't find that problematic?

1308
01:20:28,748 --> 01:20:31,375
-Don doesn't know any of this.
-Would you bet Cal's life on that?

1309
01:20:31,959 --> 01:20:34,211
Wouldn't matter. Cal's too valuable.

1310
01:20:34,295 --> 01:20:36,464
No, Sandy. Now, Cal is expendable.

1311
01:20:37,048 --> 01:20:39,842
He's a threat to Gaines
and a speed bump to Ruzak.

1312
01:20:39,925 --> 01:20:41,302
They're just gonna burn him.

1313
01:20:41,385 --> 01:20:42,803
Now they don't have to wait.

1314
01:20:42,887 --> 01:20:44,055
What do you mean?

1315
01:20:44,138 --> 01:20:47,224
Karim has given us six hours
to deliver the brother.

1316
01:20:49,727 --> 01:20:51,812
You're wrong. We've got a deadline.

1317
01:20:52,396 --> 01:20:55,191
They'll get the White House involved.
Israel has to budge.

1318
01:20:55,274 --> 01:20:57,068
Israel never had Abu Rajal.

1319
01:20:57,151 --> 01:21:01,781
They never said they did.
It cost them nothing to toy with Ruzak.

1320
01:21:02,365 --> 01:21:03,449
[Rami] Sandy?

1321
01:21:04,533 --> 01:21:05,785
[in French] Yes, I'm here.

1322
01:21:05,868 --> 01:21:08,913
[in English] Listen. Listen to me.
Listen to me. Listen to me.

1323
01:21:08,996 --> 01:21:14,585
Cal called it, okay? He kept saying,
"Pray. Love. Only.

1324
01:21:14,668 --> 01:21:17,755
Pray. Love. Only."

1325
01:21:17,838 --> 01:21:19,090
I think he's right.

1326
01:21:19,965 --> 01:21:22,134
I think the PLO have Abu Rajal.

1327
01:21:22,218 --> 01:21:23,677
[Rami in French] What are we doing?

1328
01:21:26,931 --> 01:21:28,724
Get the car.

1329
01:21:29,767 --> 01:21:31,477
[Mason in English] Come on,
think about it.

1330
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:33,854
You're the PLO. You're Arafat.

1331
01:21:33,938 --> 01:21:36,399
You're desperately trying
to hold this cease-fire together.

1332
01:21:36,482 --> 01:21:39,276
The last thing you want
is the Israelis crossing the border.

1333
01:21:39,860 --> 01:21:42,988
One more incident, one more bomb,
another assassination,

1334
01:21:43,072 --> 01:21:44,698
and they'll stop asking for permission.

1335
01:21:44,782 --> 01:21:47,076
They're gonna roll up
and push you right into the sea.

1336
01:21:47,159 --> 01:21:49,662
Rafid Abu Rajal
and his little splinter group?

1337
01:21:49,745 --> 01:21:52,373
That's a problem. He's uncontrollable.

1338
01:21:52,456 --> 01:21:53,791
What do you do if you're Arafat?

1339
01:21:53,874 --> 01:21:58,712
I think I would take him off the table.
I would put Abu Rajal on ice.

1340
01:21:58,796 --> 01:22:01,424
Because Abu Rajal wants this to fuck up.

1341
01:22:01,507 --> 01:22:03,551
He'd rather put a match
to this whole thing.

1342
01:22:04,301 --> 01:22:07,430
Ruzak wants the same thing as Abu Rajal.

1343
01:22:08,556 --> 01:22:11,767
<i>He said it. We heard him.
"Two birds, one stone." </i>

1344
01:22:13,185 --> 01:22:14,770
<i>He wants this to go sideways.</i>

1345
01:22:14,854 --> 01:22:15,813
<i>He wants to tip it over</i>

1346
01:22:15,896 --> 01:22:18,274
and give Israel all the reason it needs
to come on in here.

1347
01:22:18,357 --> 01:22:22,695
Come on. This is Cal talking.
This is him telling us what's going on.

1348
01:22:24,363 --> 01:22:28,033
<i>If you let Gaines and Ruzak
and the White House and Tel Aviv,</i>

1349
01:22:28,117 --> 01:22:31,203
<i>if you let them run their game,
Cal's gone.</i>

1350
01:22:34,748 --> 01:22:36,667
[Don] Waiting only increases the risk.

1351
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:40,171
-You understand that, right?
-We blew our chance today.

1352
01:22:41,130 --> 01:22:43,966
[Don] I need a master list
of Cal's assets and code keys.

1353
01:22:44,049 --> 01:22:46,385
We'll start prioritizing
his people quickly,

1354
01:22:46,469 --> 01:22:49,763
so we can get the relocation budgets
in place for the folks who qualify.

1355
01:22:50,264 --> 01:22:52,725
-You're hearing me, right?
-It's a death sentence.

1356
01:22:52,808 --> 01:22:56,437
Jesus, Sandy.
Nobody's quitting on Cal, okay?

1357
01:22:56,812 --> 01:22:58,564
But we get paid to be ready.

1358
01:22:58,647 --> 01:23:01,358
There's a hell of a lot
of unprotected pieces in the field.

1359
01:23:01,442 --> 01:23:03,319
You think I don't know how you feel?

1360
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,988
That could be any of us out there.

1361
01:23:09,325 --> 01:23:10,826
You're right.

1362
01:23:10,910 --> 01:23:12,369
Maybe we'll get lucky.

1363
01:23:13,787 --> 01:23:16,332
There's a secondary issue here
with Skiles.

1364
01:23:17,124 --> 01:23:19,418
We need to wrap him up
as quickly as possible.

1365
01:23:20,377 --> 01:23:22,838
It's covered.
We picked him up half an hour ago.

1366
01:23:22,922 --> 01:23:26,550
-[Don] Where?
-[Sandy] The bar at the Napoli Hotel.

1367
01:23:27,134 --> 01:23:29,428
<i>They're gonna bring him over
as soon as he's sober.</i>

1368
01:23:29,512 --> 01:23:31,138
[Don] <i>Son of a bitch.</i>

1369
01:23:31,222 --> 01:23:34,391
[Gary] <i>You know what, though?
Don't sober him up.</i>

1370
01:23:35,684 --> 01:23:36,894
<i>Keep him bombed.</i>

1371
01:23:37,478 --> 01:23:41,941
Get his signature on a security release
and pour him onto a transpo tonight.

1372
01:23:44,318 --> 01:23:45,152
Okay.

1373
01:23:45,486 --> 01:23:46,487
[Gary] Hey, Sandy?

1374
01:23:47,780 --> 01:23:49,657
You've done a hell of a job.

1375
01:23:49,740 --> 01:23:53,160
I hope you know that.
It hasn't gone unnoticed.

1376
01:23:54,119 --> 01:23:58,415
[chuckles] Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

1377
01:24:15,849 --> 01:24:17,268
[car honks]

1378
01:24:28,445 --> 01:24:29,697
You change your mind?

1379
01:24:30,406 --> 01:24:31,824
[Sandy] Little late for that.

1380
01:24:31,907 --> 01:24:32,908
[Mason] What do you mean?

1381
01:24:32,992 --> 01:24:33,951
In an hour and a half,

1382
01:24:34,034 --> 01:24:36,579
the Embassy duty officer
is gonna open the fifth floor safe

1383
01:24:37,246 --> 01:24:39,498
and discover
four million dollars is missing.

1384
01:24:42,376 --> 01:24:44,837
You're right. We're on our own.
That's Raffik.

1385
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:47,423
-[in Arabic] Put them in back.
-[in English] He's coming with us.

1386
01:24:47,506 --> 01:24:51,176
-Where is it we're going?
-I thought we'd try and make a deal.

1387
01:24:51,260 --> 01:24:53,887
And do what? Shake down the PLO?

1388
01:24:53,971 --> 01:24:57,683
Why not? I bet you're pretty handy
with four million bucks.

1389
01:24:59,768 --> 01:25:01,770
[Sandy speaking French]

1390
01:25:06,233 --> 01:25:08,152
[man speaking Arabic]

1391
01:25:28,339 --> 01:25:29,423
[Bashir in French] Sandrine?

1392
01:25:30,049 --> 01:25:31,467
Sandrine?

1393
01:25:31,550 --> 01:25:32,551
My love!

[whimpering]

1396
01:25:43,604 --> 01:25:45,022
Listen closely, Bashir.

1397
01:25:46,607 --> 01:25:48,817
You're going to tell me
what I want to know

1398
01:25:48,901 --> 01:25:51,236
or this is the last breath you'll take.

1399
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:54,073
-What the fuck nonsense is this?
-Rafid Abu Rajal!

1400
01:25:54,323 --> 01:25:55,658
Where is he?

1401
01:25:56,241 --> 01:25:57,326
Where?

1402
01:25:59,036 --> 01:26:01,372
You're not my only option, Bashir.

1403
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:07,878
[in English] Fuck you!

1404
01:26:08,337 --> 01:26:09,213

-Too much noise...
-[in English] For chrissake.

1409
01:26:21,100 --> 01:26:22,726
[in French] In the bedroom.
Go! Kill her.

1410
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:24,978
[Bashir] No. No.

1411
01:26:25,604 --> 01:26:26,605
Sandrine!

[sobbing]

1413
01:26:28,524 --> 01:26:29,900
[in Arabic] What craziness is this?

1414
01:26:29,983 --> 01:26:32,736
You let a woman tell you what to do?

1415

[in Arabic] Let's try one more time.

1418
01:26:50,713 --> 01:26:52,548
-Rafid Abu Rajal?
-[Mason shushes]

1419
01:26:52,631 --> 01:26:53,632
[Sandy] Where is he?

[Rami speaking Arabic]

1421
01:26:57,469 --> 01:26:59,471
[Mason in English]
Now that you told us where he is,

1422
01:26:59,555 --> 01:27:01,932
all you gotta do is go get him for us.

1423
01:27:03,809 --> 01:27:05,185
Call it a finder's fee.

1424
01:27:05,853 --> 01:27:08,856
$50,000 now, $50,000 on completion.

1425
01:27:08,939 --> 01:27:11,150
That's a $100,000 phone call, Bashir.

1426
01:27:11,734 --> 01:27:15,821
Plus another two million
if you can deliver Abu Rajal

1427
01:27:15,904 --> 01:27:19,450
to Al-Mazar Square alive in the next hour.

1428
01:27:25,164 --> 01:27:26,165
It's not so easy.

1429
01:27:26,248 --> 01:27:28,709
I know it's not so easy. We all know that.

1430
01:27:28,792 --> 01:27:30,711
That's why we're asking so nicely.

1431
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:33,172
And if the Old Man says no?

1432
01:27:33,255 --> 01:27:36,967
If the Old Man says no,
then all this money goes home.

[comm boss] <i>Duty officer says

[Don] All of it?
The whole four million?

1436
01:27:48,395 --> 01:27:51,440
-[comm boss] She knows Riley's code.
-Oh, my God!

1437
01:27:51,523 --> 01:27:54,777
She's got radio equipment,
vehicle, weapons.

1438
01:28:00,616 --> 01:28:01,950
[Sandy speaking French]

1439
01:28:05,996 --> 01:28:07,122
[in Arabic] Get ready.

1440
01:28:14,797 --> 01:28:17,508
[Sandy in English] Yes, I trust him.
He's one of Cal's people.

1441
01:28:18,425 --> 01:28:20,260
Cal doesn't come back, he's cooked.

1442
01:28:20,594 --> 01:28:22,221
He's fighting for his life.

1443
01:28:22,304 --> 01:28:27,142
Is that what you're doing? For Cal?
Making a hell of an effort.

1444
01:28:29,770 --> 01:28:32,481
It's not some huge romance,
if that's what you think.

1445
01:28:34,399 --> 01:28:35,526
It's not.

1446
01:28:38,278 --> 01:28:41,281
We're here, and it gets lonely.

1447
01:28:43,867 --> 01:28:45,577
Better me than someone else.

1448
01:28:45,994 --> 01:28:47,996
Hmm. Okay.

1449
01:28:48,789 --> 01:28:51,291
Come on, Bashir. He has to be here now.

1450
01:28:51,375 --> 01:28:53,502
He won't ditch us for 50 grand.

1451
01:28:53,585 --> 01:28:56,046
If he tries to rip us off,
it'll be for the whole package.

1452
01:28:56,713 --> 01:28:57,589
[laughs]

1453
01:29:01,385 --> 01:29:04,388
What's it like to throw
your whole career away in one night?

1454
01:29:05,222 --> 01:29:08,809
-You should know, right?
-You're tougher than I was.

1455
01:29:11,645 --> 01:29:15,107
I don't get surprised very often.
Not in a good way.

1456
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:18,277
That's my version of a compliment.

1457
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:20,904
All right. Thank you.

1458

[Raffik in Arabic over radio]
<i>Two cars approaching.</i>

[Raffik] <i>Southeast on Rue de Damas.</i>

[comm boss] They're coming southeast.

01:29:28,579 --> 01:29:30,247
[Sandy in Arabic over radio] <i>Okay.</i>

1463
01:29:30,330 --> 01:29:32,457

She's telling him to get ready.

1464

-She's keyed off.
-Can you triangulate the exact location?

1465
01:29:36,086 --> 01:29:38,630
[comm boss] She's smarter than that.
She's using just two walkies.

1466
01:29:38,714 --> 01:29:40,299
I may be able to track the UHS signal.

1467

-Rue de Damas, where is it?
-[Don] Along here.

1468
01:29:44,011 --> 01:29:46,597
[Mason] There you go, $2 million.

1469
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:48,432
Two million is not enough.

1470
01:29:48,515 --> 01:29:49,558
I'm in a hurry.

1471
01:29:49,641 --> 01:29:53,395
I'm already overpaying because
you know that, but I like my offer.

1472
01:29:53,478 --> 01:29:54,813
The answer to two million is no.

1473
01:29:54,896 --> 01:29:58,692
[Sandy] Mason, it's him. It's Abu Rajal.

1474
01:29:58,775 --> 01:29:59,985
May we speak privately?

[speaking Arabic]

1476
01:30:03,905 --> 01:30:07,743
[Mason] We told Bashir two million,
and you brought us Abu Rajal.

1477
01:30:07,826 --> 01:30:11,872
So let's get this settled quickly.
This is it. All I got.

1478
01:30:11,955 --> 01:30:13,707
I'm topped out. Deal speaks for itself.

1479
01:30:13,790 --> 01:30:16,752
You wouldn't open with your best offer
if your life depended on it.

1480
01:30:20,339 --> 01:30:22,007
-Two point two-five.
-Five million.

-Three.
-Four and a half is my floor.

1482
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:26,678
Point blank, I have $3.9 million exactly.

1483
01:30:26,762 --> 01:30:27,804
Going once.

1484
01:30:27,888 --> 01:30:29,890
Why should Bashir
be the only person to profit?

1485
01:30:29,973 --> 01:30:33,226
-Going twice.
-If you take the three-nine right now,

1486
01:30:33,310 --> 01:30:35,896
I swear I will tell Bashir
you settled for three-five.

1487
01:30:36,605 --> 01:30:39,232
You can go back to Arafat
with your head held high

1488
01:30:39,316 --> 01:30:41,526
and $400,000 in your pocket.

1489
01:30:46,698 --> 01:30:47,532
Deal.

We got him. Bring him.

Get the rest of the money.

This is the all the money.

01:30:56,833 --> 01:30:58,585
I had a feeling we could work this out.

1494
01:30:59,169 --> 01:31:00,629
The thing that scares me about this

1495
01:31:00,712 --> 01:31:03,507
is you haven't asked me
what I'm gonna do with him.

1496

At these prices...

1497
01:31:05,842 --> 01:31:10,972
I want you to look at my hand.
You see that? It's a laser sight.

1498

It's attached to a very high-powered rifle
that my friend Raffik has up there.

-I thought you came in good faith.
-I did.

1501
01:31:22,150 --> 01:31:24,152
Now I want to leave in one piece.

1502
01:31:24,236 --> 01:31:25,779
You don't move until after we leave,

1503
01:31:25,862 --> 01:31:27,739
maybe you'll live to spend that money.

01:34:52,110 --> 01:34:54,821
-[Sandy] <i>Mason, do you read me?</i>
-[comm boss] They keyed back in.

1548
01:34:54,905 --> 01:34:56,281
[Mason] <i>Yes, I can hear you.</i>

1549
01:34:57,741 --> 01:35:00,410
<i>It's him. It's Karim.</i>

1550
01:35:00,994 --> 01:35:02,996
-The goddamn location. Come on.
-Almost there.

1551
01:35:03,079 --> 01:35:06,416
I'll keep the walkie keyed,
so you can hear what's going on.

1552
01:35:07,417 --> 01:35:08,251
Copy.

1553
01:35:19,471 --> 01:35:24,267
Cal goes first. He makes it across safe,
then you get your brother.

1554
01:35:24,351 --> 01:35:25,268
Why should I do that?

1555
01:35:26,394 --> 01:35:28,647
Because you'll have me. I'll stay.

1556
01:35:28,730 --> 01:35:30,357
You're not worth so much.

1557
01:35:30,857 --> 01:35:32,776
Maybe you should've had
someone more important

1558
01:35:32,859 --> 01:35:34,152
make your deal for you.

1559
01:35:34,569 --> 01:35:35,737
[chuckles]

1560
01:35:39,032 --> 01:35:40,325
All right. All right.

1561
01:35:40,784 --> 01:35:43,078
We're moving forward.
Cal's gonna come over.

1562
01:35:43,161 --> 01:35:45,580
<i>-Till then, stay put.</i>
-[comm boss] I'm getting a lock on this.

1563
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:46,998
[Don] Figure out the location--

1564
01:35:47,082 --> 01:35:48,917
Just give me 30 seconds.

1565
01:35:49,501 --> 01:35:50,919
Get a team rolling now.

1566
01:35:51,002 --> 01:35:53,713
-Looks like--
-Get a fucking team rolling!

1567
01:35:53,797 --> 01:35:56,633
No, God damn it! This is Mason's deal.

1568
01:35:56,716 --> 01:35:59,678
It's his hand,
and you're gonna let him play it.

1569
01:35:59,761 --> 01:36:01,262
You step in now,

1570
01:36:01,346 --> 01:36:04,391
and I'll make sure you own this
all the way to a Senate hearing.

1571
01:36:08,979 --> 01:36:10,271
[speaking Arabic]

1572
01:36:18,446 --> 01:36:19,656
I think about Nadia.

1573
01:36:23,910 --> 01:36:26,079
Always good people suffer the most, huh?

1574
01:36:28,790 --> 01:36:30,750
Were we that wrong about you?

1575
01:36:30,834 --> 01:36:33,336
What? Was I a terrorist?

1576
01:36:35,797 --> 01:36:36,798
Not then.

1577
01:36:38,049 --> 01:36:39,300
Not that night.

1578
01:36:41,428 --> 01:36:43,013
But in the morning.

1579
01:36:48,810 --> 01:36:49,811
[in Arabic] Cut him loose.

1580
01:36:57,986 --> 01:37:01,823
<i>How you doing, buddy. You okay?
Here's the deal.</i>

1581
01:37:02,574 --> 01:37:06,077
You're gonna go over alone.
I'll stay here until it's done.

1582
01:37:08,329 --> 01:37:09,330
That's your plan?

1583
01:37:09,414 --> 01:37:11,458
It's kind of a work in progress.

1584
01:37:13,793 --> 01:37:15,170
Shit.

1585
01:37:15,295 --> 01:37:17,756
All right, go.
I'll see you on the other side.

1586
01:37:19,507 --> 01:37:20,675
[Karim in Arabic] Go!

1587
01:37:23,845 --> 01:37:26,014
[Mason] He's coming over.
Get the brother ready.

1588
01:37:26,097 --> 01:37:27,432
Copy that.

1589
01:37:27,974 --> 01:37:29,851
[Sandy and Rami speaking French]

1590
01:37:32,312 --> 01:37:33,521
[Sandy] Cal?

1591
01:37:34,189 --> 01:37:36,232
[Cal] Yeah. It's me.

1592
01:37:45,366 --> 01:37:46,367
[Sandy] Cal.

1593
01:37:56,586 --> 01:37:57,796
[speaking Arabic]

1594
01:38:01,508 --> 01:38:03,259
-[in Arabic] Little brother!
-gun cocks]

1595
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:06,721
[Karim] Rafid!

1596
01:38:10,975 --> 01:38:13,853
I knew you'd be safe.

1597
01:38:13,937 --> 01:38:15,313
[in English] Karim, are we good?

1598
01:38:15,396 --> 01:38:16,815
[Karim in Arabic] Let him go.

1599
01:38:22,570 --> 01:38:24,656
And I thank you, brother.

1600
01:38:27,075 --> 01:38:28,618
-[Karim] Rafid, no!
-[in English] Whoa!

1601
01:38:28,701 --> 01:38:31,287
-[in Arabic] Curse me, do you?
-[Rami in French] What's he doing?

1602
01:38:31,371 --> 01:38:33,498
-[in Arabic] You're free, Rafid.
-Curse me now!

1603
01:38:33,581 --> 01:38:35,416
[in English] We're done here.
It's all good.

1604
01:38:36,209 --> 01:38:37,544
Rafid, put the gun--

1605
01:38:37,627 --> 01:38:38,503
[Karim] Go, Mason. Go!

1606
01:38:41,131 --> 01:38:42,799
[speaking Arabic]

1607
01:38:46,970 --> 01:38:48,304
[Karim shouting] Rafid!

1608
01:38:49,848 --> 01:38:51,015
Rafid!

1609
01:38:55,353 --> 01:38:56,229
[Cal] Move! Move!

1610
01:39:08,408 --> 01:39:09,409
[Cal] Mason!

1611
01:39:10,368 --> 01:39:11,661
[sobbing]

1612
01:39:11,744 --> 01:39:13,121
[Cal] Mason, come on!

1613
01:39:15,915 --> 01:39:18,209
Grab my hand! Grab it!

1614
01:39:21,754 --> 01:39:22,964
All right, I got you.

1615
01:39:38,229 --> 01:39:41,024
[Roni in Arabic] Bernard! Great!

1616
01:39:41,107 --> 01:39:42,400
Get in! Get in!

1617
01:39:43,276 --> 01:39:44,777
Sandrine!

1618
01:39:44,861 --> 01:39:46,196
Get in! Good girl!

1619
01:39:50,658 --> 01:39:52,577
Okay, let's go!

1620
01:40:09,385 --> 01:40:10,762
[medic] Almost done here.

1621
01:40:15,099 --> 01:40:16,643
All right, you're all set.

1622
01:40:36,704 --> 01:40:38,081
I'll let you talk to Mason.

1623
01:40:38,998 --> 01:40:39,832
Okay.

1624
01:40:49,175 --> 01:40:50,009
You good?

1625
01:40:51,427 --> 01:40:53,763
I'll let you know
once these meds wear off.

1626
01:40:54,305 --> 01:40:55,139
How about you?

1627
01:40:55,974 --> 01:40:59,143
-I'll let you know after I get a shower.
-[chuckles]

1628
01:41:00,019 --> 01:41:01,563
Think they'll ever find Karim?

1629
01:41:02,772 --> 01:41:04,774
Well, if he doesn't find us first.

1630
01:41:06,985 --> 01:41:09,988
I still cannot believe
you pulled this through, man.

1631
01:41:10,947 --> 01:41:13,241
I mean, I feel like I won the lottery.

1632
01:41:14,909 --> 01:41:17,245
You saved my life
and I got to see you again.

1633
01:41:19,330 --> 01:41:22,709
Let's not take so long to do it next time.
Okay?

1634
01:41:24,043 --> 01:41:25,128
I would like that.

1635
01:41:27,839 --> 01:41:29,007
Thank you, Cal.

1636
01:41:32,552 --> 01:41:33,970
That's the meds talking.

1637
01:41:37,265 --> 01:41:39,934
[Frank] Are you up for a quick debrief
at the Embassy?

1638
01:41:42,270 --> 01:41:43,438
Am I gonna need a lawyer?

1639
01:41:43,521 --> 01:41:45,648
Yeah, well, it's more of a luncheon.

1640
01:41:46,274 --> 01:41:47,358
Ruzak gonna be there?

1641
01:41:47,442 --> 01:41:51,529
He's in the air back to DC.
He's got some powerful friends.

1642
01:41:51,612 --> 01:41:53,323
Who's in charge of the station?

1643
01:41:53,406 --> 01:41:56,909
Well, that job just opened up.
Don Gaines resigned this morning.

1644
01:41:56,993 --> 01:41:58,494
Not exactly sure why.

1645
01:41:58,578 --> 01:42:01,539
But we did come in on budget.

1646
01:42:01,789 --> 01:42:03,249
All I'm saying, Mason,

1647
01:42:03,333 --> 01:42:06,961
is that there is a general satisfaction
all around with the results here.

1648
01:42:07,045 --> 01:42:09,547
-Is that what you're saying?
-Things happened in haste.

1649
01:42:09,630 --> 01:42:11,924
People acted in ways

1650
01:42:12,008 --> 01:42:16,387
that might be subject
to a variety of legitimate interpretation.

1651
01:42:16,471 --> 01:42:18,056
Enough dancing, Frank.

1652
01:42:19,307 --> 01:42:22,769
Everybody got what they wanted.
It's a rare thing.

1653
01:42:22,852 --> 01:42:24,479
Might as well enjoy it.

1654
01:42:26,064 --> 01:42:28,983
-So, you riding with me?
-I got him.

1655
01:42:35,239 --> 01:42:38,868
Just forget all this ever happened, huh?
You really gonna go for that?

1656
01:42:39,619 --> 01:42:40,953
You should try it.

1657
01:42:41,537 --> 01:42:44,290
If I were you, I'd kiss this place goodbye
once and for all.

1658
01:42:44,707 --> 01:42:46,042
What if you were you?

1659
01:42:47,418 --> 01:42:49,587
I've got
a pretty good bargaining position.

1660
01:42:50,797 --> 01:42:53,508
They already offered up
some pleasant options.

1661
01:42:54,425 --> 01:42:56,052
You got somebody making that deal for you?

1662
01:42:58,846 --> 01:43:00,264
I've got a short list.

1663
01:43:01,641 --> 01:43:04,394
I'm around till dinner
if you really want to stick it to 'em.

1664
01:43:41,931 --> 01:43:44,642
The Israeli Army has moved
into southern Lebanon.

1665
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:47,895
It has a clear-cut single mission.
