and I wanted to fillet
those sons of bitches.

165
00:12:46,815 --> 00:12:48,117
But your father...

166
00:12:48,615 --> 00:12:49,848
He saw what I was thinking,

167
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:52,020
and... and he made
me think it through.

168
00:12:53,221 --> 00:12:55,289
He asked me,
"What do you want most in life?

169
00:12:55,557 --> 00:12:56,725
I said I wanted them dead.

170
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,191
And he says no.
He fought me on that.

171
00:12:59,193 --> 00:13:01,362
He said, "What you really want
is: You want your stand back."

172
00:13:01,696 --> 00:13:04,162
So I took his advice,
and I moved my stand downriver.

173
00:13:04,164 --> 00:13:05,665
I made more money
with that stand

174
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:06,668
than the first one.

175
00:13:07,534 --> 00:13:08,633
You see what I'm saying?

176
00:13:08,635 --> 00:13:10,072
If it wasn't for
your old man,

177
00:13:10,437 --> 00:13:11,807
God knows where I end up.

178
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:13,574
Maybe dead.

179
00:13:14,442 --> 00:13:15,476
Or maybe worse.

180
00:13:16,477 --> 00:13:18,310
Maybe painted as a bent cop.

181
00:13:18,312 --> 00:13:20,381
Hey, I gotta tell ya, Danny,

182
00:13:20,715 --> 00:13:22,518
I don't think Charlie
was painted bent.

183
00:13:24,249 --> 00:13:24,452
I think he was bent.

184
00:13:28,856 --> 00:13:31,360
<i>I think what Charlie loved
most in life was gambling.</i>

185
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,796
And it put him
in Driscoll's pocket.

186
00:13:34,294 --> 00:13:35,895
But fuck it.
Doesn't matter what I think.

187
00:13:35,897 --> 00:13:37,829
Cause Driscoll sat
in a courtroom,

188
00:13:37,831 --> 00:13:40,369
and he told the jury that he had
his hooks into you and Charlie,

189
00:13:41,168 --> 00:13:43,335
and you got greedy, and you
pressed him for more money.

190
00:13:43,337 --> 00:13:45,171
The next thing you know,
Charlie was dead,

191
00:13:45,173 --> 00:13:46,906
there was a dead narc
that nobody knew about,

192
00:13:46,908 --> 00:13:48,310
and you're in a fuckin' cell.

193
00:13:49,409 --> 00:13:50,675
You really
believe that, Jimmy?

194
00:13:50,677 --> 00:13:52,777
I believe what I see,
and what I hear,

195
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:56,117
and Driscoll had payments and dates in
his books from both you and Charlie.

196
00:13:56,817 --> 00:13:58,350
I never took a nickel.

197
00:13:58,352 --> 00:13:59,819
Well, Charlie did,
and he kept your end then.

198
00:13:59,821 --> 00:14:01,153
The fuck he did!

199
00:14:01,155 --> 00:14:02,688
You stuck your head
in the sand.

200
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:04,690
And if there's a crime
in that, you've done it,

201
00:14:04,692 --> 00:14:05,827
and I've done the same.

202
00:14:08,663 --> 00:14:10,396
When's Driscoll up for parole?

203
00:14:10,398 --> 00:14:11,700
[laughs] That's not the move.

204
00:14:12,267 --> 00:14:14,403
That is not the move.
The move is, go find Kate.

205
00:14:14,701 --> 00:14:16,435
You know they took
her joint away?

206
00:14:16,437 --> 00:14:19,171
They trumped up some bullshit,
took her license away,

207
00:14:19,173 --> 00:14:20,305
and closed her down.

208
00:14:20,307 --> 00:14:21,373
I didn't know that.

209
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:22,744
Of course you didn't know that!

210
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:25,346
Because you're thinking
about something else!

211
00:14:30,684 --> 00:14:31,950
Let me explain
something to you.

212
00:14:31,952 --> 00:14:33,886
Every cop in this city
hates you.

213
00:14:33,888 --> 00:14:36,258
And they're gonna come after
the thing that you love.

214
00:14:36,658 --> 00:14:38,958
What you need to do is:
You need to go find her.

215
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,194
She's working as a waitress.

216
00:14:41,196 --> 00:14:44,266
As a fucking waitress
in some joint out in the sticks.

217
00:14:44,865 --> 00:14:45,900
Go find her.

218
00:14:46,366 --> 00:14:48,202
And make a life for yourselves.

219
00:14:48,469 --> 00:14:50,439
Because she's the best thing
that ever happened to you.

220
00:14:53,474 --> 00:14:54,873
Jimmy, I killed
Driscoll's brother.

221
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,745
He's not the kind
of guy to forget that.

222
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:06,719
What do you need from me?

223
00:15:06,721 --> 00:15:07,755
When's he out?

224
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,425
- Sixth of April.
- Sixth of April?

225
00:15:10,825 --> 00:15:12,525
- He gonna make it?
- Of course he's gonna.

226
00:15:12,527 --> 00:15:14,259
He turned in two dirty cops.

227
00:15:14,261 --> 00:15:15,695
The judge thanked him for it.

228
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:17,765
Sixth of April, he's out,
just like you are.

229
00:15:18,932 --> 00:15:20,565
Now listen to me.

230
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:22,401
I know you're not bent
like Driscoll said you are,

231
00:15:22,403 --> 00:15:24,237
but if you go out
and kill this guy,

232
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:25,607
that's exactly
what you're gonna be.

233
00:15:27,942 --> 00:15:29,878
Charlie was good,
he fooled us both.

234
00:15:30,711 --> 00:15:32,411
But, fuck, it's time to move on.

235

That's the call here.

236
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:35,951
Let it go.

237
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,584
Jimmy, if I don't
believe in Charlie,

238
00:15:38,586 --> 00:15:39,922
I don't believe
in anything.

239
00:15:42,923 --> 00:15:44,192
Welcome home, Danny.

240
00:15:47,427 --> 00:15:48,797
Sorry about the stink.

so he helped me out

She was having a problem
with her husband.

hiding money.

you steal from somebody.

She thought that she could find
out who he was stealing it from,

313
00:20:59,574 --> 00:21:02,106
she could use it against him,
try to save their marriage.

But that's what
she wanted so...

about my sister, all right?

Charlie that night.

325
00:21:29,737 --> 00:21:31,540
It was Pierce's car, man.
It blew up.

326
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:33,575
Not Jen's.

327
00:21:34,141 --> 00:21:36,545
Jennifer, that was her name.

328
00:21:37,077 --> 00:21:38,276
What'd the cops say?

329
00:21:38,278 --> 00:21:40,379
They bullshitted around,

330
00:21:40,381 --> 00:21:42,815
made a lot of promises, like they were
gonna get who did it, then nothin'.

331
00:21:42,817 --> 00:21:45,351
- You told them about Pierce?
- About a thousand times.

332
00:21:45,353 --> 00:21:46,951
They thought since
it was Pierce's car,

333
00:21:46,953 --> 00:21:48,621
he might've been
the intended target.

334
00:21:48,623 --> 00:21:49,988
It's fuckin' horseshit.

335
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,992
It's an ongoing investigation.

336

[music swells]

337
00:21:54,929 --> 00:21:57,566
Just wanna make sure
you have my pay ready tomorrow.

338
00:21:57,865 --> 00:21:58,799
Yeah.

339
00:22:00,201 --> 00:22:01,169
Hi.

340
00:22:01,868 --> 00:22:02,836
Hi.

341
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,251
You ever work with
Lenny Driscoll?

342
00:22:17,852 --> 00:22:18,887
Lenny Driscoll?

343
00:22:19,854 --> 00:22:20,889
You know I'm a bookie.

344
00:22:21,188 --> 00:22:22,654
Of course
I worked with him.

345
00:22:22,656 --> 00:22:24,323
What about your sister
or Pierce?

346
00:22:24,325 --> 00:22:25,824
Do they know
Lenny Driscoll?

347
00:22:25,826 --> 00:22:27,191
Not that I'm aware of.

348
00:22:27,193 --> 00:22:28,893
You think Pierce had
something to do with

349
00:22:28,895 --> 00:22:30,264
what happened to you
that night?

350
00:22:31,798 --> 00:22:32,866
Him or you.

351
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:38,807
Listen, man,
I don't know you well.

352
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,875
But I knew Charlie.
We were friends.

353
00:22:42,242 --> 00:22:44,612
All right? I don't beat
people up unless I have to.

354
00:22:44,845 --> 00:22:46,014
And I don't kill people.

355
00:22:47,013 --> 00:22:48,713
Not friends like Charlie

356
00:22:48,715 --> 00:22:50,951
and not scumbags
like my sister's husband.

357
00:22:53,354 --> 00:22:54,990
What did you sister do?

358
00:22:55,221 --> 00:22:57,389
For work? Nothing.

359
00:22:57,391 --> 00:22:59,324
She painted in college.

360
00:22:59,326 --> 00:23:02,227
She actually started taking art
classes again over at the academy

361
00:23:02,229 --> 00:23:03,731
when she found out
about Pierce.

362
00:23:04,265 --> 00:23:06,230
- What about Pierce?
- He's an accountant.

363
00:23:06,232 --> 00:23:07,268
For the government.

364
00:23:08,068 --> 00:23:09,401
He never said much about it.

365
00:23:09,403 --> 00:23:11,373
Treasury Department, I think.

366
00:23:17,978 --> 00:23:19,080
That's Jen.

367
00:23:20,146 --> 00:23:22,113
You know, my sister,
she wasn't an important person,

368
00:23:22,115 --> 00:23:23,283
but she was a good person.

369
00:23:23,483 --> 00:23:25,285
And she deserved more
than what she got.

370
00:23:25,752 --> 00:23:27,419
So if you find anything out,

371
00:23:27,421 --> 00:23:29,658
I'd appreciate it
if you let me know about it.

talking to Bill Pierce
over there.

Where will you
go from here?

depart from evil,

She was never enrolled.

489
00:33:16,542 --> 00:33:18,343
There's something that I
considered showing the police,

490

but they never
came by to ask.

491
00:33:20,346 --> 00:33:21,680
I don't even know
if it's important,

492
00:33:21,682 --> 00:33:23,416
but for some reason
I kept it.

Hello, Marcy.

Actually, it's Rebecca.

522
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:07,181
- Gallagher.
- I know.

523
00:36:07,947 --> 00:36:09,680
I know everything about you.

00:36:09,682 --> 00:36:11,115
What do you know about me?

525
00:36:11,117 --> 00:36:13,517
Well, I know you work for
some government agency:

526
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:16,090
CIA, FSB, FU2, one of them.

527
00:36:16,922 --> 00:36:18,755
I know you had
the police investigation

528
00:36:18,757 --> 00:36:20,492
into the death
of Jennifer Pierce shut down.

529
00:36:20,494 --> 00:36:22,159
I know you were
sleeping with Jennifer,

530
00:36:22,161 --> 00:36:24,564
but I bet there was no love lost
there when she was murdered.

531
00:36:26,032 --> 00:36:27,101
Anything else?

532
00:36:28,501 --> 00:36:29,869
I liked you better
as a blonde.

533
00:36:30,903 --> 00:36:31,938
Give it time.

534
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:34,074
I don't think so.

535
00:36:34,574 --> 00:36:36,273
Why are you tracking
Bill Pierce?

536
00:36:36,275 --> 00:36:37,644
That's my business.

537
00:36:39,512 --> 00:36:40,713
This is who I work for.

538
00:36:41,847 --> 00:36:43,050
That should scare you.

539
00:36:43,983 --> 00:36:45,682
It scares the hell
out of me.

540
00:36:45,684 --> 00:36:46,987
What's it got to do
with Pierce?

541
00:36:47,253 --> 00:36:49,586
You're interfering with
a major investigation

542
00:36:49,588 --> 00:36:51,090
having to do with
national security.

543
00:36:51,525 --> 00:36:53,124
You need to back off.

544
00:36:53,126 --> 00:36:54,995
If you don't back off,
I will force you to back off.

545
00:36:55,996 --> 00:36:57,498
You understand that, right?

546
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:59,699
Seems pretty clear enough.

My cell is on the card
if you have any questions.

548
00:37:04,603 --> 00:37:05,806
I do have a question.

549
00:37:07,007 --> 00:37:10,041
How much money do you think a
guy like Pierce makes a year?

550
00:37:10,043 --> 00:37:11,943
- Why?
- He's got a young mistress.

551
00:37:11,945 --> 00:37:14,679
He buys her gifts, expensive
jewelry, got a nice place

552
00:37:14,681 --> 00:37:16,750
down on the waterfront
with her shacked up.

553
00:37:17,117 --> 00:37:19,553
Be nice to know where he's
getting all that money from.

554
00:37:20,186 --> 00:37:23,923
You sticking your nose into this is
only going to make things worse.

555
00:37:24,157 --> 00:37:26,861
Well it couldn't get much worse
for Jennifer Pierce, could it?

556
00:37:27,693 --> 00:37:29,226
By the way,
you sleeping with her,

557
00:37:29,228 --> 00:37:31,061
was that for God
and country and all that

558
00:37:31,063 --> 00:37:32,199
or was that for real?

- Eddie!
- Ugh.

off again?

that somehow gets you
a free pass.

00:42:37,135 --> 00:42:38,838
I'll say that cause
you a scumbag.

650
00:42:39,472 --> 00:42:41,141
Ask me why you a scumbag.

651
00:42:41,541 --> 00:42:43,410
Why am I a scumbag?

652
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:47,181
Because I've been on the job 18
years, 9 months, and 22 days,

653
00:42:47,512 --> 00:42:49,248
and I don't have
a gold shield.

654
00:42:49,581 --> 00:42:51,585
Ask me why I don't have
a gold shield.

655
00:42:52,385 --> 00:42:54,284
Why don't you have
a gold shield?

656
00:42:54,286 --> 00:42:56,253
'Cause the day you
and your partner got caught,

657
00:42:56,255 --> 00:42:58,255
the bosses stopped all
promotions until

658
00:42:58,257 --> 00:43:01,194
they completed an investigation
into police corruption.

659
00:43:01,927 --> 00:43:03,496
I still don't have
my gold shield.

660
00:43:04,097 --> 00:43:06,900
And that, my friend,
is why you are a scumbag.

661

662
00:43:09,168 --> 00:43:10,304

What you wanted
on the car bombing.

00:46:20,358 --> 00:46:23,063
It's an ongoing
investigation so, uh...

720
00:46:23,695 --> 00:46:25,463
The material's highly
sensitive which means

721
00:46:25,465 --> 00:46:27,363
don't ask any questions
which also means

722
00:46:27,365 --> 00:46:29,235
get the fuck
out of my face.

723
00:46:29,802 --> 00:46:32,202
The materials on the
forensics that was, uh...

00:46:32,204 --> 00:46:33,470
That was more difficult.

Luckily I had a buddy
in forensics.

00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:49,153
Charlie was working something
on a guy named "Pierce."

731
00:46:49,155 --> 00:46:51,191
Husband of the woman
who got blown up.

732
00:46:51,456 --> 00:46:53,389
I think that's why
Driscoll killed him.

733
00:46:53,391 --> 00:46:54,693
Charlie found out
what they were into.

734
00:46:56,596 --> 00:46:58,331
Whatever you're chasing
is a dead end.

735
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,900
You have any idea
what kind of money

736
00:47:03,902 --> 00:47:06,305
Charlie was into the Shylocks
in this town for?

737
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:08,608
Forty-two five.

738
00:47:09,474 --> 00:47:11,876
Forty-two five to three
different Shys in this town,

739
00:47:11,878 --> 00:47:13,747
and that's the kinda money
that gets you bent.

- Still on.

You go after Driscoll,
I can't help you, Danny.

You understand that?

I don't want your help.

I don't give a fuck if you want
it or not, I still can't do it.

746
00:47:28,327 --> 00:47:30,226
But I can go back
to my original advice

747
00:47:30,228 --> 00:47:31,564
which is go find Kate,

748
00:47:31,898 --> 00:47:33,764
go to, uh, Paraguay

749
00:47:33,766 --> 00:47:36,536
or some godforsaken
country nobody can pronounce,

750

her off at the airport.

She went home, you know?

Yeah.

766
00:48:36,362 --> 00:48:37,661
So?

767
00:48:37,663 --> 00:48:39,597
Well Pierce doesn't work
for the Treasury.

768
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,731
I don't know what the hell he
does, but he ain't no accountant.

What?

772
00:48:46,938 --> 00:48:48,505
The bomb blew up
Pierce's car.

773
00:48:48,507 --> 00:48:50,340
Why wasn't your sister
driving her own?

00:48:50,342 --> 00:48:51,510
It was in the shop.

- No. I don't know.

Do you have any idea

777
00:48:56,248 --> 00:48:58,651
why Pierce goes to a church
all the way over in Seidel?

778
00:48:59,952 --> 00:49:02,189
Bill Pierce? He never went
to church in his life.

779
00:49:03,255 --> 00:49:04,423
He's an atheist.

He was amazing!

Oh, Father Bailey's
the best.

He's a monsignor.

- Is he around?
- Nope. He's traveling again.

If it wasn't for
Father Bailey,

803
00:50:04,583 --> 00:50:05,816

would have nowhere to pray,

Oh, he's turnin'
it around.

- Where is he traveling?
- Middle East.

World Food Program.

[Rebecca] <i>Hello?</i>

824
00:51:39,177 --> 00:51:40,946
People keep trying to kill me.
It's getting annoying.

825
00:51:41,146 --> 00:51:42,514
Now my car is gone.

826
00:51:42,715 --> 00:51:44,748
It was ten years old,
had a busted taillight.

827
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:47,454
It was a piece of shit,
but it was mine, I liked it.

828
00:51:47,853 --> 00:51:48,855
<i>I can't help you.</i>

829
00:51:49,454 --> 00:51:50,686
Actually, you can.

830
00:51:50,688 --> 00:51:52,054
Ask me why.

831
00:51:52,056 --> 00:51:53,690
I learned this trick
from a piece-of-shit cop.

832
00:51:53,692 --> 00:51:54,994
Go ahead; ask me why.

833
00:51:55,795 --> 00:51:57,795
<i>Why?</i>

834
00:51:57,797 --> 00:51:59,862
Because I followed Bill Pierce to a
church so far outside his parish

835
00:51:59,864 --> 00:52:01,533
it might as well
have been in China.

836
00:52:01,833 --> 00:52:04,034
He's delivering envelopes
to a priest who travels

837
00:52:04,036 --> 00:52:06,039
to the Middle East
every couple of weeks.

What does Pierce do for the
Department of Fiscal Oversight,

848
00:53:24,215 --> 00:53:26,552
which by the way
doesn't actually exist.

849
00:53:26,885 --> 00:53:28,086
He's an analyst.

850
00:53:29,188 --> 00:53:31,255
He's decoding transmissions
between certain countries

851
00:53:31,257 --> 00:53:33,025
that might pose
a threat to us.

852
00:53:33,858 --> 00:53:36,695
He's selling those
transmissions to the Iranians.

853
00:53:36,996 --> 00:53:39,032
The monsignor is
passing them along.

854
00:53:39,697 --> 00:53:41,099
But we're not after Pierce.

855
00:53:42,134 --> 00:53:44,166
We're after who he's
working with,

00:53:44,168 --> 00:53:45,637
someone higher up.

857
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:47,574
Who killed
Jennifer Pierce?

858
00:53:48,541 --> 00:53:49,576
The Iranians.

859
00:53:50,742 --> 00:53:51,777
How do you know that?

860
00:53:52,545 --> 00:53:54,681
The bomb was made in Iran...

861
00:53:55,114 --> 00:53:57,650
with materials from
the Ukraine and Russia.

862
00:53:57,949 --> 00:54:00,085
If Pierce was working with
them, why would they kill him?

863
00:54:00,318 --> 00:54:03,590
A very important Iranian
agent was recently lost.

864
00:54:04,188 --> 00:54:05,190
"Lost?"

865
00:54:07,159 --> 00:54:08,528
Eliminated.

866
00:54:09,193 --> 00:54:10,829
The bombing was payback.

867
00:54:11,297 --> 00:54:15,235
Pierce's wife had the
misfortune of driving his car

868
00:54:15,733 --> 00:54:17,103
the morning she was killed.

869
00:54:18,003 --> 00:54:19,735
Her name was Jennifer.

870
00:54:19,737 --> 00:54:20,938
You slept with her.

871
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:21,840
Why can't you
say her name?

872
00:54:22,641 --> 00:54:23,742
It was her idea.

873
00:54:24,342 --> 00:54:25,944
Who tried to
kill me today?

874

You?

876
00:54:29,248 --> 00:54:30,148
No.

877
00:54:31,215 --> 00:54:32,719
I have been reassigned.

878
00:54:36,255 --> 00:54:37,690
Because I wouldn't do it.

Lose me?

880
00:54:40,858 --> 00:54:42,358
- Yes.
- Why?

881
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,029
Because I think
it's wrong.

882
00:54:44,762 --> 00:54:45,864
To lose you.

883
00:54:46,831 --> 00:54:48,233
Why'd you agree
to meet today?

884
00:54:49,635 --> 00:54:52,171
To convince you
to back off.

885
00:54:54,873 --> 00:54:56,940
Was it the agency in my
loft the other night?

886
00:54:56,942 --> 00:54:58,275
I told you.

887

You're a dead man.

Yes.

Monsignor Bailey, a beloved

was the only person
to die in the fire.

Tom Loach.

you do that for?

01:02:24,322 --> 01:02:25,490
And I'd like
to stay out.

976
01:02:26,324 --> 01:02:27,624
I'm giving myself
a chance here.

977
01:02:27,626 --> 01:02:28,691
I gave you a chance.

[woman] Dougie!

979
01:02:31,362 --> 01:02:32,364
Everything all right?

980
01:02:32,731 --> 01:02:33,662
Yeah!

981
01:02:33,664 --> 01:02:35,166
G's an old friend.

982
01:02:39,637 --> 01:02:40,538
G.

983
01:02:41,373 --> 01:02:42,708
What I got here
ain't much.

984
01:02:43,275 --> 01:02:45,277
But that kid?
He's mine.

985
01:02:46,411 --> 01:02:47,644
I get it, Dougie.

986
01:02:47,646 --> 01:02:48,581
I really do.

987
01:02:48,813 --> 01:02:50,648
This is a one-time deal,
okay?

988
01:02:57,688 --> 01:03:01,724
The battery, the wires,
the timer, even the C-4,

989
01:03:01,726 --> 01:03:03,329
you get that
stuff anywhere.

990
01:03:03,628 --> 01:03:04,760
You wanna know what?

Whether it's foreign
or domestic.

997
01:03:15,139 --> 01:03:16,174
Will he talk to me?

998
01:03:17,141 --> 01:03:18,309
Probably not. He's gonna
think you're a cop.

999
01:03:19,210 --> 01:03:20,478
Tell him you're my friend,

1000
01:03:21,346 --> 01:03:23,048
- and, "I
- emember Bernadette."

"Bernadette?"

1002

No cop will know
anything about that.

don't blame me.

They're called taggants.

Same principle for tracing

I don't have time.

Hm.

1027
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:44,287
You can try tracing
the pipe

back to the plumbing
supply source.

1029

Same as the timer and the wire,
but that takes time too.

Ah, wait a minute.

The blasting caps.

1037
01:06:14,585 --> 01:06:15,620
What about them?

1038
01:06:16,621 --> 01:06:18,590
They're color-coated to
the manufacturer, right?

1039
01:06:18,822 --> 01:06:20,623
And these colors here,
what we're looking at,

come from one place
and one place only.

No. Atglen about
100 miles away.

What?

Is there any way this bomb

No.

Can I ask you
another question?

1053
01:06:52,456 --> 01:06:53,491
Why not?

1054

all about it.

I want to hear it
from you.

1072
01:08:19,610 --> 01:08:21,510
My partner and I were
trying to take down

1073
01:08:21,512 --> 01:08:23,515
a drug dealer
named Driscoll.

1074

It went sour.

undercover narc from

another operation on the boat
that we didn't know about.

1077
01:08:32,122 --> 01:08:33,424
Charlie killed him.

1078
01:08:33,957 --> 01:08:35,126
Driscoll got caught.

1079
01:08:35,726 --> 01:08:36,894
Painted us as bent.

1080

No.

But I'm not so
sure about Charlie.

1083
01:08:46,671 --> 01:08:48,039
What they did to you,

1084
01:08:48,605 --> 01:08:50,809
they did to my last partner
in the field.

1085
01:08:54,145 --> 01:08:56,515
A good man
who gave them everything.

He hung himself before they
could beat him to the punch.

It wasn't foreign made.

I needed you
to walk away.

1090

You knew Pierce
killed his wife.

1091
01:09:24,175 --> 01:09:25,911
It wasn't important to us.

1092
01:09:26,610 --> 01:09:28,079
So you buried the report.

01:09:56,875 --> 01:09:57,943
Why'd he kill her?

She was taping his
phone conversations.

he was doing, it was wrong.

"Something terrible,"
is what she said.

Where's his money?

I mean he's obviously
got a stash somewhere.

1106
01:10:13,024 --> 01:10:15,258
I doubt he'd trust the
bank, too easy to trace.

1107
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:16,695
He didn't. I checked.

Okay, so, if I'm him,

I'm hiding, just waiting
for the right time,

he'd know what I look like.

He's investigating you

1156
01:14:26,144 --> 01:14:27,409
He found out about
the monsignor.

1157
01:14:27,411 --> 01:14:28,947
That's why you
killed him, right?

1158
01:14:29,814 --> 01:14:31,316
- Right?
- Yes! Yes!

1159

She made me do it.
She's crazy!

1160
01:14:33,784 --> 01:14:35,851
The plan is to kill me
then take the car?

1161
01:14:35,853 --> 01:14:37,318
- Right!
- And then the car blows up.

- Yes! The car blows up!

It's only about the money.

It's always about
the money, isn't it?

He doesn't count.

Drop it.

1184
01:15:46,957 --> 01:15:49,224
- I don't want to die.
- I don't wanna die either.

1185
01:15:49,226 --> 01:15:51,162
But if I'm gonna die,
I'm gonna die last.

Neither one of us

Nobody cares.

I tried giving them
everything I had.

And they spit it
right back in my face.

Walk over to the trunk
and get the money.

If we don't get
blown to hell,

1204
01:16:49,153 --> 01:16:50,956
then we can go
before they get here.

But instead he tried
to turn Charlie.

He bought the 42.5
