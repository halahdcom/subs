1
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,370
When you see this

2
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:16,537
You have the illusion of light

3
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:51,434
BEYOND REALITY

4
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,289
Friday, at 10 pm

5
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,386
People will spend the night in the casino

6
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:11,362
And that means, I'll be very sleepy tonight.

7
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:16,334
It's been three months working in this casino.

8
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,294
Everything is serious here

9
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:20,269
CCTV is everywhere

10
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:22,307
The security guards, the navy alumni

11
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,342
And I know everybody

12
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,411
Hi, Richie! How is your wife?

13
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:28,405
And everyone knows me

14
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:31,307
In a way, we're a big happy family

15
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,383
Richie is in charge of Blackjack

16
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,350
His back is not healthy

17
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,421
So I have to help set up a scrambler.

18
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:38,346
Diana

19
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,254
responsible betting table

20
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,428
He is my main problem

21
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,456
Because everyone knows I'm in love with her.

22
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:47,490
But you know what my mom told me?

23
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,469
If a woman ignores you

24
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:53,427
He might like you

25
00:02:56,476 --> 00:03:00,344
I would deem silence - 'may'

26
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:04,283
But it seems he is not ready for a serious relationship.

27
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:12,288
Tn. Gold. The most demanding customers.

28
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,290
But I've learned all the complications.

29
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,387
And I am the one who is always told to serve him

30
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,461
Sometimes I hear something I should not hear.

31
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:27,372
But I do not interfere, and I will keep it a secret

32
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:32,276
So, in general. Everything is fine

33
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,505
But there is one thing

34
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:39,376
In the real world, my name is Michael

35
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,412
And I'm a con-artist

36
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,450
Rich's lower back made him feel pain

37
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:49,489
But it helps me. If not, I will not be able to approach the scrambler.

38
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,391
Con is also a game

39
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,435
I have prepared this moment for 3 months

40
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:16,354
The first step, Fireworks

41
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:45,317
Can I join?

42
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,253
The second step, Miracle Craps

43
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:58,328
According to Diana, I came to Crap's shirt to tease her

44
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,391
But I love money more

45
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:03,334
Much more loving money

46
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:20,377
Congratulations, sir

47
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,289
It's my lucky day, right?

48
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,462
The third step, VIP Card

49
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,497
I've been investigating

50
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:44,309
I have so many ideas that I want to do to him

51
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:47,370
But, I'm not a greedy person

52
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:49,473
After the mess I made

53
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,342
Card games will be accepted throughout the casino

54
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,216
We are having a technical annoyance. Please go to IT room.

55
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:59,291
While the explorers find out what happened

56
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:02,485
The richest customers are invited to the VIP room

57
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,295
That's what I need

58
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:12,233
Maybe this trick is very old

59
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:15,269
And the guards are now looking for who the Con Artist is

60
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:21,246
They will succeed. But this is part of my plan.

61
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,448
Fourth step, Elevator

62
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:48,373
- Where is the VIP hall? It's an elevator for the waiter, sir

63
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:49,441
Is it true?

64
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:53,437
How can I know which elevator is for the maid, and who is not for the maid

65
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:58,215
It's just a misunderstanding, do not worry, sir. I'll take you upstairs

66
00:06:58,384 --> 00:06:59,408
Yes, it should be so

67
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:16,263
Okay, what happened?

68
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:20,270
- Sir, please be patient for a moment. Do not tell me to be patient, I will

69
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,266
God, this can not be trusted

70
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,345
- Gosh .... Be cool, sir

71
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,446
- You see? Everything is alright. - Fuck!

72
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:33,410
- The VIP hall is on ... Yeah, I know, you're stupid

73
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,422
The real chaos begins

74
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:41,384
Right after everyone thought it was over.

75
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,353
Please, the card

76
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:59,411
Bingo, all I need is the same desk

77
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,371
This is a place for high level affairs

78
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:07,443
The chips are very valuable

79
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:12,280
Thanks to Diana, I have enough capital to bet on

80
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,229
As long as I work here, I learn my opponents well

81
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,301
Nobody knows me, but they are like family to me.

82
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,401
Step Five, Modern Technology

83
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:43,448
God, this is amazing..I flew 3000 miles

84
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,349
just to get trapped inside the elevator

85
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:50,319
God, this can not be trusted

86
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:52,396
- Sir, please calm down ... No, you just calm down

87
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,414
The main thing is not to win every time

88
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:11,338
You have to be sure

89
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:12,473
You got a good chance

90
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,254
Then, add your bet

91
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:36,304
I see this is a serious game

92
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,234
Though I think this is a place to have fun.

93
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,241
Maybe we can consider

94
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,456
All in

95
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,293
All in

96
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,467
I heard Dr. Ed has lost his license again

97
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,403
From my father, then my brothers, and now you!

98
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,449
Maybe you also want to give me advice?

99
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,420
If I can give you advice

100
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:58,482
When in doubt, do not do it!

101
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:01,281
Based on my experience

102
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:05,292
Especially if it's the last one you've got.

103
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:08,329
If I need your advice I will ask you.

104
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,435
Welcome

105
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:28,510
You should hear the advice of the wise.

106
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:45,360
What are you doing? - This father won.

107
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:53,311
Do not think too much, it's just money

108
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:57,380
Bring up. Thank you, ba pa k-ba pak

109
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:26,437
Why are you doing this to me? Where's my money?

110
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,304
Take this, just take it all

111
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,514
Where's my money? - I do not know.

112
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:46,264
No, not me. He!

113
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,491
No, no!

114
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,370
I'm the owner of this casino

115
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,342
My name is Victor

116
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,341
Where is the money?

117
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,248
I do not know

118
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:04,314
Have you tried looking in the bank?

119
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:09,377
Look, I'm one of your VIP clients

120
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:12,321
I'm on my way to victory

121
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:14,415
and then there was the con artist who thwarted my victory

122
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:18,258
What kind of operation do you run here?

123
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,365
God, your hand is so hard

124
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:23,423
Hear

125
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,462
A Con-man, take everything

126
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,406
He's what you should be looking for, not me

127
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:35,438
You make me rugilebih more than 5 million Euros.

128
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:42,351
I have to compensate the players, for their defeat.

129
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:46,481
You have to return all the money to me.

130
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,522
You have 1 week

131
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:53,488
APa7

132
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:55,333
One week?

133
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:58,463
It took 3 months to play this all

134
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:00,363
okay, okay, I got it

135
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:03,441
Okay

136
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:09,246
I have to say this, if I try to hide,

137
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,337
we will find you

138
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:14,409
You're an intelligent person, you know what I mean.

139
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,457
7 Day Countdown begins

140
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,398
Hello

141
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,508
A very good welcome

142
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:19,315
Mayki?

143
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:21,282
Mayki

144
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,421
- How are you? Nice to meet you again

145
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,225
What are you doing? You do not know him?

146
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:30,352
He is the best collector in history

147
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:34,323
They do not make people like this anymore.

148
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:41,364
Mayki, I think we will never meet again.

149
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,433
You should be on an island somewhere.

150
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:51,474
LEO!!

151
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,513
What does this symbol mean?

152
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:00,382
Wait here

153
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:12,269
Now, tell me! What's really going on?

154
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:18,433
I do not know, replaced the card in my hand

155
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:23,345
He changed your visual perception

156
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,288
Okay, psychic says

157
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,458
fortune teller, or magic practitioner

158
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:41,357
who are born with a talent for entering the subconscious,

159
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:46,295
It was like a room

160
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:50,332
Where you are allowed to perform any supernatural activity.

161
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:55,346
So, the con-man, has the ability

162
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,506
To change what everyone sees,

163
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:04,320
Leon, why do not you just tell me, where can I find him?

164
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,514
This is not a fairy tale

165
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:07,449
More precisely is the legend

166
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,261
We are all encompassed by the subconscious

167
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:15,433
And all the things that can not be explained,

168
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:19,395
And people with this ability can come out of the conscious realm,

169
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,403
leading to the collective unconscious

170
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,338
It's like an infinite universe

171
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:26,501
That will open unlimited possibilities.

172
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:30,315
And access to all unlimited human knowledge.

173
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:33,477
Normal people can also enter the subconscious

174
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,514
But they did not get out there without a special talisman.

175
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:40,381
A special kind of compass

176
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:49,523
Come on, Leon

177
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,495
Seriously

178
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,271
Is my 5 million money also there?

179
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:59,375
Here there is all information about the activities of Normal, and those with i1 capabilities

180
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,514
Just read it, dikantoranu

181
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,508
Now, I have a business

182
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:29,396
Alex, does everything go well?

183
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,431
As usual

184
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:34,334
It's your 5 million

185
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:39,512
Did he give you trouble? - He's as talented as me,

186
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,313
By the way, what is he doing?

187
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,291
I think he's trying to get rid of the problem now.

188
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:51,354
Who says - I'm pretty sure.

189
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:56,462
No problems in Las Vegasyang can not be solved.

190
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:11,239
This suitcase, skin quality is better

191
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:26,322
I have not seen a thing like that for a long time.

192
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:28,493
I circled half of this world to get it

193
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,296
Do you think you're the only one who can use this?

194
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:39,400
All right, do you agree to teach me?

195
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,505
You do not need to be too stiff

196
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,385
I offer this world to you

197
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:50,250
To save me

198
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,319
Shows the world you know

199
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,318
We work a lot together

200
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:59,287
And if you do not come back, who will I work for?

201
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:03,459
I'll be safe with this, right?

202
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:05,392
No

203
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:07,329
It's not safe enough

204
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,506
You need a partner

205
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:10,308
And I can not be me

206
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:13,307
Someone you can rely on someone you can trust.

207
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,242
Someone who really loves you

208
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:19,450
Do you have someone like that? - I will work on it.

209
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,444
Are you sure you want to do this?

210
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:29,385
When I was a kid

211
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:32,229
I have a two volume book

212
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:33,455
IHD Walls

213
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:40,304
The other one I always remember all my life

214
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,271
The story of a boy

215
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:45,334
a lonely dreamer

216
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:52,315
One day, he met someone

217
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:55,317
which entered from the right door

218
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:59,285
And then he realized that he was in magic.

219
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:00,480
In the world he lives in

220
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:04,295
He was amazed by what he saw

221
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:07,226
He loves to be there

222
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:08,490
How did he get back?

223
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:17,300
She looked up and found herself back

224
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,468
He's very lucky

225
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:22,313
Maybe

226
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,444
But when compared with your ability,

227
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,218
I feel he's nothing

228
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:34,316
That magic door

229
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,428
He wants to be a great kid

230
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,497
and I do not want to do the same thing

231
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,391
You understand?

232
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,492
Especially because now we have this

233
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:48,296
It's nothing

234
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,509
It will help you show direction in the unconscious world. But without a partner ....

235
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,438
You can never come back

236
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,379
It will be more challenging

237
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:02,277
6 DAYS

238
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:18,298
What are you doing?

239
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:20,393
I did it for you

240
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:24,333
You'll never know if someone is spying on you

241
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:32,406
Have you found your conman?

242
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:38,287
No, no, just

243
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:40,450
Just a few people I do not know

244
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:44,523
Are you sure this is real?

245
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,424
You're insulting me now!

246
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,435
All the goods here are lively

247
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:55,397
I saw everything with my own eyes.

248
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:59,334
And some of them. Some of these beautiful freaks

249
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,444
I see them myself

250
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,269
Directly

251
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:07,275
Luckily you said that to me. I saw them in your casino.

252
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:20,263
- What? Bella!

253
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:22,425
I'm stupid

254
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,472
Hey, what are you doing with my X-Files?

255
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:31,502
Okay, this is what I think

256
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:34,437
Being a host is an opportunity

257
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,272
but sometimes it takes time that I do not have.

258
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,314
I only have one week

259
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,451
But what if I can change the time to plan

260
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,415
With the capabilities it has

261
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:50,226
For example, can not this guy move things?

262
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:54,432
He can certainly make the dice move

263
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,291
I have no idea

264
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:02,337
Roulette Ball

265
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:06,267
Eric, rich kid

266
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:08,507
Son of a famous businessman

267
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:11,439
Father wants to promote his family's business

268
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:14,349
But Eric is a spoiled child

269
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:16,283
He does not want to work

270
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:18,456
He wants to have fun for the rest of his life.

271
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:21,415
You will not be able to bribe him with money

272
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:38,500
Why did not you go on with the party?

273
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:42,380
Who are you?

274
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:48,480
Let's just say I'm your good dewy mother,

275
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:50,447
who saved you from the glass tower

276
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:53,314
and who opened the world of adventure

277
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:56,360
Your talents will be needed

278
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:01,232
My mother was like a hormonal problem

279
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:04,235
If you want to listen to my dongs

280
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:07,471
Rather than having to hear the funny joke from your father

281
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,445
Okay, this guy, his name is Tony

282
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:17,304
He can control electronic devices.

283
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:20,511
So, he will not get caught on camera?

284
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:27,486
He's a bit coward

285
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,327
He was just brave with the little things

286
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:33,328
Make glass move faster

287
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:35,392
In order to break through the red light

288
00:25:57,489 --> 00:26:00,322
Where are you going?

289
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:12,361
It would have been difficult for a supirtaksi to pay for his children's schooling

290
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,203
What do you want?

291
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,345
What is your ability name?

292
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:26,272
What is Bilocation?

293
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:28,409
Supertition?

294
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,381
You can control electronic devices remotely, right?

295
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:34,321
I do not understand what you mean

296
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,452
Are you from the police?

297
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:41,231
I did not do anything - not at all.

298
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:47,300
I have a quote for you

299
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:53,401
He can read people's minds

300
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:58,407
That would really help you playing poker, right?

301
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:02,445
Can he also control the minds of people?

302
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:06,481
For example, desire to raise a stick?

303
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:08,348
Her name is Tamara

304
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:11,495
But he works side by side for secret police, in whatever country

305
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,364
But he is very old

306
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,298
Are you sure you want to bring it to the casino?

307
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:22,397
You need it. Hypnotist

308
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,298
His name is Kevin

309
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:28,278
But he's crazy

310
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:30,371
She has autism, that sort of thing

311
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:32,441
Her parents locked her up

312
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:34,477
The doctors used it

313
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,354
Whatever program will be depressed.

314
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:41,349
This is a good business for you

315
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,251
They'll do anything for Kevin.

316
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:51,502
He is 50 years old

317
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:55,303
No, he's only 45 years old

318
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:57,241
She just drank too much

319
00:27:58,276 --> 00:28:00,244
When he was drunk he would beat his wife

320
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:03,278
This is not the first time he has come to see you

321
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,380
But this time he came to see you

322
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:06,507
You plant the idea in his mind

323
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:08,317
So they do not drink

324
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:10,414
But it does not last long, right?

325
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:13,485
Can you get them to play?

326
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:20,493
Gambling will make their energy maximized in different ways

327
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:23,359
He will stop drinking, he will stop beating his wife

328
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:25,360
And everyone will be happy

329
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,484
let's play

330
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:53,421
TwoEnam

331
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,300
Add it

332
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:00,464
Kevin, come with me

333
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:04,236
Kevin, listen! We can be a good team, right?

334
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:06,207
- Yeah. You want me to take you away from here?

335
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:12,243
I want to, but they will not let me out.

336
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:16,344
- I'm supposed to help people. Nobody has the right to keep you here

337
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:18,421
You and I are going around the world

338
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:20,354
And help people play and win

339
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:27,354
Kevin, Kevin

340
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:30,334
I need help

341
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,259
Okay

342
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:35,363
Okay, let's go

343
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:39,401
Hey! Stop!

344
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:43,345
I said stop! Get him! - Come on!

345
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:45,312
They should give better food,

346
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:46,280
and cable TV

347
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:48,318
And let you go out into town

348
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:49,511
am I right? Say Yes!

349
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:51,455
The word ka n ya!

350
00:29:58,263 --> 00:29:59,389
Come on, we gotta go!

351
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,391
Do not stop fighting! You have the right!

352
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:37,257
5 DAYS

353
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:43,371
Well, we'll start doing business

354
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:47,471
What we will do is not break the law

355
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:50,313
No one is sure that this is possible

356
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:53,373
But the risk will get smaller if we do it as a team.

357
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:56,216
Casino does not recognize the team

358
00:30:57,388 --> 00:31:01,290
So we have to do it each

359
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:06,387
That's easy. Where will we start?

360
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:12,333
Craps, some players will turn, while others ...

361
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:15,363
put up bets, and everything is possible.

362
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:20,306
A good number to start

363
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:59,475
Okay, not bad for the initial experiment.

364
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:03,311
Okay, let's simulate the original casino.

365
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:07,358
Eric, if you play the dice, try not to attract too much attention.

366
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:09,493
If you see something unusual, raise your hand.

367
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:11,386
You two will help me at the poker table

368
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:15,261
No way, I have not done it for a long time.

369
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,461
Very good. Kevin

370
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:52,426
If you look like this in a casino,

371
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:55,406
Security will soon find out.

372
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:00,310
That's why we have Tony

373
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:02,436
Tony, did you see the camera on the side?

374
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:04,305
Can you divert it from us?

375
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:45,481
Okay

376
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:47,413
let's play

377
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:54,353
Where is the chip?

378
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:57,297
Give me 10, honey

379
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:00,429
Okay, here's the money

380
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,369
If it looks weird, I'll call for security

381
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:11,277
Okay Tony! Watch the camera

382
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:13,313
Kevin, distract

383
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,285
- Try to be more careful. - OK

384
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:19,482
I have a fullhouse

385
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:22,254
Shit!

386
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:33,269
Put your bets on!

387
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,448
This is mine

388
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,419
Leon!

389
00:34:58,296 --> 00:34:59,320
Okay, you're great!

390
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:01,295
Now try to continue without me

391
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:15,302
Okay, let's play!

392
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,436
Put your bets on!

393
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:22,242
I bet six. Put your bet!

394
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:28,482
- Kevin, you screwed it up. Here, just wear this. It costs 200 Euro

395
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:30,351
- Give it to me! -I do not want your watch

396
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:39,230
My eyes, I can not see whatsoever

397
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:42,438
What are you doing?

398
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:45,366
We'll play once more, okay?

399
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:50,313
Shit! Tony! I can see it! Switch the camera

400
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:51,506
What are you doing to me?

401
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:57,285
I will kill you! give it to me!

402
00:35:57,388 --> 00:35:58,446
What are you doing?

403
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:05,292
Shit!

404
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:16,466
I do not know, in their supervision somewhat orderly,

405
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,278
But somehow they can be stronger.

406
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,414
Makes me a little worried

407
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:30,515
What if we put a hearing aid in their ears.

408
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:33,356
Now this is not that much noticed anymore

409
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,331
Can he distract himself?

410
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:53,501
Tamara?

411
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:59,280
Where does he live?

412
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:34,512
4 DAYS

413
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:50,232
Veronica, you have to help me

414
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:51,425
You have to help me, Veronica!

415
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:53,427
- Tamara and I ... Do not bother me!

416
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:55,300
Whatever the price, I can pay

417
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:58,374
Come on Veronica. We do not have much time

418
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:48,449
Where is he? Where did he go?

419
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:03,430
I think you're missing something

420
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:06,443
I'm not their friend

421
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:19,289
Why are they chasing you?

422
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:24,223
Come on, I just want to help

423
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:26,225
And I have an offer for you

424
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:32,232
You can not even help yourself

425
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:34,403
The casino, your father

426
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:36,364
Go to hell!

427
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:39,435
Now I know why I have to chase you.

428
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,245
Why your grandma can live

429
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:46,375
He did it for the rest of his life, right?

430
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:50,283
And now no one is protecting you

431
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:54,291
I promise she'll be glad.

432
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:56,281
Please listen to me

433
00:39:56,394 --> 00:40:00,262
You can earn money, and start a new life, away from here

434
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:09,429
Excuse me sir, I lost my passport. Can you help me? I need your help!

435
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:39,359
This must be fate

436
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:41,460
Have you considered my offer?

437
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:46,466
Come on! Believe me, okay?

438
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,210
No

439
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:56,350
3 DAYS

440
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:24,278
Thinking is karmabagi yourself.

441
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:30,511
Is the exhibit finished?

442
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,380
Yes, I'm sorry sir. We're closed

443
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:36,384
Too bad I'm late. Akudatang from afar and my plane delay

444
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,257
Sorry

445
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:40,455
The hypnotist will come to you

446
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:43,491
And will sendmuke the unconscious world.

447
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:47,370
Find a room under your subconscious for the person you need

448
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:50,234
And now, they are in your power

449
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:52,432
N0m0l` Satll

450
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:54,478
Number two

451
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:07,424
But remember

452
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,485
You only have a few minutes

453
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:37,215
Can you stand up, sir?

454
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:39,347
Can you stand up?

455
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:44,385
I am fine

456
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:45,523
Everything is alright

457
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,456
Hey, why did you go there?

458
00:42:49,466 --> 00:42:51,366
Forgive me!

459
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:53,496
Yes, of course

460
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,529
Incredible, almost like the original copy.

461
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:27,497
I do not know how I made it

462
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:33,238
This is your unintentional masterpiece.

463
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:35,375
Extraordinary

464
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:39,409
I'll give you 500 Europads to buy this painting

465
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,342
Agree?

466
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,310
Agree

467
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:03,464
You are a wonderful friend

468
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:09,437
Can you shut up for a minute?

469
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,213
Can we talk?

470
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:17,283
Too many people are here

471
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:26,354
I have to go

472
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:36,236
All right, everybody

473
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,498
This is Veronica

474
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:41,377
I do not know how, but he can read and transmit thoughts.

475
00:44:42,379 --> 00:44:44,438
He will come in our game

476
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:50,252
Before we enter the casino, we must make sure to dance in the same rhythm.

477
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:54,224
Veronica, you say there are too many people here?

478
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,457
I think I have an idea

479
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:03,455
Let's dance

480
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,330
Get Eric to hit the Konceng! - Eric, the bell!

481
00:46:25,382 --> 00:46:30,479
Tell Kevin to make 2 people shout for help- Kevin tells 2 people to shout for help!

482
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:38,484
Please

483
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:45,492
Get Tony to make a short-circuit-Tony, shorted!

484
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:02,217
Veronica, we need an earthquake now everybody goes from this field.

485
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:08,254
Earthquake

486
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:12,294
Earthquake

487
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:15,320
Earthquake!

488
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:20,425
Earthquake!

489
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:24,372
Earthquake!

490
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:26,266
Earthquake!

491
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,366
Not bad either

492
00:47:56,506 --> 00:47:58,303
I'll treat you to a drink

493
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:11,353
All right, here's the plan

494
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:13,489
If we start by winning in small amounts.

495
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,260
It will take a long time

496
00:48:18,528 --> 00:48:21,326
We can bi blakclist with ease, and it will harm us

497
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:25,332
That's why we're going to the biggest and richest kasinopaling in town.

498
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:28,361
They do not set limits on how many bets you can install

499
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:35,409
Which means ... One night one big advantage.

500
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:43,446
We'll all go in separately

501
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:47,313
They should not know when we are in a team.

502
00:48:53,463 --> 00:48:57,263
Tony, you're going to be a transportation manager.

503
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:58,492
and security consultants

504
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:06,238
Kevin, you deserve to be the heir to the treasure.

505
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:12,282
Eric, you can be yourself

506
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:15,251
Spend your dad's money- That's easy.

507
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:27,489
And you ... will be my fiancee

508
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:32,366
Hug me, kiss me, very convincingly

509
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:36,203
You will support me even if I lose

510
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:43,436
Is that why you're taking me along? - That's just a small part.

511
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:07,300
You all ready?

512
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:39,332
2 DAYS

513
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:38,519
Tell Tony to switch the camera

514
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:40,420
Tony, the camera!

515
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:54,308
Okay, we need 10. Tell Eric-Eric, take out 10.

516
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:13,395
Okay

517
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:18,229
This must be my lucky day

518
00:52:34,351 --> 00:52:36,251
Eric, it's your turn!

519
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:41,256
We seem to be good too, what do you think?

520
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:43,323
What do you mean?

521
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:47,287
You and me, we're both matchmaking

522
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:49,260
What do you think?

523
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:52,230
You forgot something

524
00:52:52,435 --> 00:52:54,266
I hear all your thoughts

525
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:56,271
Look, we're like the ideal couple

526
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,405
We can understand each other whatsoever.

527
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,239
It will not be easy

528
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:03,436
But we will find a way

529
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:16,281
F, my friends. Some say if you are lucky to work, usually you are not lucky in loving |

530
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:20,224
This is for you

531
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,331
Eric, do not go anywhere We still have not won.

532
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:25,523
Good luck, gentlemen

533
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,285
Kevin, look at his eyes!

534
00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:07,498
Tony, the camera!

535
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:36,268
Not bad!

536
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,249
Congratulations, sir

537
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:12,263
I'm back playing

538
00:55:13,276 --> 00:55:14,504
Let's plug it in!

539
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:22,314
Very good!

540
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:30,356
Yes dear!

541
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:34,397
What does he do? He has to stop drinking

542
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:38,233
Do not worry, Michael. Everything will be fine

543
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:40,291
Just enjoy yourself

544
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:42,403
Everything is habist no bet again.

545
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:44,268
All right, Michael

546
00:55:51,548 --> 00:55:53,379
Tony, stop it! Later we are caught!

547
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:03,424
I'll get the Jackpot! - Tony, no Jackpots!

548
00:56:05,495 --> 00:56:07,463

549
00:56:09,499 --> 00:56:11,490
Sir, come with me - What's wrong?

550
00:56:12,302 --> 00:56:13,428
What is wrong?

551
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:15,464
Hey, I want to take my money!

552
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,305
Sir, please come with me- Wait a minute!

553
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:22,206
I said, please follow me!

554
00:56:52,475 --> 00:56:54,340
What happened?

555
00:57:00,483 --> 00:57:02,451
Are you guys crazy?

556
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:08,414
If you want your corpse found in an underground with an outlet,

557
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:10,418
just go ahead and do it

558
00:57:11,294 --> 00:57:14,320
And soon you will be the security officer's month

559
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:18,367
But if you want to get out of here alive

560
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:20,492
Rich

561
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:53,436
Live, healthy, and rich

562
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:55,428
Follow what I say!

563
00:57:56,406 --> 00:57:58,237
You understand?

564
00:58:01,411 --> 00:58:03,242
Meet me at the tableCrabs, in five minutes

565
00:58:29,405 --> 00:58:30,497
May I join?

566
00:58:42,452 --> 00:58:44,352
Kevin, look at his eyes!

567
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:49,316
Tony, the camera

568
00:59:33,336 --> 00:59:34,428
This is for you

569
00:59:36,372 --> 00:59:37,464
Come on!

570
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:05,260
APa7

571
01:01:12,468 --> 01:01:15,232
That is all?

572
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:23,274
I thought maybe we could do another job.

573
01:01:23,546 --> 01:01:26,413
Something easy

574
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:29,450
It seems you like it

575
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:32,421
Then we can split up

576
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:37,316
There are many easy jobs waiting to be done.

577
01:01:39,462 --> 01:01:43,364
What do you think?

578
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:46,267
We make a pretty good team

579
01:01:51,474 --> 01:01:55,342
It will never end for you

580
01:01:56,446 --> 01:02:01,281
Besides, I do not need money

581
01:02:10,293 --> 01:02:15,321
No need money? That is interesting

582
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:18,391
No one needs money, but everyone wants it.

583
01:02:20,436 --> 01:02:24,270
Why are you still here?

584
01:02:24,474 --> 01:02:30,208
You can go anytime want from scratch

585
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:32,510
if you do not need money

586
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:37,485
Because it's not like you

587
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:43,392
You think you're a great professional

588
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:46,293
who knew the word took risks

589
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:50,365
You're just a selfish gambler who's stuck in their own bad habits.

590
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:55,268
You see yourself in a dark hole

591
01:02:55,304 --> 01:02:58,330
play a role as a savior of yourself.

592
01:03:07,316 --> 01:03:10,410
So now, no thanks

593
01:03:14,524 --> 01:03:17,425
Maybe you're right

594
01:03:21,364 --> 01:03:24,333
We should leave it like this

595
01:03:33,376 --> 01:03:36,243
And you live in your cocoon

596
01:03:36,279 --> 01:03:38,440
But nothing

597
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:42,508
Only you, your fear, your music, and nothing else

598
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:48,323
There was no hope

599
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:58,494
I want to save you You learn a lot.

600
01:03:58,534 --> 01:04:02,231
But this is where our students have to stop.

601
01:04:04,307 --> 01:04:09,335
You want to say I have a ball?

602
01:04:10,313 --> 01:04:12,440
I can not let you go any further

603
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:15,382
Remember what I said about not taking part in this?

604
01:04:15,384 --> 01:04:19,320
Yes. I'm working on it

605
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:24,254
It takes longer than I think

606
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:32,358
- How's he doing? - He made a lot of progress

607
01:04:33,269 --> 01:04:37,262
Besides, she's not alone anymore. Not for long

608
01:04:37,273 --> 01:04:40,367
He will not stay together for a long time.

609
01:04:42,345 --> 01:04:44,370
Who was with him?

610
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:47,247
A professional person?

611
01:04:47,283 --> 01:04:49,478
These people are involved in the same thing that we do

612
01:04:49,485 --> 01:04:52,352
On your advice, of course

613
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:56,290
I hope he comes to me on his own free will

614
01:04:56,292 --> 01:05:00,285
But we have to play it in a different way.

615
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:05,390
If a person can not have his own way

616
01:05:07,436 --> 01:05:10,405
he has to give up

617
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:21,374
DAY 1

618
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:04,384
What do you want?

619
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:10,296
Come on

620
01:06:28,284 --> 01:06:30,411
I try to get rid of them

621
01:06:42,264 --> 01:06:44,232
Faster!

622
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:07,387
Sorry, Michael

623
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:27,436
You really are a champ

624
01:07:28,344 --> 01:07:30,369
You surprised me

625
01:07:31,514 --> 01:07:34,506
I have your money. Take it

626
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:38,281
I've taken it

627
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:45,517
But these people are more valuable to me

628
01:07:58,274 --> 01:08:00,504
I will never work for you

629
01:08:06,282 --> 01:08:08,443
What can you do?

630
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:12,345
Maybe turn that weapon into a banana.

631
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:16,315
Wow, really?

632
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:19,325
Really?

633
01:08:26,368 --> 01:08:28,393
Not every time it works

634
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:35,240
Come on

635
01:08:39,348 --> 01:08:43,307
Michael, I want to let you go

636
01:08:43,352 --> 01:08:46,253
but I'm afraid they will not

637
01:08:46,255 --> 01:08:49,349
the situation is quite serious

638
01:08:50,493 --> 01:08:53,257
Sorry

639
01:08:54,497 --> 01:08:57,466
No. Wait./No!

640
01:09:03,405 --> 01:09:05,236
Michael!

641
01:10:41,503 --> 01:10:43,437
Bastard

642
01:10:52,348 --> 01:10:56,307
What? You?

643
01:10:56,452 --> 01:10:58,352
What the hell?

644
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:06,328
Oh, I see. Now it makes sense

645
01:11:06,328 --> 01:11:09,388
From the beginning is you! I can not believe it!

646
01:11:09,398 --> 01:11:10,422
Everything is you!

647
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:12,423
I have not seen you for 10 years, and you showed up,

648
01:11:12,468 --> 01:11:15,437
and you ruined my best operation!

649
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:19,339
I hope you come to see me

650
01:11:19,341 --> 01:11:23,368
For your information, others do that

651
01:11:23,412 --> 01:11:26,347
They went to Paris with their problems

652
01:11:27,549 --> 01:11:30,245
And they do not have a team of psychic power

653
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:32,243
to rob a casino

654
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:36,258
That's why you do that?

655
01:11:36,258 --> 01:11:38,522
You should realize I'll never come for you

656
01:11:38,527 --> 01:11:41,360
Bring me back

657
01:11:41,363 --> 01:11:44,332
Michael, you have not talked to me for 10 years!

658
01:11:46,268 --> 01:11:48,463
I do not know what to do

659
01:11:50,439 --> 01:11:52,430
OK

660
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:55,501
Maybe it's not the best idea, but what else can I do?

661
01:11:55,544 --> 01:11:59,275
I have no idea. You can call

662
01:12:00,416 --> 01:12:05,251
Somehow, I did not think about it

663
01:12:05,387 --> 01:12:08,254
But I saved your life, did not I?

664
01:12:08,257 --> 01:12:10,282
No. You set me up

665
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:12,351
Same as you didribuan times before.

666
01:12:12,361 --> 01:12:14,261
What are you talking about?

667
01:12:14,296 --> 01:12:16,423
That is your education

668
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:21,458
Do you remember what happened first?

669
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:24,438
You accept all this very negative.

670
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:26,340
Really?

671
01:12:28,477 --> 01:12:34,382
OK. Maybe I'm a little overwhelmed

672
01:12:34,416 --> 01:12:36,384
A little too much?

673
01:12:37,319 --> 01:12:40,413
Michael. Michael!

674
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:54,496
Michael, do you remember how we dream

675
01:12:54,503 --> 01:12:58,439
one day find the door on the wall?

676
01:13:00,342 --> 01:13:04,472
I remember the story. Do you remember that?

677
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:08,350
Why did you say this to me?

678
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:11,342
Because I know where to find it.

679
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:14,447
You have 30 minutes for lunch

680
01:13:27,469 --> 01:13:29,403
Drain

681
01:13:29,438 --> 01:13:32,271
He needs to see something

682
01:13:33,475 --> 01:13:39,345
Maybe he can drug at the hospital. She's getting worse

683
01:13:39,381 --> 01:13:41,508
We should not take him to the clinic

684
01:13:41,517 --> 01:13:46,250
We should do a lot of things differently

685
01:13:49,391 --> 01:13:51,291
Tony?

686
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:03,462
Hello? / Hey, what's up?

687
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:06,305
The toilet was clogged

688
01:14:09,311 --> 01:14:11,506
How can?

689
01:14:12,481 --> 01:14:16,349
God, Michael! - I have nine lives

690
01:14:16,351 --> 01:14:19,218
What the fuck? - Michael!

691
01:14:19,254 --> 01:14:21,245
We're crazy. - What are you

692
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:23,258
Long story. Later

693
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:25,283
I'll get you out of here

694
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:27,455
And also the money

695
01:14:29,264 --> 01:14:31,425
Where is Veronika?

696
01:14:32,501 --> 01:14:38,440
He refused to work for Victor

697
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:42,308
He's been in a coma for a few days now.

698
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:45,337
He goes to his subconscious

699
01:15:02,297 --> 01:15:05,232
Fuck it. I stopped

700
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:07,427
I also

701
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:11,329
Do whatever you want

702
01:15:16,411 --> 01:15:20,279
Take them downstairs. I'll be down soon

703
01:15:20,282 --> 01:15:23,274
and handle them on their own

704
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:30,287
Get rid of your hand

705
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:34,386
Keep an eye on the door

706
01:15:50,245 --> 01:15:51,507
Come on

707
01:16:04,293 --> 01:16:06,420
Please open the door

708
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:36,357
Extraordinary. Now what?

709
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:40,387
Now you open the safe. You have 5 minutes.

710
01:16:43,465 --> 01:16:45,456
Where is he?

711
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:48,469
Above, in the hotel, room 209

712
01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:52,399
Good luck!

713
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:18,265
I can not turn them off

714
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:21,394
but I can turn some off

715
01:17:21,403 --> 01:17:25,339
What? Are you kidding?

716
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:27,308
Ka u ta kut?

717
01:17:32,247 --> 01:17:33,407
I hate Twister

718
01:18:46,488 --> 01:18:49,218
OK

719
01:18:49,257 --> 01:18:51,316
Come on in action

720
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:20,312
Come on. How much longer?

721
01:19:20,322 --> 01:19:22,449
Tell me // faster. - Let's hurry

722
01:19:22,491 --> 01:19:26,393
Tell me how much longer. - Stop talking. Let me work!

723
01:19:53,388 --> 01:19:56,289
What the hell, Jack ?! This is us!

724
01:19:57,526 --> 01:20:01,326
Oh, shit./ Let's go to work!

725
01:20:06,434 --> 01:20:09,369
Come on. Please

726
01:20:13,308 --> 01:20:15,276
I love you, dear

727
01:20:47,342 --> 01:20:49,207
Perfect

728
01:20:49,244 --> 01:20:51,405
What next?

729
01:20:53,481 --> 01:20:55,472
That is all

730
01:20:57,519 --> 01:20:59,384
APa7

731
01:21:00,388 --> 01:21:02,288
APa7

732
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:06,293
What do you mean, that's it?

733
01:21:06,328 --> 01:21:08,489
We are confined in steel tombs

734
01:21:08,496 --> 01:21:11,260
with a bunch of armed guards outside,

735
01:21:11,299 --> 01:21:13,460
and you're gonna tell me you're over here?

736
01:21:13,468 --> 01:21:16,403
This is a place in the entire casino

737
01:21:16,404 --> 01:21:19,373
They can not catch us in here.

738
01:21:21,343 --> 01:21:23,436
And now I have to pick up Veronika.

739
01:21:25,347 --> 01:21:28,373
Shit! He tricked us

740
01:21:28,383 --> 01:21:30,351
The game is over

741
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:32,376
I need you guys to help pick up Veronika,

742
01:21:32,387 --> 01:21:34,321
wherever he is

743
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:42,396
You're normal. You're not like us

744
01:21:43,365 --> 01:21:46,232
Continue?

745
01:21:46,268 --> 01:21:48,259
We all have space

746
01:21:48,370 --> 01:21:51,362
That's how I can pick her up, is not she?

747
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:54,500
Even though you got there

748
01:21:54,509 --> 01:21:56,477
not sure you will get the ability

749
01:21:57,312 --> 01:21:58,506
I do not need them

750
01:21:58,513 --> 01:22:02,279
You're not ready for this

751
01:22:02,317 --> 01:22:04,410
You will die

752
01:22:04,419 --> 01:22:06,478
No one knows that for sure

753
01:22:09,324 --> 01:22:11,519
But that was the only chance I had

754
01:22:11,526 --> 01:22:14,393
that you have

755
01:22:15,363 --> 01:22:18,491
All we have

756
01:22:24,306 --> 01:22:27,366
I need you to help pick up Veronika.

757
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:32,310
- I do not know how. - Kevin, listen to me.

758
01:22:32,314 --> 01:22:34,373
Get me into my subconscious

759
01:22:43,391 --> 01:22:45,484
Let him try

760
01:22:49,431 --> 01:22:51,399
Okay

761
01:23:09,451 --> 01:23:14,286
When they come out, kill them all

762
01:24:37,272 --> 01:24:39,433
Mom, why do you always have to go?

763
01:24:39,441 --> 01:24:41,466
When you go home?

764
01:24:43,445 --> 01:24:47,438
Nothing. Just you, your fear

765
01:24:47,449 --> 01:24:50,247
your music, and nothing else

766
01:24:50,285 --> 01:24:52,378
There was no hope

767
01:24:53,388 --> 01:24:56,357
Raise your hands! You're under arrest!

768
01:24:56,357 --> 01:24:58,484
Put your hand where I can see it.

769
01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:06,266
You're just a selfish gambler who's stuck in their own bad habits.

770
01:25:09,237 --> 01:25:13,367
Guilty. You were sentenced to six months in a juvenile prison.

771
01:28:12,387 --> 01:28:19,316
Veronika. Where are you?

772
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:12,431
Veronika

773
01:30:13,508 --> 01:30:16,306
Veronika, we have to go

774
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:21,448
What are you doing?

775
01:30:24,318 --> 01:30:26,445
Veronika, can you hear me?

776
01:30:26,487 --> 01:30:28,455
What are you doing, Veronika?

777
01:30:30,458 --> 01:30:33,256
We have to go. Listen to me

778
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:35,422
We have no time. We must go!

779
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,468
Veronika!

780
01:30:42,370 --> 01:30:43,359
Shit!

781
01:30:57,285 --> 01:30:59,515
You can not hear me

782
01:31:09,430 --> 01:31:12,399
I know how to hear me.

783
01:31:45,399 --> 01:31:49,233
Veronika

784
01:31:57,345 --> 01:32:02,248
Veronika, we have to go. Now

785
01:32:04,318 --> 01:32:06,479
Can you feel that?

786
01:32:06,521 --> 01:32:09,388
What are you talking about?

787
01:32:11,459 --> 01:32:15,395
I do not know I can feel a world like this

788
01:32:15,429 --> 01:32:18,262
Veronika, listen to meThe feeling is not real

789
01:32:18,299 --> 01:32:20,267
You must come with me

790
01:32:22,303 --> 01:32:24,396
Michael, you're dead

791
01:32:25,273 --> 01:32:28,470
I'm real, and I'm alive. - Calm down

792
01:32:29,277 --> 01:32:31,370
Stay with me

793
01:32:31,412 --> 01:32:33,403
Veronika, listen to me. You have to believe me

794
01:32:34,348 --> 01:32:37,408
I do not have much time

795
01:32:42,490 --> 01:32:45,323
How about this?

796
01:33:27,501 --> 01:33:30,265
I do not go

797
01:33:30,304 --> 01:33:32,431
I do not have anything there

798
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:35,307
I do not go without you

799
01:33:36,477 --> 01:33:41,471
Besides you, I do not have anything there

800
01:33:44,352 --> 01:33:47,344
Trust me

801
01:33:49,490 --> 01:33:51,481
Why did you do it?

802
01:34:11,379 --> 01:34:14,246
APa7

803
01:34:18,419 --> 01:34:20,387
You're risking your life for me

804
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:25,257
You know, in every human life

805
01:34:32,333 --> 01:34:37,293
there are certain limits

806
01:34:37,304 --> 01:34:40,239
you can not get past.

807
01:34:40,508 --> 01:34:42,408
What is it because rasatakutut, or just because

808
01:34:42,443 --> 01:34:45,310
he could not believe it was possible

809
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:48,507
Then I met you

810
01:34:49,383 --> 01:34:51,476
And here I am

811
01:34:51,519 --> 01:34:54,511
Beyond all the limits in my mind,

812
01:34:54,522 --> 01:34:56,490
and all I can believe

813
01:34:56,490 --> 01:35:01,427
I think to be with you forever, but that's impossible

814
01:35:09,537 --> 01:35:13,473
It's the door. Let's go

815
01:35:17,244 --> 01:35:19,474
For me the way it works is not like that. / What?

816
01:35:19,513 --> 01:35:22,380
Why? - I have to find my own way out.

817
01:35:22,416 --> 01:35:24,281
I'll come with you. - No

818
01:35:24,285 --> 01:35:28,221
If you do not go now all this will be in vain.

819
01:35:29,457 --> 01:35:32,483
When you wake up, I'll be there

820
01:35:32,493 --> 01:35:35,291
waiting for you

821
01:35:35,329 --> 01:35:39,356
You said you'd believe me, right? Yes, right?

822
01:36:21,442 --> 01:36:24,275
Michael

823
01:36:25,379 --> 01:36:27,313
Michael

824
01:36:35,356 --> 01:36:39,292
These doors, each of them are

825
01:36:39,326 --> 01:36:41,385
entrance to someone's house

826
01:36:41,395 --> 01:36:46,332
someone's apartment. There are a lot of people who live there.

827
01:36:47,301 --> 01:36:52,295
Some of them are very good, others are not so good.

828
01:36:52,439 --> 01:36:56,466
You go in and give them a suitcase full of money

829
01:36:56,477 --> 01:36:58,411
their lives will change

830
01:36:58,445 --> 01:37:01,312
If you go in and take their savings

831
01:37:01,315 --> 01:37:03,283
their lives will also change

832
01:37:03,284 --> 01:37:05,309
But in a different way

833
01:37:05,486 --> 01:37:09,320
I know. But these doors

834
01:37:10,257 --> 01:37:12,452
They are closed to us We are ordinary people.

835
01:37:12,493 --> 01:37:15,360
Each apartment has one door.

836
01:37:15,396 --> 01:37:18,422
Everyone should live in his chance.

837
01:37:19,366 --> 01:37:25,430
Michael, it will have all the knowledge

838
01:37:25,472 --> 01:37:28,407
and the secrets of humanity

839
01:37:28,442 --> 01:37:35,371
Everything that ever existed in everyone's mind, dead or alive

840
01:37:36,417 --> 01:37:40,285
Now, can you imagine the possibilities?

841
01:37:41,355 --> 01:37:43,482
We can learn anything we want.

842
01:37:43,490 --> 01:37:46,323
We can get whatever we want

843
01:37:47,361 --> 01:37:53,391
Please do not tell me how to think about a new business.

844
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:58,394
The business is our life. - Damn it

845
01:37:58,405 --> 01:38:01,465
Are not we too old for this?

846
01:38:01,508 --> 01:38:03,339
Maybe

847
01:38:03,344 --> 01:38:07,474
And, there is one problem

848
01:38:09,350 --> 01:38:14,287
Even all the great people who have been there have failed to return

849
01:38:15,389 --> 01:38:21,453
8 minutes is how long you can survive there alone.

850
01:38:22,396 --> 01:38:26,457
Then you start to forget your own existence.

851
01:38:26,467 --> 01:38:29,459
In the end, your mind is gone

852
01:38:29,503 --> 01:38:32,336
united with billions of previous thoughts.

853
01:38:32,339 --> 01:38:38,209
You'll never get back to your senses

854
01:38:38,245 --> 01:38:41,339
if someone does not remind you who you are

855
01:38:41,382 --> 01:38:45,375
So, I need a partner

856
01:38:45,519 --> 01:38:48,386
So you brought me here

857
01:38:48,389 --> 01:38:51,256
just because you need me again

858
01:38:52,259 --> 01:38:55,490
You always want to know what's behind a white door, do not you?

859
01:38:55,529 --> 01:38:58,327
I thought about it, then I realized

860
01:38:58,332 --> 01:39:02,393
the only person I can trust is you

861
01:39:02,503 --> 01:39:05,267
You do not understand, huh?

862
01:39:05,306 --> 01:39:09,367
Because of you, I involve some good people into trouble.

863
01:39:11,378 --> 01:39:18,284
I still feel uncomfortable with the problem I caused

864
01:39:19,420 --> 01:39:25,484
I want to help you, as your father

865
01:39:27,294 --> 01:39:33,255
Now, there is one man. You know him

866
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:35,461
But this time, she will be on your side

867
01:39:35,502 --> 01:39:39,438
And you have to share it with him. Take it.

868
01:39:40,307 --> 01:39:42,502
This will be your compass

869
01:39:43,310 --> 01:39:47,303
I think this is something you need for the rest of your life.

870
01:39:48,382 --> 01:39:53,410
All my life I need a father, but yes,

871
01:39:53,420 --> 01:39:55,479
this is also good. thank you

872
01:39:56,357 --> 01:40:01,454
By the way, do not forget about my part.

873
01:40:02,296 --> 01:40:05,322
This does not mean I'm going to be your partner

874
01:40:06,467 --> 01:40:08,367
I am just kidding

875
01:40:08,402 --> 01:40:10,495
No. I'm not kidding

876
01:40:11,438 --> 01:40:15,465
I am just kidding. You're a good boy

877
01:41:19,373 --> 01:41:23,241
Now you know who you are and what you can do.

878
01:41:24,344 --> 01:41:28,212
We are in your memory. I pull you out.

879
01:41:28,248 --> 01:41:29,374
Now finish yourself

880
01:41:29,416 --> 01:41:31,407
How can I save them?

881
01:41:31,418 --> 01:41:33,352
Look into it

882
01:41:33,387 --> 01:41:35,480
and try to capture the essence

883
01:41:41,361 --> 01:41:43,488
Sometimes there is more truth in the illusion,

884
01:41:43,530 --> 01:41:45,395
than in reality

885
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:49,469
The key to the problem apapundi in one's mind

886
01:41:49,503 --> 01:41:52,370
is stepping the right kind of downright.

887
01:41:53,273 --> 01:41:54,501
No, no!

888
01:41:54,508 --> 01:41:56,373
Wait!

889
01:41:58,445 --> 01:41:59,412
No!

890
01:42:15,462 --> 01:42:18,329
Sorry, I'm stuck

891
01:42:21,401 --> 01:42:25,235
Michael./Michael

892
01:42:27,474 --> 01:42:31,274
Take the money. We're leaving.

893
01:42:31,311 --> 01:42:32,369
You lie to me again

894
01:42:32,479 --> 01:42:35,346
Believe me, it will not happen again

895
01:42:36,316 --> 01:42:39,251
Tony

896
01:42:41,255 --> 01:42:43,280
Michael, are you crazy?

897
01:42:43,490 --> 01:42:46,459
They will kill us

898
01:42:49,463 --> 01:42:52,227
You gonna believe me?

899
01:43:36,276 --> 01:43:39,336
Fraud is also a game

900
01:43:42,516 --> 01:43:47,249
And the better you know your opponent

901
01:43:48,322 --> 01:43:50,517
... the more money you can win

902
01:43:52,259 --> 01:43:54,352
But let me tell you

903
01:43:55,362 --> 01:43:57,330
ni?

904
01:43:57,331 --> 01:44:00,459
This is only part of my plan

905
01:44:02,502 --> 01:44:06,438
But the greatest art is to control your enemies

906
01:44:09,509 --> 01:44:14,412
And the key to your victory is in his head.

907
01:44:18,418 --> 01:44:22,286
What are the major weaknesses of the subconscious

908
01:44:22,322 --> 01:44:25,348
like a bulletproof safe?

909
01:44:27,361 --> 01:44:29,226
That is why

910
01:44:29,363 --> 01:44:32,423
He's afraid of losing everything

911
01:44:42,242 --> 01:44:44,233
And this?

912
01:44:44,278 --> 01:44:48,237
This is the end of my plan

913
01:45:09,369 --> 01:45:12,497
They descend from the other side. Everything is out, now

914
01:45:12,539 --> 01:45:14,302
They escaped

915
01:45:14,308 --> 01:45:15,434
All!

916
01:45:51,345 --> 01:45:53,370
This is yours

917
01:45:56,350 --> 01:45:59,319
Good work, everybody

918
01:46:00,387 --> 01:46:02,480
I think your talent should be better utilized

919
01:46:02,489 --> 01:46:05,322
rather than robbing the casino

920
01:46:06,259 --> 01:46:09,319
I have a suggestion for all of you

921
01:46:20,340 --> 01:46:23,309
3 MONTHS LATER

922
01:46:35,255 --> 01:46:37,382
Do it. I paid 5 million for that

923
01:46:37,391 --> 01:46:39,416
Wait. That's mine. - No. I hired you

924
01:46:39,459 --> 01:46:40,426
