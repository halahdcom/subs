2
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:42,687
Most definitely,
it's just a real long road.

3
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:43,904
It's a really
fucking long road.

4
00:00:43,906 --> 00:00:46,210
- It's really far out, isn't it?
- Yeah.

5
00:00:46,721 --> 00:00:48,287
It's nice though.

6
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:49,503
I couldn't live down here.

7
00:00:49,505 --> 00:00:52,030
No way. I want to stay
in the city.

8
00:00:52,032 --> 00:00:53,568
Yeah.

9
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,936
Ger's been sleeping
the whole time, has he?

10
00:00:55,938 --> 00:00:57,152
- Is he still asleep?
- Yeah.

11
00:00:57,154 --> 00:00:58,115
Leave him at it.

12
00:01:00,321 --> 00:01:02,754
Hopefully the
weekend will do him good.

13
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,632
- Is this it?
- Yeah.

14
00:01:05,634 --> 00:01:07,391
Oh, my God,
is that a...

15
00:01:07,393 --> 00:01:08,447
It is.

16
00:01:09,665 --> 00:01:11,230
It's gorgeous.

17
00:01:11,232 --> 00:01:12,383
Oh, look.

18
00:01:12,385 --> 00:01:13,731
This is nice!

19
00:01:17,634 --> 00:01:19,423
Will you promise
to behave yourself?

20
00:01:19,425 --> 00:01:22,015
Yeah, I'll do my best.

21
00:01:22,017 --> 00:01:23,231
Just don't drink so much.

22
00:01:23,233 --> 00:01:26,272
The country is the place for mischief.
I'm a mischievous guy!

23
00:01:27,553 --> 00:01:29,823
I don't want to go
against my nature.

24
00:01:29,825 --> 00:01:31,359
There they are.

25
00:01:31,361 --> 00:01:32,322
Looking well.

26
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:38,305
Jesus Christ, lads!

27
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,898
What the hell
is that smell, huh?

28
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:42,913
It's getting worse.

29
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:49,567
- Hi!
- Hi. How are you?

30
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:51,168
Lovely to see you.

31
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,609
You missed the news so.

32
00:01:53,442 --> 00:01:54,336
Hello!

33
00:01:54,338 --> 00:01:57,662
Oh, come here, guys,
the place looks amazing!

34
00:01:57,664 --> 00:02:00,159
It's in the middle of nowhere,
it's so isolated.

35
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,598
You could get up to anything.

36
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,456
As usual the two of you
look impeccable.

37
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:04,478
Thank you.

38
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,944
But the stink is really bad.

39
00:02:06,946 --> 00:02:08,896
Seriously,
what is that stench?

40
00:02:08,898 --> 00:02:10,751
Is there a pig farm near by?

41
00:02:10,753 --> 00:02:12,639
It's a sinkhole.

42
00:02:12,641 --> 00:02:14,113
It was all over the news.

43
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:16,162
What, you're not serious?

44
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,430
Yeah.

45
00:02:18,432 --> 00:02:20,416
Hi, how are you?

46
00:02:20,418 --> 00:02:23,327
- So this is the famous holiday home.
- Yeah.

47
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:24,290
It's nice.

48
00:02:25,505 --> 00:02:28,159
Listen, I'm sorry
to hear about Barbara.

49
00:02:28,161 --> 00:02:30,113
- How are you holding up?
- Yeah, well...

50
00:02:31,138 --> 00:02:32,099
Fine I suppose.

51
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,873
It ran it's course.
Or so she said.

52
00:02:38,593 --> 00:02:40,544
Well, I'm glad
you could make it.

53
00:02:40,546 --> 00:02:41,823
Me too.

54
00:02:41,825 --> 00:02:44,479
Even if it does
stink down here.

55
00:02:44,481 --> 00:02:45,535
Oh, God.

56
00:02:45,537 --> 00:02:46,528
It's typical.

57
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,376
The one weekend I manage
to get everybody here.

58
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:50,655
You're not serious, though.

59
00:02:50,657 --> 00:02:52,191
It's beyond the woods.

60
00:02:52,193 --> 00:02:54,431
It's over by the old mines
on the mountain.

61
00:02:54,433 --> 00:02:55,455
We should go take a look.

62
00:02:55,457 --> 00:02:56,512
How far away?

63
00:02:56,514 --> 00:02:57,344
It's far

64
00:02:57,346 --> 00:02:59,966
and people
aren't allowed near it.

65
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,528
It's burning hot, and that
smell that you're getting

66
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,616
that's sulfur.

67
00:03:03,618 --> 00:03:06,945
They say coal spontaneously
combusted or something.

68
00:03:07,874 --> 00:03:09,570
We'll make the most of it.

69
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:12,446
We'll stay indoors.

70
00:03:12,448 --> 00:03:13,598
Have you been up there?

71
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,974
God no.

72
00:03:14,976 --> 00:03:18,432
If it stinks that bad two miles
away, it must be pungent near it.

73
00:03:18,434 --> 00:03:23,103
Peter the sergeant told us his crowd have
the whole place sealed off. For safety.

74
00:03:23,105 --> 00:03:26,880
Apparently it's actually
over 800 degrees there.

75
00:03:26,882 --> 00:03:28,063
Jesus.

76
00:03:28,065 --> 00:03:29,662
Yeah, I know.

77
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,872
They're calling it
the gates of hell!

78
00:03:32,866 --> 00:03:35,200
Now I really have to go
take a look now.

79
00:03:35,202 --> 00:03:36,575
We should head inside.

80
00:03:36,577 --> 00:03:38,431
That stink is nauseating.

81
00:03:38,433 --> 00:03:40,256
Yeah, yeah.

82
00:03:40,258 --> 00:03:41,312
I'll just grab some bags.

83
00:03:41,314 --> 00:03:42,275
I'll give you a hand.

84
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:49,858
Okay you guys are in here.

85
00:03:51,618 --> 00:03:53,918
Oh, wow, it's gorgeous,
thank you so much.

86
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,782
I need a beer.

87
00:03:54,784 --> 00:03:57,470
Oh, well, then
I'll follow you down.

88
00:03:57,472 --> 00:03:58,658
Ger, you're in the box room.

89
00:04:01,377 --> 00:04:03,647
I know it's small.
I hope you don't mind.

90
00:04:03,649 --> 00:04:05,857
No. I can sleep anywhere.

91
00:04:07,586 --> 00:04:09,182
Come down
when you're ready, okay?

92
00:04:09,184 --> 00:04:10,177
Thanks.

93
00:04:22,242 --> 00:04:23,487
Hey man, want one?

94
00:04:23,489 --> 00:04:24,450
Sure, beer me.

95
00:04:34,144 --> 00:04:35,201
I tell you,

96
00:04:37,088 --> 00:04:39,646
with that stink
and the road closures

97
00:04:39,648 --> 00:04:41,599
we could be in the house a lot

98
00:04:41,601 --> 00:04:42,847
As long as there's
plenty of this,

99
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,862
I don't really give a shit.

100
00:04:44,864 --> 00:04:46,559
Finally. Friday night, eh?

101
00:04:46,561 --> 00:04:47,746
- Friday night.
- Friday night.

102
00:04:50,176 --> 00:04:51,262
- Mm.
- It's nice.

103
00:04:51,264 --> 00:04:52,354
- Yeah, it's good.
- Strong.

104
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:18,402
It's nice though. It's nice.

105
00:05:20,001 --> 00:05:21,472
I suppose it's better than
being outside anyway.

106
00:05:21,474 --> 00:05:23,166
I know.

107
00:05:23,168 --> 00:05:24,831
I was just thinking

108
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,714
when was the last time we were
properly proper drinking together?

109
00:05:30,721 --> 00:05:32,863
At Barry's...

110
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:36,254
Barry had a party
about a year ago, was it?

111
00:05:36,256 --> 00:05:37,728
It's not that long,
it can't be that long ago.

112
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:40,542
It was a year and a half ago
or something.

113
00:05:40,544 --> 00:05:41,568
Down on that island?

114
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,103
Yeah, down the island.

115
00:05:43,105 --> 00:05:46,271
It was his fucking stag it was!

116
00:05:46,273 --> 00:05:47,744
I haven't thought about
that in so long, man.

117
00:05:47,746 --> 00:05:51,488
- We were on those banana boats and it was during the day...
- It was crazy.

118
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:54,079
...and we were drinking
because we hired a boat.

119
00:05:54,081 --> 00:05:56,927
All those little inflatable
things were cool as well.

120
00:05:56,929 --> 00:05:58,239
It didn't help being drunk

121
00:05:58,241 --> 00:06:01,567
and the fact it was daytime and
there were kids there as well

122
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:04,991
and we were running knocking
kids left, right and center!

123
00:06:04,993 --> 00:06:07,135
Ah, he's terrible.
He's so innocent though.

124
00:06:07,137 --> 00:06:08,737
That was a good boat trip.

125
00:06:15,521 --> 00:06:16,670
Is someone living up there?

126
00:06:16,672 --> 00:06:17,696
Not anymore!

127
00:06:19,778 --> 00:06:21,502
There are a couple of houses
around, aren't there?

128
00:06:21,504 --> 00:06:24,351
Yeah, but, well, I think, we
are kinda, the closest really.

129
00:06:24,353 --> 00:06:25,215
- Really?
- Yeah.

130
00:06:25,217 --> 00:06:27,070
Because it's up
near the old mines.

131
00:06:27,072 --> 00:06:29,472
Yeah, it's fairly, that, like...

132
00:06:29,474 --> 00:06:32,414
The only people that go up
there are kids messing about.

133
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:35,422
So does it open at night
or in the morning?

134
00:06:35,424 --> 00:06:37,342
What do you mean?
It's not an amusement park!

135
00:06:37,344 --> 00:06:39,072
It doesn't have opening hours!

136
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:43,071
Can we go overnight?
Can we go in the morning?

137
00:06:43,073 --> 00:06:44,770
Did you see the peak times?

138
00:06:46,465 --> 00:06:47,521
That'll be the lads.

139
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,598
Hi! Welcome!

140
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,879
Good to see you.

141
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,415
- You look great!
- So do you.

142
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:57,855
- Hi, Marissa, nice to see you.
- Hi, how are you?

143
00:06:57,857 --> 00:06:59,039
I'm so sorry we're late.

144
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,929
No, not at all,
you're grand.

145
00:07:03,201 --> 00:07:04,544
Will you come in
and shut the door!

146
00:07:04,546 --> 00:07:05,825
That stink
is getting everywhere!

147
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:12,638
- Hey.
- Hey.

148
00:07:16,322 --> 00:07:18,366
So what's with the smell?

149
00:07:18,368 --> 00:07:19,391
Oh, yeah.

150
00:07:19,393 --> 00:07:22,846
The devil farted and blew open
the gates of hell.

151
00:07:22,848 --> 00:07:26,559
No, it's a sinkhole up in the mountain.
It's all sulfur.

152
00:07:26,561 --> 00:07:29,504
A sinkhole? Those things
really freak me out.

153
00:07:29,506 --> 00:07:31,839
That's one thing I hate about
the countryside.

154
00:07:31,841 --> 00:07:35,422
All this talk about remote
working, it's bullshit.

155
00:07:35,424 --> 00:07:36,798
Reception here is brutal.

156
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,294
Stop being so rude, we're only
just in the door.

157
00:07:39,296 --> 00:07:41,151
I just need to check my
voicemail, I missed a call.

158
00:07:41,153 --> 00:07:43,230
The reception here
is really bad.

159
00:07:43,232 --> 00:07:45,374
It's part of the charm
of the place.

160
00:07:45,376 --> 00:07:48,766
It's one of the reasons
we come up here.

161
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:52,671
But if you really want it, if go
down to the end of the garden,

162
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:53,729
you'll get some there.

163
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:55,679
I'll be back in a minute.

164
00:07:55,681 --> 00:07:57,600
Jeez, can't you not stay off
the thing for five minutes?

165
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,718
We're only in the door.

166
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,767
I'll be quick honey.
I promise, okay?

167
00:08:00,769 --> 00:08:02,562
Just this last thing and
then we can start drinking.

168
00:08:05,057 --> 00:08:08,194
He's actually never off that thing.
He's like a teenager.

169
00:08:10,786 --> 00:08:12,322
Do you want coffee?
Wine? Beer?

170
00:08:13,121 --> 00:08:15,038
Coffee. Thanks.

171
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,912
Sorry we're late. I'm lucky I
got Ray out the door at all.

172
00:08:51,296 --> 00:08:52,961
I could stay here all day.

173
00:08:55,072 --> 00:08:56,322
It's a lovely getaway.

174
00:08:57,793 --> 00:08:59,136
And it smells nice in here.

175
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:00,226
Yeah.

176
00:09:01,697 --> 00:09:03,102
That's all.
I'm a trip adviser.

177
00:09:05,825 --> 00:09:07,841
That smell is rank.

178
00:09:09,888 --> 00:09:10,849
That's better.

179
00:09:12,449 --> 00:09:15,326
The church missed a trick
focusing on fire and brimstone.

180
00:09:15,328 --> 00:09:16,607
That smell is way worse.

181
00:09:16,609 --> 00:09:19,199
Use the toilet after a man loaded
up on Guinness and gherkins

182
00:09:19,201 --> 00:09:21,182
that'll be sure to make you
change your ways.

183
00:09:21,184 --> 00:09:23,167
There's no need
to bring that up again.

184
00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:24,674
There's never a bad
time to bring that up.

185
00:09:26,241 --> 00:09:29,951
So I guess there's no
outdoor activities this weekend.

186
00:09:29,953 --> 00:09:32,513
Is your modem on by the way?
I couldn't get a connection.

187
00:09:33,024 --> 00:09:34,304
There's no modem.

188
00:09:34,306 --> 00:09:35,550
There's no internet.

189
00:09:35,552 --> 00:09:38,048
That's the whole point
of this place.

190
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,425
Oh fuck, you're not serious?

191
00:09:40,225 --> 00:09:41,438
You said they have internet!

192
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,622
I said I'm sure they have.

193
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:45,026
I asked you to check! You
know I have to be connected!

194
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,039
Work has been a bit...

195
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:50,623
Can you not just stay off
that thing for one weekend?

196
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,031
We're here to have fun
with our friends!

197
00:09:52,033 --> 00:09:55,006
I'm sure they can get by in work
without you for a couple of days!

198
00:09:55,008 --> 00:09:57,022
Some of us have important work
to do, you know?

199
00:09:57,024 --> 00:10:00,447
We don't just sit around
all day writing articles.

200
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:01,985
Stop being such a cock.

201
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,079
You are such a cock!

202
00:10:21,824 --> 00:10:23,810
He's looking for matches!

203
00:10:28,449 --> 00:10:30,270
How far away is that thing?

204
00:10:30,272 --> 00:10:31,998
- What thing?
- The...

205
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,022
Oh, the hole!

206
00:10:33,024 --> 00:10:35,198
Um, it's about
two miles, I think.

207
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,704
It's on the side
of the mountain.

208
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:39,263
Is it dangerous?

209
00:10:39,265 --> 00:10:41,470
No, I don't think so.

210
00:10:41,472 --> 00:10:43,424
Otherwise, Pete would have
told us to get out.

211
00:10:44,832 --> 00:10:48,255
The chief superintendent is down
with him for the next few days

212
00:10:48,257 --> 00:10:51,618
helping him deal with the
press and the road blocks.

213
00:10:52,641 --> 00:10:54,526
Don't look so worried.

214
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,478
It's okay.
It's not that big at all.

215
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,782
They're just looking for
something to fill up the news.

216
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:00,769
Yeah, but what about
the fumes...

217
00:11:02,049 --> 00:11:04,801
The fumes... No worse
than the fumes in the city.

218
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:06,849
I suppose.

219
00:11:08,928 --> 00:11:10,400
Anyone fancy a smoke?

220
00:11:11,233 --> 00:11:12,831
Nice one.

221
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,559
But we'll have
to smoke it outside.

222
00:11:14,561 --> 00:11:16,031
For fuck's sake!

223
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:17,119
House rules.

224
00:11:17,121 --> 00:11:18,879
It's your fucking house!

225
00:11:18,881 --> 00:11:21,439
It's Marissa's father's place,
and come on,

226
00:11:21,441 --> 00:11:22,722
he doesn't want
smoking in here.

227
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,321
Let's go.

228
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:41,889
I might make a quick call.

229
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:45,729
For fuck's sake.

230
00:11:53,984 --> 00:11:55,327
Aww.

231
00:11:55,329 --> 00:11:57,855
They're splashing him with water
constantly, and then he goes,

232
00:11:57,857 --> 00:12:01,791
"Mr Fungi?" And he's there
dead on the ground.

233
00:12:01,793 --> 00:12:05,407
Did they not have the animal rights
people coming down about that?

234
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:06,846
- About fungi?
- Yeah.

235
00:12:06,848 --> 00:12:09,918
He was like, "Can I get
a smoke there please?"

236
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,734
I mean, those guys, they
watch him like a hawk.

237
00:12:12,736 --> 00:12:15,198
This is a cartoon fungi,
it's not real fungi!

238
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,958
Yeah, it's not, like, real.

239
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,494
- Oh.
- What?

240
00:12:18,496 --> 00:12:20,609
- Real fungi was gonna...
- Yeah, yeah. Sorry, yeah.

241
00:12:21,953 --> 00:12:23,454
I knew that.
I knew that.

242
00:12:23,456 --> 00:12:25,119
I didn't know you smoked.

243
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:26,399
- I don't.
- Oh.

244
00:12:26,401 --> 00:12:27,361
- No, I don't.
- You don't.

245
00:12:31,872 --> 00:12:32,894
Are you okay?

246
00:12:32,896 --> 00:12:34,014
Yeah, fine.

247
00:12:34,016 --> 00:12:35,070
Are you sure?

248
00:12:35,072 --> 00:12:36,095
Yeah, I'm fine.

249
00:12:36,097 --> 00:12:37,214
Did you have enough to eat?

250
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:39,870
I did, yeah.
It was lovely, thank you.

251
00:12:39,872 --> 00:12:42,943
You're very welcome.
Did you like my lasagna?

252
00:12:42,945 --> 00:12:43,967
I loved it.

253
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:48,672
Working hard in the kitchen.
Go all day flat.

254
00:12:49,664 --> 00:12:51,103
It was lovely.

255
00:12:51,105 --> 00:12:52,450
I haven't ever had one before.

256
00:12:53,344 --> 00:12:55,903
You're really quiet today.

257
00:12:55,905 --> 00:12:57,726
I'm fine. I'm just tired.

258
00:12:57,728 --> 00:12:59,039
Over the last few weeks,
you know?

259
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,738
I haven't been getting
great sleep and stuff.

260
00:13:01,633 --> 00:13:02,783
Are you sure that's all?

261
00:13:02,785 --> 00:13:04,734
Yeah. That's it.

262
00:13:04,736 --> 00:13:06,078
What else would it be?

263
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,318
Well, come on, I mean,
you've been through a lot.

264
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,886
- Yeah.
- You know?

265
00:13:09,888 --> 00:13:11,679
It's just a bit, you know,

266
00:13:11,681 --> 00:13:14,750
first time being around
you all again without her.

267
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,098
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

268
00:13:19,168 --> 00:13:21,182
Right, that's it. I can't
handle that smell anymore.

269
00:13:21,184 --> 00:13:22,784
It's giving me a headache.
I'm going in.

270
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:29,150
Where are you going?

271
00:13:29,152 --> 00:13:31,745
I'm just checking
if Ray is still out here.

272
00:13:32,448 --> 00:13:33,409
Do you want a knife?

273
00:13:33,793 --> 00:13:34,752
I have one.

274
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,073
Ray?

275
00:13:48,225 --> 00:13:49,185
Ray?

276
00:14:12,225 --> 00:14:13,790
You're so jumpy!

277
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:15,007
Ray's in the house.

278
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:16,033
Okay.

279
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,254
If you're really good and you go to
heaven, does that mean the gambling...

280
00:14:28,256 --> 00:14:29,567
Where's the gambling
and booze?

281
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:32,350
Is it in heaven
for being good?

282
00:14:32,352 --> 00:14:34,815
Or is it in hell
for just kind of...

283
00:14:34,817 --> 00:14:36,253
Well, that's where
we all are.

284
00:14:36,255 --> 00:14:38,270
Maybe hell
is everyone's worst nightmare.

285
00:14:38,272 --> 00:14:42,785
Individually. Whatever your
worst nightmare is.

286
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,608
Then you would be...

287
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,813
If your worst,
worst nightmare was spiders

288
00:14:46,815 --> 00:14:50,110
then your hell would be in a
room full of spiders forever.

289
00:14:50,112 --> 00:14:51,967
I'm so scared of
strippers and booze.

290
00:14:55,424 --> 00:14:58,270
Your last
dying thought is like,

291
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:02,942
"My worst fear is I just
absolutely hate sun holidays!"

292
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:06,782
That is in some short story,
that that is what hell is

293
00:15:06,784 --> 00:15:09,695
your worst nightmare.
That it is a personal thing.

294
00:15:09,697 --> 00:15:13,790
If we led a really bad life

295
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:17,022
but at the very last moment...

296
00:15:17,024 --> 00:15:18,397
You become an organ
donor or something.

297
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,030
Yeah, can you redeem yourself
that way?

298
00:15:22,368 --> 00:15:25,054
That's Pascal's wager.

299
00:15:25,056 --> 00:15:27,550
You can just be crap
for your whole life

300
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,504
which I plan on kinda doing.

301
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,622
Would it work
the other way then?

302
00:15:34,624 --> 00:15:37,310
If you were really good,
like, were really,

303
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:39,135
um, didn't do anything bad

304
00:15:39,137 --> 00:15:42,558
and then at the last moment
you did something awful...

305
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,582
Shot a baby!

306
00:15:43,584 --> 00:15:44,894
- Yeah.
- Oh.

307
00:15:46,816 --> 00:15:49,726
Would all your good stuff
then be, like, forgotten?

308
00:15:49,728 --> 00:15:50,753
No, I don't think so.

309
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,430
They'd weigh it up!

310
00:15:54,432 --> 00:15:56,638
What's the symbol
for the judicial system?

311
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,206
You know, the scales.

312
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:01,119
Yeah, it's that with, uh,
St. Peter with...

313
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,974
I don't know if it's the food
or the smoke or what

314
00:16:10,976 --> 00:16:13,086
but I am really tired.

315
00:16:13,088 --> 00:16:14,750
I'm going to have to go to bed.

316
00:16:14,752 --> 00:16:17,377
You shouldn't be smoking.
You know how you get.

317
00:16:18,753 --> 00:16:20,001
Why, how do I get?

318
00:16:20,608 --> 00:16:21,729
Like that.

319
00:16:54,303 --> 00:16:56,705
Do you know what would really
liven this place up?

320
00:16:57,473 --> 00:16:58,626
Strip poker.

321
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:04,030
No way I'm getting
my kit off in front of you.

322
00:17:04,032 --> 00:17:06,016
It's not you I want to see
with your kit off.

323
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:07,618
Oh, yeah?

324
00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:09,727
In your dreams.

325
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:13,214
Eye's off my wife,
you pervert.

326
00:17:13,216 --> 00:17:15,105
Don't worry. I only have eyes
for this beauty here.

327
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:17,472
Oh. Get a room. Jesus.

328
00:17:19,937 --> 00:17:21,374
I'm going to hit the hay.

329
00:17:21,376 --> 00:17:23,201
But, Ger, it's only one!

330
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,302
I'm wrecked.

331
00:17:26,304 --> 00:17:28,639
I'm not used to
social drinking.

332
00:17:28,641 --> 00:17:31,266
You mean, you
normally drink on your own?

333
00:17:31,872 --> 00:17:34,366
I'm only messing!

334
00:17:34,368 --> 00:17:36,481
Well, I'm going to go as well.
I'm wrecked.

335
00:17:38,144 --> 00:17:39,391
- Night.
- Night.

336
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:41,983
Ooh! Leaving together!

337
00:17:41,985 --> 00:17:43,071
Lucy and Gerny!

338
00:17:43,073 --> 00:17:44,477
Have a nice journey.

339
00:17:44,479 --> 00:17:47,678
We're going to get all hot and
steamy together, aren't we, Ger?

340
00:17:49,696 --> 00:17:51,070
Goodnight.

341
00:17:51,072 --> 00:17:52,479
And enjoy.
See you later.

342
00:18:01,536 --> 00:18:02,656
Oh, hey.

343
00:18:04,127 --> 00:18:07,358
Marissa told me about Barbara.

344
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,647
I'm really sorry, I thought
you guys were great together.

345
00:18:11,649 --> 00:18:14,113
I don't know.
It just wasn't meant to be.

346
00:18:17,952 --> 00:18:21,920
Do you think we end up with the
person we're meant to end up with?

347
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,368
I like to think so.

348
00:18:27,136 --> 00:18:28,097
Yeah.

349
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:29,536
Me too.

350
00:18:30,529 --> 00:18:32,033
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

351
00:18:40,224 --> 00:18:41,920
For fuck's sake.

352
00:19:41,216 --> 00:19:43,905
And here I thought you guys came
out here to get away from it all.

353
00:19:45,152 --> 00:19:47,006
Should we give Pete a shout?

354
00:19:47,008 --> 00:19:48,286
What good would that do?

355
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:50,176
They're not local squad cars.

356
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:52,768
I hate that sound.

357
00:19:53,089 --> 00:19:54,911
Me too.

358
00:19:54,913 --> 00:19:56,833
Well, it wouldn't be much use
if you liked it.

359
00:19:57,952 --> 00:19:59,742
In all the years
we've been coming here,

360
00:19:59,744 --> 00:20:01,598
I don't think
I've ever heard sirens.

361
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,681
But in all those years there's
never been a sinkhole.

362
00:20:08,449 --> 00:20:11,969
What is a sinkhole anyway?
It just opens up...

363
00:20:12,992 --> 00:20:15,101
Yeah, I think.
I don't know.

364
00:20:15,103 --> 00:20:17,565
The landfill or something?
Does it...

365
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:21,342
There's nothing under it and no one
noticed until someone stepped on it?

366
00:20:21,344 --> 00:20:22,399
How deep is it?

367
00:20:22,401 --> 00:20:23,741
That's what I was wondering,

368
00:20:23,743 --> 00:20:28,158
because if it is some sort of
chemical reaction...

369
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,533
Seeing as I'm not gonna be
able to get any work done,

370
00:20:29,535 --> 00:20:30,848
I might as well
do some damage.

371
00:20:31,872 --> 00:20:32,989
Who's joining me?

372
00:20:32,991 --> 00:20:34,014
That's my cue.

373
00:20:34,016 --> 00:20:35,038
Mine too.

374
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,318
Jesus.

375
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,145
Your wife goes
so you have to go as well?

376
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,589
Don't forget, we've to do
this again tomorrow.

377
00:20:42,591 --> 00:20:45,661
I thought this was a party! Marissa,
will you please, please just...

378
00:20:45,663 --> 00:20:47,645
give your husband permission
to stay up for a few more?

379
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:50,174
He can do what he likes.
He speaks for himself.

380
00:20:50,176 --> 00:20:51,137
I'm wrecked, man.

381
00:20:52,191 --> 00:20:53,535
You're a lightweight.

382
00:20:53,537 --> 00:20:56,095
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You haven't
been drinking as long as I have.

383
00:20:56,097 --> 00:20:59,134
You got to live for today.
Tomorrow might never come.

384
00:20:59,136 --> 00:21:01,536
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Good night, Mr. Brooks.

385
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:04,545
At least you two
are still up for it.

386
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:13,246
Thank you very much,
Mr. Brooks.

387
00:21:13,248 --> 00:21:14,273
Cheers!

388
00:21:17,281 --> 00:21:18,433
That's much better.

389
00:21:23,711 --> 00:21:25,342
Ooh.

390
00:21:25,344 --> 00:21:26,976
- Our little friend here.
- Nice.

391
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,325
I think you're in
the doghouse.

392
00:22:03,327 --> 00:22:05,152
Nah. She's always like that.

393
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,039
Yeah, blame her.

394
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:08,799
Mmm-mmm.

395
00:22:08,801 --> 00:22:11,357
She likes to sit around
doing nothing.

396
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:12,768
I can't do that.

397
00:23:29,152 --> 00:23:31,552
I think we should go up
to the stinkhole tomorrow, eh?

398
00:23:32,415 --> 00:23:33,695
I'm not going up there.

399
00:23:33,697 --> 00:23:35,549
Why not? I mean,

400
00:23:35,551 --> 00:23:37,405
when's the next time you're
gonna see something like this?

401
00:23:37,407 --> 00:23:38,430
It could be
once in a lifetime.

402
00:23:38,432 --> 00:23:41,217
I don't I ever need to see
something like that.

403
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,286
Hurry up with that joint,
will you?

404
00:23:44,288 --> 00:23:46,301
The stink is starting
to get to me.

405
00:23:46,303 --> 00:23:47,710
I'm kinda getting used to it.

406
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,705
Fuck off.

407
00:23:49,983 --> 00:23:51,488
No, he's right.
Kill that thing.

408
00:23:53,761 --> 00:23:55,871
Anyway,
I want to go to bed.

409
00:23:55,873 --> 00:23:58,465
All right, lads.
This is getting awkward.

410
00:23:59,808 --> 00:24:01,089
It doesn't have to be.

411
00:25:33,472 --> 00:25:34,559
Baby?

412
00:25:34,561 --> 00:25:35,582
Baby, wake up!

413
00:25:35,584 --> 00:25:36,705
Yeah.

414
00:25:37,344 --> 00:25:38,685
Listen,

415
00:25:38,687 --> 00:25:42,462
I think Ray is sleeping
with Emma and Shane.

416
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:44,797
Good one.

417
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,365
No, no, no.
I'm not joking.

418
00:25:46,367 --> 00:25:48,157
I saw him
going into their room.

419
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:49,728
Yeah. I'm tired.

420
00:25:50,977 --> 00:25:53,469
Listen, I listened
at the door.

421
00:25:53,471 --> 00:25:54,911
They were having sex.

422
00:25:59,455 --> 00:26:01,277
They probably...

423
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:06,045
They probably saw you and
wanted to wind you up.

424
00:26:06,047 --> 00:26:07,105
No, they didn't see me.

425
00:26:09,152 --> 00:26:11,069
Of course, they saw you.

426
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:14,205
It's just like something
Shane and Emma would do.

427
00:26:14,207 --> 00:26:16,478
No, I'm sure
they didn't see me.

428
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,921
They saw you.
They saw you.

429
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:21,921
I'm going down again.

430
00:26:22,496 --> 00:26:23,614
Oh...

431
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,501
- Don't be crazy. Come on.
- No, no, no.

432
00:26:25,503 --> 00:26:27,169
It's not crazy.
Okay?

433
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,526
Emma...
She's always been wild.

434
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:33,118
In college, she was always
getting up to things.

435
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,030
We all did
crazy things in college.

436
00:26:36,032 --> 00:26:38,237
Yeah,
but that's normal crazy.

437
00:26:38,239 --> 00:26:41,661
I'm talking about, like,
getting drunk crazy,

438
00:26:41,663 --> 00:26:42,974
jumping into a fountain crazy.

439
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:45,312
Emma pushes things.
I know her.

440
00:26:47,456 --> 00:26:48,797
I know her.

441
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,621
Whoa! Come back to bed.
Come on.

442
00:26:50,623 --> 00:26:51,678
No. No.

443
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,057
I'm going to make sure, okay?

444
00:26:53,951 --> 00:26:56,125
Look, this is ridiculous.

445
00:26:56,127 --> 00:26:57,757
They're just messing with you.

446
00:26:57,759 --> 00:26:58,974
But then I'll ask her.

447
00:26:58,976 --> 00:27:01,504
- Now?
- No! Not now! In the morning.

448
00:27:02,656 --> 00:27:04,031
I can see tomorrow's
going to be fun.

449
00:27:11,424 --> 00:27:12,574
Do you think she'll tell you?

450
00:27:12,576 --> 00:27:13,790
No.

451
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,009
But I'll know.

452
00:30:05,311 --> 00:30:06,495
Is anyone out there?

453
00:30:08,767 --> 00:30:09,950
Jason!

454
00:30:09,952 --> 00:30:11,135
Are you all right?

455
00:30:12,672 --> 00:30:13,920
Jason, are you okay, man?

456
00:30:16,927 --> 00:30:18,110
Jason, you need
to come inside.

457
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:20,513
It's freezing out here.
And it stinks.

458
00:30:22,752 --> 00:30:24,161
You must be pretty
fucking drunk, man...

459
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:09,280
What did we do?

460
00:31:10,752 --> 00:31:12,318
You don't remember?

461
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,432
I remember we said
never with friends.

462
00:31:16,384 --> 00:31:18,622
I need a coffee.
Do you want one?

463
00:31:18,624 --> 00:31:20,289
No, I don't want a coffee.

464
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,080
Shit!

465
00:31:23,328 --> 00:31:25,790
How are we going
to face them now?

466
00:31:25,792 --> 00:31:27,678
The same way
we always face them.

467
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,769
They don't know anything.

468
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,477
What about Ray?

469
00:31:32,479 --> 00:31:33,920
He's not going
to say anything.

470
00:31:34,496 --> 00:31:36,161
Oh, fuck!

471
00:31:42,528 --> 00:31:45,246
Don't worry. Okay?

472
00:31:45,248 --> 00:31:46,913
Just forget about it.

473
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:50,720
We'll pretend
it didn't happen.

474
00:32:01,631 --> 00:32:03,516
Oh. I'm so sorry.
Did I wake you?

475
00:32:03,518 --> 00:32:05,054
No. I'm...

476
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:06,304
Did you see Ray?

477
00:32:06,943 --> 00:32:08,829
Um... No.

478
00:32:08,831 --> 00:32:09,917
Is he not with you?

479
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,292
No.

480
00:32:11,294 --> 00:32:13,248
I don't think he came
to bed last night.

481
00:32:13,951 --> 00:32:15,870
- Really?
- Hmm.

482
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,629
Well, actually
I can't be too sure.

483
00:32:17,631 --> 00:32:19,808
That bed is so comfy,
I slept like a corpse.

484
00:32:25,439 --> 00:32:27,582
I thought he might have
fallen asleep out there.

485
00:32:27,584 --> 00:32:28,992
Wouldn't be the first time.

486
00:32:29,632 --> 00:32:31,777
I mean, once he gets drunk.

487
00:32:35,231 --> 00:32:38,045
Jesus! That stink's gotten
way worse today.

488
00:32:38,047 --> 00:32:39,677
Yeah, I know.
Just shut the door.

489
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:40,703
Oh!

490
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,041
- Morning.
- Where's Ray?

491
00:32:44,991 --> 00:32:46,877
How would I know?

492
00:32:46,879 --> 00:32:47,965
He's not with you now, is he?

493
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:50,720
No. Was he still up when you
went to bed last night?

494
00:32:51,423 --> 00:32:52,865
Yeah, he was.

495
00:32:55,103 --> 00:32:56,800
And you were
the last to go to bed?

496
00:32:57,215 --> 00:32:58,878
Uh, yep.

497
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,182
Where the fuck is he then?

498
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:03,645
I don't know. Maybe
he's outside on his phone?

499
00:33:03,647 --> 00:33:06,686
Believe me that's
the first place that I looked.

500
00:33:06,688 --> 00:33:09,565
Was he still drinking
when you went to bed?

501
00:33:09,567 --> 00:33:12,285
Yeah, I suppose. I mean, he
wanted to stay up, you know?

502
00:33:12,287 --> 00:33:13,313
You know how he is.

503
00:33:18,495 --> 00:33:20,097
Is your car outside?

504
00:33:30,879 --> 00:33:32,608
You fucking prick.

505
00:33:50,976 --> 00:33:51,936
What is it?

506
00:33:52,576 --> 00:33:53,537
Work.

507
00:33:54,464 --> 00:33:55,550
It's always work.

508
00:33:55,552 --> 00:33:57,660
He can't leave it alone
just for a couple of days.

509
00:33:57,662 --> 00:34:00,830
Oh, I'm so sorry, hon.
Come here.

510
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,592
He's just a fucking prick!

511
00:34:04,991 --> 00:34:07,520
Well, I knew what he was like
when I married him.

512
00:34:10,688 --> 00:34:11,904
I hope that's full of tea.

513
00:34:12,959 --> 00:34:13,920
Excellent.

514
00:34:15,999 --> 00:34:16,960
Are you okay?

515
00:34:17,888 --> 00:34:18,849
Ray left.

516
00:34:22,207 --> 00:34:24,671
For work. Sorry.
He left for work

517
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,742
It doesn't matter.

518
00:34:27,744 --> 00:34:30,526
I'm really glad that I'm here
with all of you.

519
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,125
Ray can go do what he likes.

520
00:34:32,127 --> 00:34:33,823
I'm going to enjoy myself.

521
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:39,200
Breakfast is here.

522
00:34:40,095 --> 00:34:41,405
All right!

523
00:34:41,407 --> 00:34:42,750
Perfect timing.

524
00:34:42,752 --> 00:34:44,225
I'm fucking starving.
What did you get, man?

525
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,414
Which is the one
where Roger Moore

526
00:34:48,416 --> 00:34:50,045
is skiing and then he jumps off

527
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:52,253
with the Union Jack parachute?

528
00:34:52,255 --> 00:34:53,376
Will I give you a hand?

529
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:55,360
No, I'm fine.

530
00:34:58,208 --> 00:34:59,648
Anyone up for a walk?

531
00:35:00,254 --> 00:35:01,501
Are you joking?

532
00:35:01,503 --> 00:35:04,832
I don't want to ruin breakfast
with lungs full of stinky air.

533
00:35:06,495 --> 00:35:08,796
Come on.
It's not that bad.

534
00:35:08,798 --> 00:35:10,781
You'll get used to it.
It's lovely outside.

535
00:35:10,783 --> 00:35:12,796
Maybe if you're
wearing a gas mask.

536
00:35:12,798 --> 00:35:15,392
I think the smell has gotten
much worse today.

537
00:35:16,543 --> 00:35:17,503
Anyone?

538
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:19,328
No way.

539
00:35:21,438 --> 00:35:22,399
Not me.

540
00:35:23,198 --> 00:35:24,544
I've too much to do.

541
00:35:27,135 --> 00:35:29,565
Well, I don't know how you can stay
inside all day, even with the smell.

542
00:35:29,567 --> 00:35:30,877
We should go for a drive!

543
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:33,405
We could go down
to the sea or something!

544
00:35:33,407 --> 00:35:36,221
Sorry to report that
the stink is everywhere.

545
00:35:36,223 --> 00:35:38,301
It's even worse
down in the village.

546
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:42,140
And we can't go to the sea.
The roads are closed.

547
00:35:42,142 --> 00:35:44,448
Well, we'll just have to make
the most of being here.

548
00:35:45,438 --> 00:35:46,399
Won't we?

549
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,277
Well, I'm going
to walk off that breakfast.

550
00:35:57,279 --> 00:35:58,750
I'll see you lot later.

551
00:35:58,752 --> 00:35:59,837
- Bye.
- Enjoy.

552
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,088
Good luck.

553
00:36:35,424 --> 00:36:38,653
- It's so toasty here.
- It is.

554
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:41,469
Look at me, I'm all sleepy even
though I slept so well last night.

555
00:36:41,471 --> 00:36:42,368
- Did you?
- Really did.

556
00:36:44,479 --> 00:36:46,334
Did you see him when you
got up this morning?

557
00:36:46,336 --> 00:36:48,221
Who? Ray?

558
00:36:48,223 --> 00:36:49,247
- Mm.
- No.

559
00:36:50,302 --> 00:36:51,645
Was his car there?

560
00:36:51,647 --> 00:36:54,590
Um, I think so, yeah,

561
00:36:54,592 --> 00:36:57,020
but I was tired,
so I'm not sure.

562
00:36:57,022 --> 00:36:59,326
Do you think he spent
the whole night with them?

563
00:36:59,328 --> 00:37:01,023
Oh, come on. I don't
want to think about that.

564
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,508
When are you
going to ask Shane?

565
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,781
What? I'm not
asking Shane anything.

566
00:37:06,783 --> 00:37:08,444
You said you'd ask Emma!

567
00:37:08,446 --> 00:37:11,388
And anyway, I still think
they were messing with you.

568
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,796
No, I know what they did.

569
00:37:12,798 --> 00:37:16,029
Well, you spent long enough
out there listening to them.

570
00:37:16,031 --> 00:37:17,084
I needed to be sure!

571
00:37:17,086 --> 00:37:20,063
And how did listening at
their door for an hour help?

572
00:37:21,023 --> 00:37:22,270
It wasn't an hour.

573
00:37:22,272 --> 00:37:23,648
It was only a few minutes.

574
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:28,957
Anyway, I think
Ray is feeling guilty

575
00:37:28,959 --> 00:37:31,645
because he can't even
face us this morning.

576
00:37:31,647 --> 00:37:33,917
You saw the note.
He had work.

577
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:34,876
Work.

578
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:36,636
Anyway, look,
it's none of our business.

579
00:37:36,638 --> 00:37:38,081
None of our business!

580
00:37:40,382 --> 00:37:41,343
Carry on.

581
00:37:42,398 --> 00:37:43,840
Nothing to see here.

582
00:37:44,799 --> 00:37:46,301
Look, you finish up there.

583
00:37:46,303 --> 00:37:48,189
I'm tired.
I'm going to lie down.

584
00:37:48,191 --> 00:37:49,280
All right.

585
00:39:41,662 --> 00:39:43,359
Isn't it a bit early for that?

586
00:39:47,391 --> 00:39:49,664
It's never too early
for wine and cheese.

587
00:39:51,903 --> 00:39:52,989
- There you go.
- Thanks.

588
00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:54,016
Do I cut?

589
00:40:05,471 --> 00:40:07,231
This weekend was a big mistake.

590
00:40:07,999 --> 00:40:09,756
No, it wasn't.

591
00:40:09,758 --> 00:40:11,165
We've been planning this
for ages.

592
00:40:11,167 --> 00:40:12,606
Yeah.

593
00:40:12,608 --> 00:40:15,773
I didn't expect it
to turn out like this.

594
00:40:15,775 --> 00:40:19,039
Look, we're all here now so
let's just make the most of it.

595
00:40:19,615 --> 00:40:20,704
Yeah.

596
00:40:30,879 --> 00:40:32,000
Take your clothes off.

597
00:41:32,799 --> 00:41:34,268
You're starting early.

598
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:37,213
There's not much else
to do in here.

599
00:41:37,215 --> 00:41:38,560
I'm sure you could
think of something.

600
00:41:39,583 --> 00:41:40,960
What's that supposed to mean?

601
00:41:42,175 --> 00:41:43,136
Um...

602
00:41:45,054 --> 00:41:47,007
You don't even have
a fucking TV.

603
00:41:47,775 --> 00:41:48,829
Marissa's parents...

604
00:41:48,831 --> 00:41:50,976
I know, I know. Relaxing
getaway and all that.

605
00:41:51,903 --> 00:41:52,991
Are you going to join me?

606
00:41:53,951 --> 00:41:54,911
Yeah.

607
00:41:58,687 --> 00:42:01,564
- He does work really hard.
- Mm-hmm.

608
00:42:01,566 --> 00:42:02,685
Like, he's got...

609
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:06,012
He just really has
a work ethic.

610
00:42:06,014 --> 00:42:09,789
I just wish that he could switch
it off from time to time.

611
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,677
Yeah, but if he's ambitious,
you know...

612
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:13,021
Yeah.

613
00:42:13,023 --> 00:42:16,669
And it is one of the things
that I love about him.

614
00:42:16,671 --> 00:42:18,557
It's one of the things
I hate about him, too.

615
00:42:20,351 --> 00:42:23,804
He's just always
focused on work,

616
00:42:23,806 --> 00:42:27,069
even if, you know, we have
things planned for the evening,

617
00:42:27,071 --> 00:42:28,348
or just a night
in front of the telly,

618
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:30,556
he'll always take
the laptop out

619
00:42:30,558 --> 00:42:33,277
and just finds it hard
to switch off.

620
00:42:33,279 --> 00:42:34,752
Have you said it to him?

621
00:42:36,255 --> 00:42:37,276
I think he knows.

622
00:42:37,278 --> 00:42:38,752
- Oh. Thank you.
- Thank you.

623
00:42:39,134 --> 00:42:40,508
But, um,

624
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:42,045
I don't want to seem...

625
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:44,445
I know work is really
important to him... Thanks.

626
00:42:44,447 --> 00:42:46,844
You don't want to seem
like you're nagging.

627
00:42:46,846 --> 00:42:48,156
Yeah, exactly.

628
00:42:48,158 --> 00:42:49,375
I think you should
just say it to him.

629
00:42:53,375 --> 00:42:54,941
You should say it
to him because...

630
00:42:54,943 --> 00:42:56,861
That's... Thanks. Jesus.
That's grand, thanks.

631
00:42:56,863 --> 00:42:58,943
Come on, Emma.
You can handle it.

632
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,636
Maybe organize
a holiday or something.

633
00:43:04,638 --> 00:43:07,389
It's really hard for him
to get time off work.

634
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:10,206
It always used to bother me more
than him that he's working.

635
00:43:10,208 --> 00:43:11,677
Mmm-hmm.

636
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:13,216
- Who, Ray?
- Yeah.

637
00:43:14,335 --> 00:43:16,540
Just constantly...

638
00:43:16,542 --> 00:43:18,590
I mean,
he really does work hard.

639
00:43:18,592 --> 00:43:20,320
He takes it very seriously.
But he's just...

640
00:43:22,847 --> 00:43:24,191
Be back in two seconds.
Sorry.

641
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:56,060
I'd love to just ask him just to
get away for a proper holiday.

642
00:43:56,062 --> 00:43:57,469
Ladies.

643
00:43:57,471 --> 00:44:00,348
Shh, we can't talk
about them anymore!

644
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:01,596
Yeah, yeah.

645
00:44:01,598 --> 00:44:03,996
Say no more now.

646
00:44:03,998 --> 00:44:05,597
Don't worry,
I'm used to that.

647
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,093
Really?

648
00:44:08,095 --> 00:44:09,855
Yeah, he's used to everyone
talking about him.

649
00:44:11,103 --> 00:44:12,092
Yeah, he wish.

650
00:44:12,094 --> 00:44:14,301
I'm just gonna go out
and make a quick call.

651
00:44:14,303 --> 00:44:15,519
I'll just try Ray again.

652
00:44:16,799 --> 00:44:18,141
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

653
00:44:18,143 --> 00:44:19,647
I'll just give him
another try.

654
00:45:48,767 --> 00:45:50,560
There'd be no silence
if there was a TV.

655
00:45:51,903 --> 00:45:53,596
There'd be no talking either.

656
00:45:53,598 --> 00:45:54,784
So much different to now, so.

657
00:45:58,303 --> 00:46:00,063
Look, I'll let you in
on a little secret.

658
00:46:01,311 --> 00:46:02,336
There is a TV.

659
00:46:02,623 --> 00:46:03,708
What?

660
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:04,957
Marissa hid it away.

661
00:46:04,959 --> 00:46:07,743
The reception is bad, and it
only has the Irish channels.

662
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:09,917
We could watch a movie!

663
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:11,615
I have to just plug
my usb key in.

664
00:46:13,822 --> 00:46:15,069
I'll say it to Marissa later.

665
00:46:15,071 --> 00:46:16,765
Yeah.

666
00:46:16,767 --> 00:46:18,525
What's up with Marissa anyway?

667
00:46:18,527 --> 00:46:19,679
She's been acting weird
all morning.

668
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:21,949
Well...

669
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,455
Babes, I need you
in the bedroom, yeah?

670
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:27,359
Right. Always in demand.

671
00:46:34,815 --> 00:46:36,764
<i>Hey! You've reached Ray.</i>

672
00:46:36,766 --> 00:46:37,949
<i>Please leave your
name and number</i>

673
00:46:37,951 --> 00:46:39,711
<i>and I'll call you back as
soon as possible. Thank you.</i>

674
00:46:41,694 --> 00:46:43,068
Will you answer your phone?

675
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:44,928
You'd answer the fucking thing
if it was work!

676
00:46:50,175 --> 00:46:51,260
You're serious?

677
00:46:51,262 --> 00:46:52,508
Yes.

678
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:53,531
Fuck sake.

679
00:46:53,533 --> 00:46:54,876
We fucked up.

680
00:46:54,878 --> 00:46:56,829
Who fucking leaves
messages on mirrors?

681
00:46:56,831 --> 00:46:59,421
We really fucked up.
What were we thinking?

682
00:46:59,423 --> 00:47:00,861
I'm going to talk
to them fuckers.

683
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:03,037
No, no, no, you can't, because you
don't know for sure who wrote it.

684
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:04,060
Yes, I do.

685
00:47:04,062 --> 00:47:05,021
No, you don't.

686
00:47:05,023 --> 00:47:06,909
Yes, she's been
acting weird all morning.

687
00:47:06,911 --> 00:47:08,256
It could have been Jason.

688
00:47:08,831 --> 00:47:09,757
I don't know.

689
00:47:09,759 --> 00:47:11,741
Well, yeah, because
if she knows he knows.

690
00:47:11,743 --> 00:47:12,704
Fuck!

691
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,332
What are you doing?

692
00:47:18,334 --> 00:47:20,124
What does it
look like I'm doing?

693
00:47:20,126 --> 00:47:21,244
Look, we can't...

694
00:47:21,246 --> 00:47:23,007
We can't leave, all right?
They're our friends.

695
00:47:24,253 --> 00:47:27,004
We can't just run away.

696
00:47:27,006 --> 00:47:28,959
Come on, just get
your stuff together.

697
00:47:30,142 --> 00:47:31,038
Where are you going?

698
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,895
I'm going out
for a think, all right?

699
00:47:44,798 --> 00:47:45,821
Jesus Christ!

700
00:47:45,823 --> 00:47:46,783
Dude, relax, will you?

701
00:47:53,566 --> 00:47:54,847
Was that you? The growling?

702
00:47:57,407 --> 00:47:59,229
Have you been
following me all along?

703
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:00,541
Jesus.

704
00:48:00,543 --> 00:48:03,229
I've better things to do with
my time than follow you around.

705
00:48:03,231 --> 00:48:05,372
What are you doing
all the way out here, then?

706
00:48:05,374 --> 00:48:06,909
All the way out here?

707
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,902
Are you all right?

708
00:48:10,974 --> 00:48:13,054
Just show me the way back to the
house, will you? I can't find it.

709
00:48:13,855 --> 00:48:15,868
Have you been smoking grass?

710
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:17,439
The house is right over there.

711
00:48:22,335 --> 00:48:24,127
Is this where you've been
for the last few hours?

712
00:48:25,439 --> 00:48:26,399
Hours?

713
00:48:28,158 --> 00:48:31,228
Have you been eating mushrooms
or something? I mean, you know,

714
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:32,540
because if you have...

715
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:34,400
Have you been feeling weird
at all since you got here?

716
00:48:35,775 --> 00:48:37,600
Look, nothing's been normal
since we got here.

717
00:48:38,814 --> 00:48:40,476
I mean like, your head?

718
00:48:40,478 --> 00:48:41,501
Headaches?

719
00:48:41,503 --> 00:48:42,685
No.

720
00:48:42,687 --> 00:48:44,316
What are you talking about?

721
00:48:44,318 --> 00:48:45,851
I think there's something
in the air.

722
00:48:45,853 --> 00:48:47,199
You got that right.

723
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:51,036
We should go back inside.

724
00:48:51,038 --> 00:48:52,637
Yeah, go ahead.
I'll follow you back.

725
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:54,013
You should come with me.

726
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:56,411
There's something wrong
out here.

727
00:48:56,413 --> 00:49:00,061
It's not just the smell.
There's something in the air.

728
00:49:00,063 --> 00:49:01,660
That's bullshit, all right?

729
00:49:01,662 --> 00:49:03,484
I got lost and I'm
right beside the house.

730
00:49:03,486 --> 00:49:04,603
If you stay out here
on your own,

731
00:49:04,605 --> 00:49:05,948
something's gonna
happen to you.

732
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:08,636
Fuck off. Look, the house
is right fucking there!

733
00:49:08,638 --> 00:49:09,599
Not always.

734
00:49:15,647 --> 00:49:16,896
Do you hear that?

735
00:49:17,533 --> 00:49:18,621
What?

736
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:19,776
Listen.

737
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:24,733
Oh, come on...

738
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:29,436
Shit.

739
00:49:42,974 --> 00:49:44,128
Lads, what was that?

740
00:49:46,046 --> 00:49:47,899
Did you see
anything out there?

741
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:49,661
They said the sinkhole would
likely get bigger.

742
00:49:49,663 --> 00:49:51,548
You need to ring Pete.

743
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:53,596
Sounds like the gates of hell
just got blown wide open.

744
00:49:53,598 --> 00:49:54,619
Don't say that.

745
00:49:54,621 --> 00:49:55,709
I think we should leave.

746
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,828
We should definitely
stay inside.

747
00:49:56,830 --> 00:49:58,716
There's no need to panic.

748
00:49:58,718 --> 00:50:00,731
I'll ring Pete and see
what the story is, okay?

749
00:50:00,733 --> 00:50:01,759
Yeah.

750
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:16,508
So much for rest
and the joys of nature.

751
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:18,972
I've always said it. Nature is
a beast that can't be tamed.

752
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:20,444
You have
never said that.

753
00:50:20,446 --> 00:50:21,599
I often say that.

754
00:50:22,303 --> 00:50:23,423
How was your walk?

755
00:50:24,414 --> 00:50:25,375
I got lost.

756
00:50:26,718 --> 00:50:28,639
He was outside the back door.

757
00:50:30,622 --> 00:50:33,248
I think there's something
in the air, not just the smell.

758
00:50:34,366 --> 00:50:35,708
Chemicals or something.

759
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:36,767
Chemicals?

760
00:50:37,662 --> 00:50:38,718
It's all the tea.

761
00:50:39,711 --> 00:50:41,088
That might explain it.

762
00:50:42,367 --> 00:50:43,327
Explain what?

763
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:45,632
I have a headache.

764
00:50:46,431 --> 00:50:47,486
You're hung over.

765
00:50:49,567 --> 00:50:50,528
Okay.

766
00:50:51,391 --> 00:50:53,213
Pete said to stay put.

767
00:50:53,215 --> 00:50:55,293
There was a gas explosion
up by the old mine.

768
00:50:55,295 --> 00:50:57,117
No one hurt, no damage done.

769
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:59,099
That didn't sound
like no damage.

770
00:50:59,101 --> 00:51:01,979
Well, the reception was bad but
he did say everything is fine.

771
00:51:01,981 --> 00:51:03,165
I asked him about fumes

772
00:51:03,167 --> 00:51:05,180
and he said the environment
people have already been up there

773
00:51:05,182 --> 00:51:06,496
and gave it the all-clear.

774
00:51:11,454 --> 00:51:15,611
Look, maybe we've just been
drinking and smoking too much, huh?

775
00:51:15,613 --> 00:51:19,004
Let's just pull out the TV and
watch a movie for a while, yeah?

776
00:51:19,006 --> 00:51:20,092
Hang on.

777
00:51:20,094 --> 00:51:21,055
You have a TV?

778
00:51:22,142 --> 00:51:23,103
Yeah.

779
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:37,024
Stop.

780
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:51,935
Oh, shit!

781
00:51:53,502 --> 00:51:55,516
Just when
it was getting good!

782
00:51:55,518 --> 00:51:56,603
I think,
I think...

783
00:51:56,605 --> 00:51:58,397
It's just the trip-switch.

784
00:51:58,399 --> 00:52:01,373
It goes from time to time.
But God what a time to go!

785
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:06,044
You want a hand?

786
00:52:06,046 --> 00:52:07,581
I'd love it! Nah,
I'm only messing.

787
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:09,052
I've got it.
I've got it.

788
00:52:09,054 --> 00:52:10,015
Okay.

789
00:52:12,734 --> 00:52:14,172
That was
the scariest part.

790
00:52:14,174 --> 00:52:17,536
They taking
proper jumpers.

791
00:52:33,471 --> 00:52:34,783
Jesus Christ!

792
00:52:35,775 --> 00:52:37,055
You scared
the shit out of me!

793
00:52:40,862 --> 00:52:41,951
Are you all right?

794
00:52:55,231 --> 00:52:56,540
Do we need more beers?

795
00:52:56,542 --> 00:52:57,565
I mean, we...

796
00:52:57,567 --> 00:52:59,836
Should we get more beers
before it's too late?

797
00:52:59,838 --> 00:53:01,150
No, we should have plenty.

798
00:53:02,655 --> 00:53:04,156
We can't do anything
about it now anyway,

799
00:53:04,158 --> 00:53:07,100
all the drivers
have been drinking.

800
00:53:07,102 --> 00:53:09,277
I could call Ray.

801
00:53:09,279 --> 00:53:10,527
Good luck with that.

802
00:53:11,711 --> 00:53:12,764
I'm sure the cops around here

803
00:53:12,766 --> 00:53:14,459
won't mind
a little drunk driving.

804
00:53:14,461 --> 00:53:15,678
Don't even say that.

805
00:53:17,342 --> 00:53:19,837
What are we gonna do?
We don't have any beer.

806
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:21,760
I'm sure
you'll think of something.

807
00:53:29,759 --> 00:53:30,815
Oh, I see.

808
00:53:40,702 --> 00:53:42,301
I know you saw us last night.

809
00:53:42,303 --> 00:53:46,204
But really you didn't have to go all crazy
lady shit with the fucking lipstick.

810
00:53:46,206 --> 00:53:47,612
What are you talking about?

811
00:53:47,614 --> 00:53:50,590
I'm talking about the message you
decided to leave on the mirror.

812
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:52,031
Very mature.

813
00:53:52,861 --> 00:53:54,109
Huh.

814
00:53:54,111 --> 00:53:55,486
Look who's talking.

815
00:53:57,886 --> 00:53:59,292
I don't know what happened
last night, right?

816
00:53:59,294 --> 00:54:03,004
Maybe it was the smokes, or whatever
is coming out of that sinkhole.

817
00:54:03,006 --> 00:54:04,509
I mean, even Ger is saying
that things are going...

818
00:54:04,511 --> 00:54:08,827
Jesus, will you take some
responsibility for yourself for once?

819
00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:11,804
For once? I always take
responsibility for myself!

820
00:54:11,806 --> 00:54:15,519
You're always out partying,
or drinking, with men.

821
00:54:17,439 --> 00:54:19,995
What? Oh, my God!

822
00:54:19,997 --> 00:54:21,949
It's not like
you never partied.

823
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:23,388
What's that supposed to mean?

824
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:24,671
You know exactly
what that means.

825
00:54:32,925 --> 00:54:34,399
You're gonna
have to tell Lucy.

826
00:54:36,925 --> 00:54:39,165
And what good
could that possibly do?

827
00:54:39,167 --> 00:54:40,829
It's the right thing to do.

828
00:54:40,831 --> 00:54:42,971
Really? Because I don't
remember you saying that

829
00:54:42,973 --> 00:54:44,575
the last time you saw him
with another woman.

830
00:54:45,279 --> 00:54:47,197
I didn't know her.

831
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:48,443
And what difference
does that make?

832
00:54:48,445 --> 00:54:49,564
Lucy is our friend!

833
00:54:49,566 --> 00:54:52,348
She's your friend really!
I mean, I barely know her.

834
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:53,628
Yeah, she's lovely
and everything

835
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:56,509
but when was the last time we
ever met up for a cup of coffee?

836
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:58,812
Look, this happened
in my house, okay?

837
00:54:58,814 --> 00:55:00,799
You're going to have
to tell her, or I will.

838
00:55:18,205 --> 00:55:22,331
That's weird. I didn't think
there was any reception in here.

839
00:55:22,333 --> 00:55:25,856
Anyway, it's Jason. He says
he's outside with a smoke.

840
00:55:26,686 --> 00:55:28,414
Anyone want to...

841
00:55:29,087 --> 00:55:30,396
I'll pass.

842
00:55:30,398 --> 00:55:31,359
I'm out.

843
00:55:31,966 --> 00:55:33,183
Well, suit yourselves.

844
00:55:36,766 --> 00:55:39,227
Is it just me or are things
getting a bit weird around here?

845
00:55:39,229 --> 00:55:40,415
Mmm-hmm.

846
00:55:43,902 --> 00:55:47,037
God, you don't do things
by halves, anyway.

847
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:48,991
Well, everyone
keeps telling me that.

848
00:55:50,622 --> 00:55:52,894
Sometimes I wish
I was a bit more like you.

849
00:55:55,389 --> 00:55:57,340
You know, more spontaneous.

850
00:55:57,342 --> 00:55:59,422
Well, it's easy. Just do
something spontaneous.

851
00:56:16,191 --> 00:56:17,344
Jason.

852
00:56:44,990 --> 00:56:47,486
What the fuck are they doing out there?
Building a fort?

853
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:50,142
I'll go out,
take a look.

854
00:57:00,829 --> 00:57:01,790
Shane.

855
00:57:06,078 --> 00:57:07,358
Shane!

856
00:57:26,941 --> 00:57:29,052
Well, I don't know
where they are.

857
00:57:29,054 --> 00:57:30,619
I don't know
what they're doing.

858
00:57:30,621 --> 00:57:32,926
I thought I heard them
outside earlier.

859
00:57:33,725 --> 00:57:34,782
Okay.

860
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:40,543
Oh, my God!

861
00:57:41,982 --> 00:57:43,356
Oh, my God.

862
00:57:43,358 --> 00:57:46,300
Go away! Go away.

863
00:57:46,302 --> 00:57:48,764
Oh, my God, he gave me
a heart attack!

864
00:57:48,766 --> 00:57:50,590
I'm gonna kill him.
Oh, my God.

865
00:57:51,966 --> 00:57:53,087
Jesus.

866
00:57:53,822 --> 00:57:54,940
Will you join me now?

867
00:57:54,942 --> 00:57:57,307
Jesus! What was
the screaming about?

868
00:57:57,309 --> 00:57:58,780
Just Shane acting
the maggot again.

869
00:57:58,782 --> 00:58:00,507
Fuck sake.
Are those two still outside?

870
00:58:00,509 --> 00:58:01,595
Mmm-hmm.

871
00:58:01,597 --> 00:58:03,419
They must have
a lot to talk about.

872
00:58:12,702 --> 00:58:13,855
Need a beer.

873
00:58:21,438 --> 00:58:23,291
Lucy, I need
to tell you something.

874
00:58:23,293 --> 00:58:24,379
No. I'll tell her.

875
00:58:24,381 --> 00:58:25,659
No, you won't.

876
00:58:25,661 --> 00:58:30,302
We're planning a big night out
for your birthday next month.

877
00:58:31,134 --> 00:58:32,094
Really?

878
00:58:33,374 --> 00:58:34,971
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

879
00:58:34,973 --> 00:58:37,084
Well, look I wasn't going
to tell you,

880
00:58:37,086 --> 00:58:39,195
but Emma said that we should
just in case you had plans.

881
00:58:39,197 --> 00:58:41,757
That's so nice!

882
00:58:41,759 --> 00:58:43,870
I thought you were going
to tell me something serious.

883
00:58:45,469 --> 00:58:47,294
This isn't a weekend
for serious things.

884
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:51,102
Excuse me a second.

885
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:55,387
Oh, listen, will you call
the lads back in on your way?

886
00:58:55,389 --> 00:58:56,703
Yeah.

887
00:58:58,237 --> 00:58:59,196
It'll be a good night.

888
00:58:59,198 --> 00:59:01,055
Yeah, I really do hope
it will be.

889
00:59:51,902 --> 00:59:54,524
You are snappy.

890
00:59:55,806 --> 00:59:58,300
Emma's such
a drama queen.

891
00:59:58,302 --> 01:00:00,540
She is on her own
in the dark.

892
01:00:00,542 --> 01:00:03,419
That sound freaked me out,
and I was here with you guys.

893
01:00:03,421 --> 01:00:04,603
We should go
and get her.

894
01:00:04,605 --> 01:00:05,951
Come on.

895
01:00:11,999 --> 01:00:13,883
- Jesus!
- We have to get out of here!

896
01:00:13,885 --> 01:00:15,228
What is wrong?

897
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:16,732
Everything's wrong! I can't stay...
I'm not staying here.

898
01:00:16,734 --> 01:00:17,727
What?

899
01:00:18,430 --> 01:00:19,391
Fuck.

900
01:00:20,446 --> 01:00:21,596
What's up with her?

901
01:00:21,598 --> 01:00:24,124
- It has to be the sinkhole. The fumes.
- But Pete said...

902
01:00:24,126 --> 01:00:25,021
I don't care what Pete said!

903
01:00:25,023 --> 01:00:26,684
I lost it out in the woods.
Now Emma...

904
01:00:26,686 --> 01:00:28,508
You think there's
something in the air?

905
01:00:28,510 --> 01:00:31,004
I know there is. This whole
weekend hasn't been right.

906
01:00:31,006 --> 01:00:32,156
Maybe we should leave.

907
01:00:32,158 --> 01:00:34,204
Don't be stupid!
We've all been drinking.

908
01:00:34,206 --> 01:00:35,838
Fuck!

909
01:00:39,486 --> 01:00:40,860
Emma! Wait!

910
01:00:40,862 --> 01:00:42,652
This is fucked up.

911
01:00:42,654 --> 01:00:43,964
Was there anyone
in the car with her?

912
01:00:43,966 --> 01:00:45,403
No, I didn't see anyone.

913
01:00:45,405 --> 01:00:46,719
So where the hell
are the other two?

914
01:00:49,373 --> 01:00:50,334
The fuse box.

915
01:01:05,949 --> 01:01:07,228
I need to find Jason.

916
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:09,499
We should call the police. Emma
was drinking vodka straight...

917
01:01:09,501 --> 01:01:12,348
No, no, no, no, no, no.
We're not calling the police.

918
01:01:12,350 --> 01:01:14,139
She could lose her license!
She could go to prison...

919
01:01:14,141 --> 01:01:14,973
And she might kill someone!

920
01:01:14,975 --> 01:01:16,383
No. We're not
calling the police.

921
01:01:17,374 --> 01:01:18,527
I'm calling the police.

922
01:01:25,693 --> 01:01:26,814
Jason!

923
01:01:30,494 --> 01:01:31,614
Jason!

924
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:37,820
They must be
down by the well.

925
01:01:37,822 --> 01:01:40,124
I'm gonna get Jason then
we'll go after her.

926
01:01:40,126 --> 01:01:41,470
But we've been drinking.

927
01:01:50,013 --> 01:01:51,260
Jason!

928
01:02:12,029 --> 01:02:13,020
Where the hell are you?

929
01:02:13,022 --> 01:02:14,268
<i>...coming to the house...</i>

930
01:02:14,270 --> 01:02:16,475
- Ray...
- <i>Shane and Jason are with me...</i>

931
01:02:16,477 --> 01:02:17,563
Wait. I can't hear you.

932
01:02:17,565 --> 01:02:18,782
- <i>Be long...</i>
- What?

933
01:02:19,677 --> 01:02:21,275
Wait.

934
01:02:21,277 --> 01:02:22,523
- What?
- <i>Coming to get you...</i>

935
01:02:22,525 --> 01:02:23,806
What? Are Shane
and Jason with you?

936
01:02:24,830 --> 01:02:26,395
Ray?

937
01:02:26,397 --> 01:02:28,094
Ray, can you hear me?

938
01:02:28,349 --> 01:02:29,373
Ray!

939
01:02:29,598 --> 01:02:30,783
Shit.

940
01:02:31,358 --> 01:02:32,828
What was that about?

941
01:02:32,830 --> 01:02:35,131
I don't know.
Reception was awful.

942
01:02:35,133 --> 01:02:38,203
I think Ray's on his way and that
Shane and Jason are with him.

943
01:02:38,205 --> 01:02:39,580
How could Shane and Jason
be with him?

944
01:02:39,582 --> 01:02:42,427
I don't know.
We need to find Marissa.

945
01:02:42,429 --> 01:02:44,315
But she's down
by the well.

946
01:02:44,317 --> 01:02:45,948
Do you know where it is?

947
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:47,100
I don't want
to go down there.

948
01:02:47,102 --> 01:02:49,084
She'll be back in a minute.
We should just wait here.

949
01:02:49,086 --> 01:02:50,238
Just show me where it is.

950
01:03:04,958 --> 01:03:06,013
Jason.

951
01:03:10,622 --> 01:03:11,774
Jason!

952
01:03:16,381 --> 01:03:17,883
Jason!

953
01:03:17,885 --> 01:03:19,037
Marissa!

954
01:03:20,510 --> 01:03:22,174
Marissa!

955
01:03:24,317 --> 01:03:25,467
I don't want
to go to the well.

956
01:03:25,469 --> 01:03:27,995
There are signs everywhere,
pointing all over the place.

957
01:03:27,997 --> 01:03:30,751
None of them lead anywhere but
round and round in circles.

958
01:03:31,869 --> 01:03:32,924
We shouldn't go there.

959
01:03:35,230 --> 01:03:36,191
What's that?

960
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:40,030
That's Jason's ringtone.

961
01:03:40,605 --> 01:03:41,855
Come on!

962
01:04:21,437 --> 01:04:22,527
Jason!

963
01:04:26,078 --> 01:04:27,166
Jason!

964
01:04:30,302 --> 01:04:31,390
Jason!

965
01:04:33,117 --> 01:04:34,174
Jason!

966
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:20,444
Oh, fuck.

967
01:05:20,446 --> 01:05:22,364
You fucking stabbed me.

968
01:05:22,366 --> 01:05:24,831
Oh, fuck! I'm so sorry!

969
01:05:25,278 --> 01:05:26,655
It hurts.

970
01:05:27,549 --> 01:05:28,698
I'll get help!

971
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:30,398
Where the fuck
are you going to get help?

972
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:38,175
Oh, God.

973
01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:40,123
Help me.

974
01:05:40,125 --> 01:05:41,919
I'm so sorry. I can't.

975
01:05:57,021 --> 01:06:01,275
Jason! Shane!

976
01:06:01,277 --> 01:06:03,355
Are you sure this is a good idea?
I mean, these woods...

977
01:06:03,357 --> 01:06:05,244
Something might have
happened to them.

978
01:06:05,246 --> 01:06:07,003
But didn't you say
they were with Ray?

979
01:06:07,005 --> 01:06:09,151
I don't know.
I couldn't hear him properly.

980
01:06:16,189 --> 01:06:17,917
I think it's coming
from over there.

981
01:06:30,942 --> 01:06:32,031
Jason.

982
01:06:32,797 --> 01:06:33,883
Jason!

983
01:06:33,885 --> 01:06:37,566
Pete? No, this is Lucy.
I'm a friend of Jason's.

984
01:06:40,542 --> 01:06:41,695
What? Why?

985
01:06:45,982 --> 01:06:48,251
He said we've gotta
get out of here right now.

986
01:06:48,253 --> 01:06:49,499
- Why?
- I don't know.

987
01:06:49,501 --> 01:06:50,686
He sounded scared.

988
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:53,628
Let's go.

989
01:06:53,630 --> 01:06:54,907
We can't!
What about Jason?

990
01:06:54,909 --> 01:06:55,900
He's not here!

991
01:06:55,902 --> 01:06:57,663
I'm not getting lost out
in the woods again.

992
01:07:03,165 --> 01:07:04,127
Come on, Lucy!

993
01:07:16,124 --> 01:07:17,151
No no no...

994
01:07:19,229 --> 01:07:21,917
No. Please, no.

995
01:07:25,917 --> 01:07:27,164
Emma!

996
01:07:27,166 --> 01:07:28,542
Emma! Wait!

997
01:07:29,564 --> 01:07:30,750
Emma!

998
01:07:31,932 --> 01:07:33,341
Emma!

999
01:08:38,076 --> 01:08:39,898
We were never
this far from the house.

1000
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:41,914
I told you. There's
something in the air.

1001
01:08:41,916 --> 01:08:43,035
Do you drive?

1002
01:08:43,037 --> 01:08:44,059
No. You?

1003
01:08:44,061 --> 01:08:45,631
No. But Marissa does.

1004
01:09:48,668 --> 01:09:49,886
Ray! He's back!

1005
01:10:41,501 --> 01:10:42,525
Ray!

1006
01:10:42,876 --> 01:10:43,869
Ray!

1007
01:10:48,414 --> 01:10:49,405
Ray?

1008
01:10:51,133 --> 01:10:52,186
Ray?

1009
01:10:55,998 --> 01:10:57,883
Ray? Are you okay?

1010
01:10:57,885 --> 01:11:00,574
Ray? Ray's more than okay.

1011
01:11:03,005 --> 01:11:04,510
He's fucking great!

1012
01:11:18,429 --> 01:11:20,157
It's me! It's me!

1013
01:11:24,798 --> 01:11:26,972
It's me. It's me.
Be cool.

1014
01:11:26,974 --> 01:11:28,188
I saw something.

1015
01:11:28,190 --> 01:11:29,499
I did too.

1016
01:11:29,501 --> 01:11:30,812
We have to
get out of here.

1017
01:11:30,814 --> 01:11:32,477
That's what I've been
saying all along.

1018
01:11:34,684 --> 01:11:36,603
It's Ray. It's Ray.

1019
01:11:36,605 --> 01:11:38,269
Ray! Ray!

1020
01:11:38,589 --> 01:11:40,475
Ray! Ray!

1021
01:11:40,477 --> 01:11:41,823
That's not Ray!

1022
01:11:43,453 --> 01:11:46,046
Ray! Ray!

1023
01:11:46,908 --> 01:11:47,995
I saw him!

1024
01:11:47,997 --> 01:11:49,115
It's a fucking creature!

1025
01:11:49,117 --> 01:11:50,463
Ray!

1026
01:11:52,924 --> 01:11:54,014
Ray!

1027
01:11:57,693 --> 01:12:01,659
Ray! Wait for me!
We have to get out of here!

1028
01:12:01,661 --> 01:12:03,198
No one
is getting out of here.

1029
01:12:18,844 --> 01:12:20,542
Ray! Where are you?

1030
01:12:22,589 --> 01:12:23,774
I'm not here.

1031
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:29,563
You're scaring me!

1032
01:12:29,565 --> 01:12:32,478
It's not a sinkhole.
It's just fun for them.

1033
01:12:38,684 --> 01:12:39,774
- Ray!
- Stay where you are!

1034
01:12:40,861 --> 01:12:42,522
We're all gone.

1035
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:43,933
All except you and Ger.

1036
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:50,298
If you want to live tonight, you'll
have to sacrifice your soul.

1037
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:52,509
It needs seven souls,
it can't go back with less.

1038
01:12:53,469 --> 01:12:54,428
What?

1039
01:12:54,430 --> 01:12:57,981
I can't save anyone else.
Neither can you.

1040
01:12:59,230 --> 01:13:02,268
This is the only way.

1041
01:13:02,270 --> 01:13:06,108
Sacrifice your soul tonight, and you'll
have the rest of your life to earn it back.

1042
01:13:06,110 --> 01:13:08,411
But we can leave now.

1043
01:13:08,413 --> 01:13:10,270
It's too late for me.

1044
01:13:12,861 --> 01:13:14,238
Let me save you.

1045
01:13:45,181 --> 01:13:47,037
Lucy. Thank God.

1046
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:49,182
I thought you were gone.

1047
01:13:51,485 --> 01:13:54,364
We have to get out of here.
Come on.

1048
01:13:54,366 --> 01:13:55,870
We have to
get out of here.

1049
01:13:57,405 --> 01:13:58,683
We have to
go back to the house.

1050
01:13:58,685 --> 01:14:00,254
We can't go back there.

1051
01:14:01,182 --> 01:14:02,426
Why?

1052
01:14:02,428 --> 01:14:03,677
Because Ray is there.

1053
01:14:04,957 --> 01:14:07,070
Even though
he's not Ray anymore.

1054
01:14:08,028 --> 01:14:09,373
What do you mean?

1055
01:14:10,716 --> 01:14:11,965
He's dead.

1056
01:14:12,892 --> 01:14:14,590
Everyone is dead.

1057
01:14:17,117 --> 01:14:18,462
Oh. Jesus Christ.

1058
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:34,686
Ray said that
he's going to help us.

1059
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:37,979
But I thought you just said
that he was dead?

1060
01:14:37,981 --> 01:14:40,570
No, I spoke to him.

1061
01:14:40,572 --> 01:14:42,522
He said he's
going to buy us time.

1062
01:14:42,524 --> 01:14:44,893
But we have
to leave now, okay?

1063
01:15:26,173 --> 01:15:27,707
Wait a minute!

1064
01:15:27,709 --> 01:15:29,434
Aren't we running
towards the sinkhole?

1065
01:15:29,436 --> 01:15:30,747
We have to go this way!

1066
01:15:30,749 --> 01:15:33,498
The sinkhole is where all these
fucking things are coming from!

1067
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:34,395
We have to turn back.

1068
01:15:34,397 --> 01:15:36,414
We can't turn back.
You have to trust me.

1069
01:15:43,485 --> 01:15:44,860
I want to go back.

1070
01:15:44,862 --> 01:15:46,269
I want to go back.

1071
01:16:01,245 --> 01:16:02,301
I'm sorry!

1072
01:16:04,637 --> 01:16:06,299
What have you done?

1073
01:16:06,301 --> 01:16:07,485
What have you done!

1074
01:16:08,957 --> 01:16:09,979
Help!

1075
01:16:09,981 --> 01:16:11,002
Help me!

1076
01:17:20,064 --> 01:17:25,064
