1
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,343
<i>It's okay,
you're gonna love it!</i>

2
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,305
<i>Happy first day of school.</i>

3
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,100
<i>Bye, sweetie.</i>

4
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:00,018
<i>Hi!
Hi.</i>

5
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,521
<i>Hey, I'm Sam.</i>

6
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:04,064
<i>Hi, I'm Julie.</i>

7
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:07,818
- Bye!
- Bye, Mom!

8
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,363
I'm Hunter.

9
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,199
Sam's mine, right there.
The one with the glasses.

10
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,618
I'm Lisa.
That's my Julie.

11
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,496
I'm Mitchell.

12
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,124
Kayla's hero.

13
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,793
Oh. Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah.

14
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,128
You crying?

15
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:28,422
No, man.
It's a big day, that's all.

16
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:29,631
You know, can I have
a tissue, please?

17
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:30,799
Yeah, yeah.
Thank you.

18
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:32,175
It's a big day for all of us.
Yeah.

19
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,635
Thanks.

20
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,682
I think our daughters
are friends.

21
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:41,852
And I think that means
we're friends.

22
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,732
Should we go get a drink?

23
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,443
You okay? Yeah.
Yeah.

24
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,403
Do you guys wanna
go get a drink?

25
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,531
Ah, they made it.

26
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:55,824
You guys wanna go
grab a drink real quick?

27
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:57,492
Is he asking us if we wanna
go grab a drink?

28
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,036
I'm really hoping
it's coffee.

29
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,881
<i>Shut the fuck up!</i>

30
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,843
<i>Happy Halloween!</i>

31
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:15,927
<i>Assalam!</i>

32
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:18,096
<i>I can see Russia
from my house!</i>

33
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:29,232
<i>That's right!
Right here! Whoo!</i>

34
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,152
Hey, hey...

35
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,073
<i>Put your seatbelts on!</i>

36
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:42,412
<i>Surprise!</i>

37
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:48,502
Careful!

38
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,701
You're probably gonna miss these
mornings that we spend together, right?

39
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,119
Stop.

40
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,122
You're gonna make me cry, and I don't
wanna cry because it's prom night.

41
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,749
It's supposed to be like the
most magical night of your life,

42
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,835
and, you know, I'm just
so anxious aboutfl.

43
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:34,297
Well, call me
if you feel anxious.

44
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,758
Or maybe FaceTime me,
if it wasn't too loud.

45
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:40,512
If it was too loud, you could just...
We could wave or whatever.

46
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:41,722
That'd be funny.

47
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:42,973
And then, loan...

48
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,349
You know
what I was thinking?

49
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:47,060
You should send me photos
throughout the night.

50
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:51,940
Not like all night long, but if you
could do it every 30 minutes or so

51
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:54,401
then I can put together
one of those iBooks.

52
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,694
That would be so fun.
Yeah.

53
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:57,696
That would be a really... I don't
think you would regret that.

54
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,198
Hmm.

55
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:01,450
Mom?
Mmm-hmm.

56
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,662
Are you gonna be okay
when I go to college?

57
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,539
Who, me?
Yeah.

58
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,082
<i>Me'?</i>

59
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:12,169
What?

60
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,756
Please. Don't even
get me...

61
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:16,965
Don't even...

62
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,177
Please!

63
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,307
Okay, bye, Mom!

64
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,391
Okay, bye!

65
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,143
I love you!
Okay, I love you.

66
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,110
Oh, good,
you did the laundry.

67
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,155
Yeah, and got a totally
sleepy, happy baby.

68
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,324
Full-blown renaissance man.

69
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,950
Oh!
Beheveit

70
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,702
It's a good thing
she's asleep, too.

71
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:46,870
I was going
through the laundry.

72
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,663
Uh-huh.
Found these new thongs.

73
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,998
You know what I'm gonna
do with these?

74
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,627
"Paging Dr. Muff Diver.
Dr. Muff Diver,

75
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,087
"you're needed in the OR
immediately, emergency surgery."

76
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,881
Later on tonight, I'm tearing
these off with my teeth

77
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,050
like an old-school
cartoon billy goat.

78
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:02,427
Honey. Mitchell.

79
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,264
Those are your daughter's.

80
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,851
No way. Kayla wears
cleats and Bears jerseys,

81
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,144
not some dirty stripper
undenuean

82
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,312
You thought they were mine.

83
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,105
What am I, giving her
allowance in singles?

84
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,732
Go tell her
she can't wear these.

85
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,025
Tell her
they'll make her sterile,

86
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,819
like with the laptop
and my brother's balls.

87
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,821
We're not sure that's what
happened with your brother.

88
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,531
Honey, you're being
ridiculous.

89
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:23,907
Kayla's becoming a woman.

90
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:26,451
This isn't the time to tighten your grip.
It's the time to loosen it.

91
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,745
This? This means
we tighten the grip.

92
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,956
This isn't built for comfort,
it's built for speed.

93
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,165
We need to slow her
the fuck down.

94
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,335
The appliances go in
after the backsplash.

95
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,629
We've done it
the same way every time.

96
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:42,008
Uh-huh. All right,
put him on the phone.

97
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,429
I'm in the bathroom.

98
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,328
Thanks,
I was looking for that.

99
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:13,832
You mind telling me
what this is?

100
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,667
Uh, fuzz.
Yeah.

101
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:16,835
Yeah, fuzz.

102
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,129
It's what I thought it was and
then on further investigation,

103
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,506
it is clearly an unraveled
filter of a cigarette.

104
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,425
Kayla, are you a smoker?

105
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:24,926
What? No.

106
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,095
I'm not a smoker, Dad.

107
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:31,016
Hey, haven't you seen the billions of
ads that tell you not to do this stuff?

108
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,435
Dad! You can't teach someone
not to try things. Okay?

109
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,896
That's what trying things
is for. To teach you things.

110
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,063
It's a contradiction.

111
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:41,234
It's like telling me not to go for
a triple on a base hit to the gap

112
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,777
when I've made
a good turn around first

113
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,738
and I know that the right
fielder has a weak arm.

114
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:48,158
Damn it, you're smart.

115
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,578
Okay. Yeah. All right. Time
to get ready for school, Dad.

116
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:52,829
Okay, all right.

117
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,373
Julie! Sam!

118
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,583
Hey, girl!

119
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,751
Whoa!

120
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:00,837
I almost died.

121
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,256
Prom night!

122
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,550
I'm so, so excited!

123
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:06,760
Me, too.

124
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,140
Mmm. I love you.

125
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,975
I love you, too.

126
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,226
All right.

127
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,561
We're so gross.
I know.

128
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,063
People are looking at us.
I don't care.

129
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,065
We better get "Cutest
Couple" in the yearbook.

130
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:32,619
I'm having sex.

131
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:36,831
- That's great!
- I'm having soup.

132
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,333
No. Tonight.

133
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,501
With Austin.

134
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,294
Wait, you're finally gonna do it?
Yeah.

135
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:45,131
I mean, you know, we've been dating
for six months and we love each other

136
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,385
and I just awkwardly got my pediatrician
to put me on birth control.

137
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,470
But she gave me
a sticker.

138
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,222
Two because
I was good, so...

139
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:57,018
I know it's kind of corny or whatever
but it just seems like prom night,

140
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,728
it's kind of perfect,
you know?

141
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,690
We're gonna have,
like, dim lighting

142
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,483
and rose petals on the bed

143
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,443
and the scent from that candle
that gets me horny

144
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,153
every time I pass it
in Walgreens.

145
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,613
All candles get me horny.

146
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,198
I'm gonna
look into Austin's eyes

147
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,909
and then he's gonna
look into mine

148
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:16,496
and then we're gonna touch
each other's faces, you know?

149
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,164
For, like, a long time.

150
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,000
Like, a long time.

151
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,503
Just to, like, connect.
And then we're gonna...

152
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,755
Ka pow.

153
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,009
All right, fuck it, I'm in.

154
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,510
- What?
- I'm in.

155
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:31,594
I'm having sex tonight, too.

156
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,471
Uh...
Just like that?

157
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:34,556
Yeah. I mean, why not?

158
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,682
Because it's your first time

159
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:38,643
and your first time should be
special and perfect.

160
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,061
Yours can be special
and perfect.

161
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:43,898
Mine is gonna be tonight,
and with that dude.

162
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,567
They're just brownies,
they're not, like...

163
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:48,361
Connor Aldrich?
Your lab partner?

164
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,113
Yeah. What? You haven't
even hooked up with him.

165
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,615
You haven't even seen his thing yet.
What if he has a weird one?

166
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:53,867
They're all weird.

167
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,453
Penises are not for looking
at, they're for use.

168
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,163
They're like plungers. Listen,

169
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,789
my student athlete days
are over.

170
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,000
Tonight is the beginning
of my adult life

171
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,669
and for the first time
I can do whatever I want.

172
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:08,089
So I wanna go to prom, get drunk,
get potted up on weed

173
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,716
andlose
my goddamn virginity.

174
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,551
We're gonna have the same
first-time sex anniversary.

175
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,303
We can go to dinner every year
and commemorate it.

176
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,305
Olive Garden.
Yes! Olive Garden.

177
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:16,973
Breadsticks for life, bitch!

178
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,477
Oh, my God! It is gonna
be such a relief

179
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,896
to get this over and done
with before college.

180
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,565
Um...

181
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,025
No, I mean, like...
No, it's cool.

182
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,027
I just don't think
I'm there yet.

183
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:32,614
You know, maybe something might
happen tonight with me and Chad,

184
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:36,868
but I don't think sex
is gonna be that thing.

185
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,169
Sam?

186
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,549
But you never know
what could happen.

187
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,761
I mean, maybe my inner sexual
Smaug will emerge from its keep

188
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,638
and spread its mighty wings.

189
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,308
I never know
what you're talking about.

190
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,102
Yeah, me neither.

191
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,612
Oh...

192
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:27,710
Julie, is that you?

193
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,719
So realistic.

194
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,142
Ugh.

195
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,896
Come on, Sam,
we're waiting.

196
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,773
Be right there!

197
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,234
All right.
There she is.

198
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,111
Took me 20 minutes to figure out
how to do video on this thing

199
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:54,612
but I finally got it.

200
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,239
Nope.

201
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,532
I took a picture of myself.

202
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,826
Siri, video, please.

203
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:03,705
Wow! That Chad is going to rip
through his little tuxedo pants.

204
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:04,873
Mom!
What?

205
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,291
That's gross.
Why?

206
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,544
Because you're practically imagining
your daughter in sexual congress.

207
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:10,712
You sicko.

208
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:16,759
I was just trying to connect with you.
You never talk to us anymore.

209
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,261
Hey, I got this.

210
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:19,429
Okay.

211
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,018
Prom night, huh?

212
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,812
I got sad and reflective
on my prom night, too.

213
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:28,897
You were?
Yeah.

214
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,398
I was scared I wasn't
gonna stay friends

215
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,025
with the guys I had been
around most of my life.

216
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,109
But I was able to...

217
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,653
Hey, baby, I love you so much.
You just really freaked her out.

218
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:40,658
Sweetie, if you're worried about that
at all, just know you shouldn't be.

219
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,119
You never stay friends
with people from high school.

220
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,330
I mean, the oldest friend
I have is Jan from work

221
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,497
and I've known her
for three months.

222
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:47,582
Who's Jan?

223
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,001
You know Jan, babe. She
draws those silly cartoons.

224
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,419
Oh, racist Jan.

225
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,503
Yeah, that's the one.

226
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:53,755
Who you are today

227
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:57,425
is not who you're going to be.
And that's okay.

228
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,802
That's good therapy.
And who you become will be

229
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,472
so different that your friends
won't understand you anymore

230
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,140
and then you will wake up
and realize

231
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:07,685
these friendships are over. This
feels like a very painful divorce,

232
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,229
just like the one I had
with your father,

233
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,522
but then you'll find a Frank.

234
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:14,609
Uh, I appreciate that,
but that's not my deal.

235
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:17,278
I'm still cool with a lot of
my boys because on prom night,

236
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:23,409
me, Dennis, Matt, and Cory all convinced
our friend Steve to join the Army.

237
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,453
He fought
in the Persian Gulf War.

238
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,163
He died right away.

239
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,208
But once you go
through something like that,

240
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,418
you're bonded for life.

241
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:36,047
The bedrock of deep meaningful
friendships is shared experience.

242
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,468
I thought they were gonna
put him in the Reserves.

243
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,683
That is some horseshit.

244
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,022
Hmm.

245
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,531
Wow.

246
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,783
You look so beautiful!

247
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,160
Turn around.

248
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,956
Wow.

249
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,416
Oh, my goodness.

250
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:13,418
Wow.

251
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,170
So what's the big plan
for after prom?

252
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:18,172
Uh, we're just
going to Austin's.

253
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,590
You really like him, huh?

254
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:23,678
Yeah. Yeah, I mean... Yeah, he's cool.
It's not like serious or anything.

255
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,805
His mom told me
he got into UCLA.

256
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:26,973
That's nice.

257
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,766
Yeah, I mean, it's good.

258
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:32,854
You remember that time when, like,
I thought about going to UCLA?

259
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:33,938
Yes.

260
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:37,025
That would've been crazy. That
would've been the worst mistake ever.

261
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,819
I don't think it would've been
that huge of a mistake.

262
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,572
Uh,yes,
it would have.

263
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:46,743
University of Chicago is perfect.
It's 45 minutes away.

264
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:50,371
So that way you're gone
but you're not gone, gone.

265
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,206
But I'm gone.

266
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,709
Right. But not, like, gone.

267
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,461
Right, but, like,
I'm going to college

268
00:13:56,627 --> 00:14:00,298
and, like, I'm not gonna live at home.
So I'm, like, I'm gone.

269
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:01,966
Mmm-hmm.

270
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,719
Why are my boobs so big?

271
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,012
Ready, Kayla?

272
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:07,138
Yep.

273
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,851
And now, standing at 5' 7",

274
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,395
5' 9" if you count the heels,

275
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:18,149
straight out of Great Lakes High School,
the prettiest girl in all of prom,

276
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,651
Kayla Mannes.

277
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,906
Oh.

278
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,324
Just high-fives from now on.

279
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,909
Okay.

280
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:29,410
Oh, honey, I never thought
I'd see you in a dress!

281
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,204
Technically
it's not a full dress.

282
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,247
Some material is missing
from the middle there.

283
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,415
Okay.

284
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:35,500
You look great.

285
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,627
All right, yeah,
I think it's time to go.

286
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,921
Yes. Yeah. Honey,
we gotta go.

287
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,090
Honey?

288
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,883
Dad, are you okay?

289
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,260
It's like when
he watched Frozen.

290
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,554
Come on.

291
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,766
Hi, how are you?

292
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,684
Hi!
Hi! How are you?

293
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:54,936
Hi, Marcie.

294
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,854
Oh. Uh-huh.

295
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:58,398
Hey!
Hey, Mitchell.

296
00:14:58,481 --> 00:14:59,732
Haven't seen you in a while.
Yeah.

297
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,943
You know, I was worried when I never
heard back from you about hot yoga.

298
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:05,780
Called you a bunch of times. I ended up
having to eat that two-for-one Groupon.

299
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:07,407
Oh, yeah, I don't really
do the hot-yoga thing.

300
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,867
We should catch up, though,
right?

301
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,327
Yeah.
Like a lunch, I don't know.

302
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:13,204
Yeah, maybe. Yeah.
Give me a call.

303
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,622
I've been calling you.
Mmm-hmm.

304
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,290
It doesn't work.

305
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,708
It's not effective.

306
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,018
I don't even know!
Wait, you guys.

307
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,521
Wait, this is, like, the best
lighting with the Valencia filter...

308
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,356
Oh, God. All right.
Here we go.

309
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:42,567
Yeah, okay. That's enough.

310
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,651
One more.
We're good.

311
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,778
Oh, my God, we need to
get this party started.

312
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,113
Ooh, okay, Julie.
Hmm.

313
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,281
I got you something.

314
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:50,700
It's coconut oil.

315
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,493
For lube.

316
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:55,872
I hear it works just as well and it
makes blowjobs taste like Almond Joy.

317
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,124
Thank God it doesn't
taste like Mounds.

318
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,209
I'd rather eat 10 dicks
than one Mound.

319
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,962
Thank you. That's so sweet!

320
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,381
Oh, my God, I'm so excited.

321
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,717
Me, too. You have to text me,
like, right away.

322
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,469
Oh, my God, we're gonna be
doing it at the same time.

323
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,471
Oh, my God. We have
to talk about it tomorrow.

324
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,722
Yeah. You're gonna know
every detail.

325
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,932
There's gonna be so much to talk...
Guys? Hey, guys!

326
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,311
I want in on this sex pact.

327
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:21,481
Are you sure? You don't have to
do this just because we are.

328
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,899
No, that's not why.

329
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,109
I want to have sex.

330
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:28,154
Yeah. That's something all
three of us have in common.

331
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:33,993
Mmm-hmm. Chad is gonna tap
that ass with his penis

332
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:36,996
and I doubt we'll have anal
the first time, but...

333
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:39,290
All right!

334
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,416
This is gonna make tonight
even more perfect.

335
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:41,584
Yeah.
It's gonna be the three of us!

336
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,503
Yes!

337
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,588
Prom night,
motherfuckers!

338
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:48,049
Yeah!

339
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,759
Whoo!

340
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,719
Rudy, it's coming up.
Turn left, bro.

341
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,931
Jesus, Rudy!
What the fuck?

342
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,351
Oh, my God.
It's my fucking dad.

343
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:08,110
Yeah! Prom night,
bflchesl

344
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,905
Whoo-hoo!

345
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,699
Oh, God, it's him.
Arms up. Yo!

346
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:18,871
<i>We gonna light
it up like it's prom night</i>

347
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,831
Taio Cruz.

348
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,291
<i>Like it's prom night</i>

349
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,668
You got this, girl.

350
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,712
Don't mess this up because
that limo is totally awesome.

351
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,632
Sam!Sam!

352
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:31,968
Taio Cruz. Whoo.

353
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,305
Sorry.

354
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,015
30W. on!

355
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,684
Whoo.

356
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:48,943
You're so grown up!

357
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,653
Dad, what are you doing here?

358
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:55,241
You think I'm gonna miss the most
important night of your young lfie?

359
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,325
That's graduation.

360
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,619
No. Graduation's for losers.

361
00:17:58,786 --> 00:17:59,996
I didn't even go
to my graduation.

362
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,248
But prom night,
that's a big one.

363
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,375
Prom was the best night
of my life.

364
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,043
I think about it every day

365
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,837
and I want you to have
the same experience.

366
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,380
Tonight you have fun,

367
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:12,717
you don't worry about any rules
that your mom or Frank laid down.

368
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,427
No one gives
a fuck about Frank.

369
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,179
All I know is this. You look amazing
and I would love to grab a quick pic.

370
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:21,267
No. Go stand with the other
parents and try to be normal.

371
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,269
Sam, I'm not a normal parent.

372
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:24,812
I don't even...

373
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,188
Holy shit,
you invited Hunter?

374
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:27,356
No, of course not.

375
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,400
I haven't talked to him since
he and Brenda got divorced.

376
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,235
You know he calls me all the time?
What?

377
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:32,945
He wants to play darts.
I don't play darts!

378
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,572
Darts?
You kidding me?

379
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,449
Anyway, I can't hang out with him.
I'll be guilty by association.

380
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:39,619
No. No, l will never forgive
that babysitter fucker.

381
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:41,245
Hey, Hunter!
Hey, man. Good to see you.

382
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:42,663
What up?

383
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,458
Ah...
Ah!

384
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:48,711
Did you have
another daughter?

385
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,588
I did. I did.

386
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,757
Thank you. It's been wonderful.
Yeah.

387
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,551
I'm thinking about doing that again.
You know, the whole second round?

388
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:58,429
I think a lot of dads kind of get
it right the second time around.

389
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,891
Or, you know, you could just
raise the one that you have.

390
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:04,894
Well, I did. Too late for that.
Raised, job done.

391
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,979
Hi, honey.
Actually, I heard

392
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,358
if you spend a significant amount
of time with your children

393
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:14,695
that you develop some kind of,
like, telekinetic bond with them.

394
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,614
Is that true?
I've heard. Mmm-hmm.

395
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:20,201
I hope it's not true because if it is, Sam
has been looking at a lot of Asian porn.

396
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,329
My wife's Asian.

397
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,831
Indian.
That's Asian.

398
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,625
This is more like, uh...

399
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,920
It looks like the typical Asian.
Yep, good seeing you, man.

400
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,463
Okay, good to see you, brother.
You know what I mean.

401
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,549
Who's this guy?
Who are you?

402
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:36,717
Dad, this is my date.

403
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:37,802
Hi.

404
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,720
Uh, it's great to meet you,
sir. I'm... I'm Connor.

405
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,014
Connor and I were in the same
science class. We're lab partners.

406
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,309
Yeah. We're working
on our chemistry.

407
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:46,852
Uh...

408
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:50,272
I'm gonna get a napkin,
if that's cool.

409
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,774
Okay.

410
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,486
Okay, so, uh...

411
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,864
With this, it's one shot
to the groin, stab, and drag.

412
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,660
I refuse to believe she couldn't
do better than that loser.

413
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,704
Oh, I think Chad seems nice.

414
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,498
Chad? No, Chad's amazing.
Look at that fedora.

415
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,834
I'm not talking about Chad, I'm
talking about fucking Frank.

416
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,001
What a dick.

417
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,921
Frank does not seem
like a dick to me.

418
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:15,506
He seems like a nice guy.
And you know what?

419
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:18,509
Don't blame Brenda.
It's really hard being alone.

420
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:20,302
Let's just agree
to disagree on Frank.

421
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,304
Here they come.
Okay, just be cool.

422
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,223
He's gonna talk about his
tow truck company instantly.

423
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,017
I guarantee you he's gonna
throw that shit in my face.

424
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,519
Be cool, be cool, be cool.

425
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,938
Brenda.
Hunter.

426
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:33,107
Frank.

427
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,191
Lisa.

428
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:35,609
What'd I do?

429
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,779
I'm sorry, I don't know why I just said
your name like that. This is so nice.

430
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,281
Thank you.
You're welcome.

431
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,368
Okay.

432
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:45,828
No,no,no.
Leese,Leese,Leese.

433
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,663
I gotta go get
Julie's wrap.

434
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,457
Mmm.

435
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,084
Were you gonna let our daughter
take a fucking Lyft to prom?

436
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,252
What is this, Afghanistan?

437
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:54,670
How'd you pay
for that limo, Hunter?

438
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:55,963
'Cause I know your credit's
in the shitter.

439
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,423
It is.

440
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,467
Because I bought
your mom a wheelchair.

441
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:00,801
She's gonna pay you back.

442
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,094
With what money, Brenda?

443
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,180
Can she pay me back with crackers
that she steals from restaurants?

444
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,390
I don't wanna talk about your mom, I
don't wanna talk about her wheelohair.

445
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:09,477
All I care about is that my daughter
has the greatest night of her life.

446
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,687
If it was her greatest night,
you would not be here.

447
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,690
Oh, what a sick burn. All
right, all right, all right.

448
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:16,650
Good. Wait,yo,yo,yo,
we're all adults here.

449
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,028
Let's not make it
uncomfortable.

450
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:21,489
If you're gonna be around more,
let's have a beer sometime.

451
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,283
Okay, first of all, I don't wanna
go to have a beer with you.

452
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,368
I don't wanna hang out with you. I don't
like you, I don't like your wife.

453
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:29,038
I don't like your guys' deal. I
think it sucks and it's played out.

454
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:31,540
Hey, if you ever change
your mind, here's my card.

455
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:32,708
Ah, here we go.

456
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,211
"Tow with Frank." Where'd you
come up with that name?

457
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,129
It's very straightforward.
All right, I'll tell you this.

458
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,798
The design of that card
is pretty cool.

459
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,508
And my favorite part
is right fucking there.

460
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:41,842
Oh.

461
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,708
Wow, that is just...
No, that's us, Frank.

462
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,086
You've taken about 15 goddamn selfies.
I got it. I got it.

463
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:18,963
Yeah!
All right.

464
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:21,215
Bye, Mom.

465
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,800
- Have fun, honey. Okay.
- I will.

466
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,051
Bye,Dad.

467
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,846
Remember, stab, turn, drag.

468
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,013
I don't have the knife, Dad.

469
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,181
Yes, you do.
Check your clutch.

470
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:30,724
Ugh.

471
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,143
Hey, uh,
it's been a pleasure, sir.

472
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,521
I really, um...
I'm honored.

473
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:37,606
Oh!

474
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,609
Intense, professional grip.
Cheers!

475
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:42,361
Take it easy,
big guy. Hey, uh...

476
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,031
You guys have
a good night, too, you know.

477
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,199
Thank you.

478
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:49,201
See that smirk?
What was up with that smirk?

479
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:51,161
You are intense.

480
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:52,288
Sam.
Oh.

481
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,789
Hey! Mr. Lockwood.
Hey!

482
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:54,874
Pleasure to meet you.
Chad, yes.

483
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:57,293
Come on, man. Bring it in.
Yes. Good. Yeah.

484
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:58,752
My hat?

485
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:01,005
I wanna talk to Sam real quick.
Yeah, okay.

486
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:02,965
Let me get a picture
real quick.

487
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,008
Chad.
Oh.

488
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:05,467
Real quick photo. Just,
just so fast. Okay.

489
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,469
Don't even fuck with the filter.
Just plain.

490
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,221
Here we go.
There we go.

491
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,140
And then you wanna get a quick
one of me and Chad real quick?

492
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:12,683
That sounds cool. Yep.
Okay.

493
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:15,269
Sammy, here you go, baby. Real quick.
Just a couple fun ones.

494
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:16,395
Like this?

495
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,147
Bros.

496
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:19,732
Duck lips.

497
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,859
And then just kind of a...

498
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,904
Julie. Can I talk to you
a second?

499
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,822
We gotta go.
I love you.

500
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:27,948
I'd really like
to talk to you.

501
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:29,491
But I really gotta go.

502
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,160
Okay, fine. Just don't
forget your wrap.

503
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,329
It's okay. I don't think
lneedit

504
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:34,496
Are you sure?

505
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,291
Because we live in Chicago,
and it's chilly.

506
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:38,959
I don't know
about other places,

507
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:42,379
but it gets cold
in Illinois.

508
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:46,050
It's not that cold tonight, so
I don't think I need it, okay?

509
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,134
Okay, Julie, wait.

510
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:49,511
So you'll call me when you get
to Austin's after prom? Right?

511
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:50,679
Right.

512
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:52,306
Okay.

513
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,099
Okay.
I love you.

514
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,893
Okay. I love you.

515
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,437
Okay!

516
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,732
Okay.

517
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,156
This is so cool!

518
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,033
on!

519
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,077
Blow it out!

520
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,829
Chad, I, um, I saw you
do <i>Pippin</i> last year.

521
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,164
That was really good.

522
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,793
Yeah, you're a really good singer, man.
What are you doing this year?

523
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,588
We're actually doing Arnold,
which is <i>an</i> all-male version of Annie.

524
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,132
Caught you drinking!

525
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,385
Just kidding, y'all.
I may look like a parent

526
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,512
but I assure you,
I am no narc.

527
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:33,597
Thank you, sir.

528
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,559
Not done yet.
Name's Rudy.

529
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,103
I did not go to my prom. No.

530
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:42,648
My leg was crushed by a cement
truck so I could not dance but...

531
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,900
So I've made it
my mission in life,

532
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:48,404
my whole career, to make sure
that little kids like you

533
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,406
have a wonderful night
to remember forever.

534
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:54,284
So just sit back, relax,
and enjoy your prom night.

535
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:56,578
Okay.

536
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,372
Oh, fuck,
that was the turn! Fuck!

537
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,167
Hey, Leese?

538
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,169
You got any S.O.S. pads?

539
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,589
I'm soaking those pans, but you burnt
the shit out of that mac: and cheese.

540
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,467
Sponge just isn't
gonna cut it.

541
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:12,428
Thanks for helping clean up.

542
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,221
Don't mention this one.

543
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:17,433
I mean, Marcie brought
the baby home early and...

544
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:21,770
I gotta keep busy. I gotta keep my
mind off of Kayla and "Connor."

545
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,898
That's not the right way
to use those.

546
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:28,235
'Cause his name
is actually Connor. So...

547
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:31,405
It's okay.

548
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:33,907
UCLA?
Uh-huh.

549
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:35,117
I didn't mean to snoop,
but I'm...

550
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,201
No, no. It's okay.

551
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:37,411
I mean, I don't think
it's a real thing.

552
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,747
She's not actually gonna go.

553
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:42,583
I think she just applied
for fun. She didn't...

554
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,917
Why, have you heard
differently?

555
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:48,630
I would assume it's to go, but she very
well could have applied ironically.

556
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,007
I mean,
you know millennials, right?

557
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,592
Hmm.
Wherever she goes...

558
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,552
You're gonna have a bunch
of time on your hands.

559
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,846
You oan figure out what you wanna
do for the back nine of your life.

560
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,598
Uh-huh. Yeah.

561
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:01,310
I think Julie
left her laptop open.

562
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,604
Julie's doing
a lot of texting.

563
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:05,314
Mmm-hmm.
ls everything okay?

564
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,483
Maybe we should
check to see?

565
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,026
Peace of mind.
Yeah.

566
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,074
What the hell is that?

567
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,867
I have no idea.

568
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,288
What are you
still doing here?

569
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:25,584
Hey, your, uh, mac: and
cheese is messed up.

570
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,756
Are you guys
snooping on your kids?

571
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,132
That is not cool.

572
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,468
No, it's not snooping
if the information shows up.

573
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:35,761
That's exactly
what snooping is.

574
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:37,763
No, it's like
the Patriot Act.

575
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:38,931
Well, it's not like
the Patriot Act.

576
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:40,099
It's like snooping.

577
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:42,643
Okay. We don't know what
they're talking about, so...

578
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:43,977
What?
Okay.

579
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,271
Oh, is it like puzzles?
Ooh, I love puzzles.

580
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,523
<i>Husk saw Inferno.</i>

581
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:48,732
Yeah, great.
What are they saying?

582
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:51,527
Okay, so there's something
about an eggplant handshake.

583
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,611
Eggplant agreement.

584
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,571
Yeah. They got an agreement
to make eggplant Parmesan.

585
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,448
No, eggplants are dicks
in teenage emoji language.

586
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:57,866
What? LISA: You know
what, that's true.

587
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,661
Julie told me that the emojis have...
They all have secret meanings.

588
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:02,287
Mmm-hmm.
So, like, trees are weed

589
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:05,499
and snowflakes
are cocaine and

590
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:07,292
that thing is "yas queen."

591
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,460
<i>'(as queer“!</i>

592
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,087
What the hell is that? You've
never heard of "yas queen"?

593
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:11,296
No.
All right, grandpa.

594
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:16,093
Hold on. Julie is making some kind
of a dick-related agreement here.

595
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,220
Kayla is in on
the agreement.

596
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:19,680
No fucking way.

597
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:21,765
Okay, clown face.
What the fuck does that mean?

598
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,726
That means
she's down to clown.

599
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:27,604
- Okay.
- Three eggplants?

600
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,523
And look at the drool coming
out of that smiley face.

601
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:30,607
You wish that was drool.

602
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:31,817
That's cum, my man.
Stand down!

603
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,443
It is. Look, it's cum.
He's, like...

604
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,446
This is sex if I've ever seen
it illustrated in emoji form.

605
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:39,324
No, no, no. Maybe not. They're
best friends. They're just saying,

606
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,118
like, "You're okay with me.

607
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:43,245
"You're okay to me. You're okay to
me." You say that to your friends?

608
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:45,789
Whenever I see my friends, I go, "Hey!
You're okay with me."

609
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:47,249
I don't use these!

610
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,084
Hold on. Agreement hands,
agreement hands,

611
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:51,211
agreement hands. This is a...
It's a sex agreement.

612
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,463
They're making a sex pact.

613
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,299
They're gonna lose their
virginity on prom night.

614
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:56,884
That cannot be a sex pact.

615
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,594
That? That is friendship.

616
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,723
And that is the bond of friendship
that can never be broken.

617
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,099
I mean, maybe.
Yeah.

618
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:05,767
Oh! Just look, they wrote
"Sex Pact 2018."

619
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,520
I fucking knew it!
I love puzzles.

620
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,522
I told you guys.
Have you seen Inferno?

621
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,191
Call your kid. Leese,
have you seen Inferno?

622
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,567
Have you guys seen Inferno?

623
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:15,569
I figured it out in two seconds.
Did you see Inferno?

624
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:17,487
The guy jumps off the thing in the
beginning. He's got a virus.

625
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,114
Have you seen Inferno
with Tom Hanks?

626
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:20,282
Okay.

627
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:21,825
Okay, she's not answering her phone.
Yeah, Kayla isn't either.

628
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:23,535
Okay, what the heck
is happening?

629
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,037
She's always been
honest with me.

630
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:26,914
She's always
told me the truth,

631
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:29,541
and now I'm just swimming
in a pool of lies.

632
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,376
Okay. Here's what's
gonna happen.

633
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,004
She's gonna have sex
with that Austin kid

634
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:37,049
and then she's gonna think
that she has all these feelings,

635
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:39,218
which she does not
actually have,

636
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,720
and then she's gonna drive
across country

637
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:44,514
and follow him
and ruin her fucking life!

638
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:47,392
Okay, I think that's a pretty big leap
to make when you read a couple...

639
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,646
I have invested
every single piece of my being

640
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,648
into preparing Kayla
for success, and now this?

641
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:57,236
She is about to have sex with
some dipshit with a "man bun."

642
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,780
You're not using those
in the right way.

643
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:02,157
Hey, can we all come back
to "Planet Earth"?

644
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:03,700
'Cause this is not
a big deal.

645
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,411
They're teenage girls.
They have sex.

646
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,414
Do you freak out when you see
a bee fucking a flower?

647
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:13,752
I'm gonna stop her.

648
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:14,962
I'm in.

649
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:16,838
Let's cockblock
those motherfuckers.

650
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:18,799
Whoa...

651
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:19,883
No, sir. Uh-uh.

652
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:22,511
No, no, no, no. I promised Sam
the greatest night of her life

653
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:24,221
and if you guys fuck up
your daughters' night,

654
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:26,848
it's gonna fuck up my daughter's
night, and that shit is"not cool."

655
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,350
I don't give a fuck
what's cool with you.

656
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:29,977
Let's go, Mitchell.
I'll drive.

657
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,645
Hey! Hey, hey, wait!
No,no,no.

658
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:33,188
You wanna go?

659
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:34,815
You got to go through me.

660
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,276
Oh, Jesus. Okay,
you called my bluff. Wait.

661
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:38,777
Wait! Hey!

662
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:41,029
Get off! Get off of me!
Get off! HUNTER: Hey! Hey!

663
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,489
Not cool!

664
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:43,865
This is "not cool"!

665
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,451
Hey! What's the plan?
This is stupid.

666
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:51,164
Fuck off.

667
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:52,708
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

668
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:53,917
What the fuck are you doing?

669
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:56,712
I just need to talk to my
daughter for five minutes.

670
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:57,879
Get out of the car!

671
00:29:57,963 --> 00:29:58,964
You get out.

672
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,048
You get out!
You get out!

673
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,133
Stop saying what I'm saying!

674
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,218
Stop saying what I'm saying.
Stop saying what I'm saying!

675
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:04,594
Stop! Okay. Listen, listen.
Hey!

676
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,221
Okay, everyone calm down,
calm down.

677
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:08,307
The window!
No, the window!

678
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,475
Hey! What the fuck! No!

679
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:15,731
Damn, these are new shorts!

680
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:16,815
Truce, truce!

681
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,900
Truce, truce, truce.

682
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,778
I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry!

683
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:23,447
Oh, my fucking God!

684
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,531
Uh...

685
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:26,533
I'm sorry, man.

686
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:29,286
It's not gonna work.
You're not Schwarzenegger!

687
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:32,914
How is that possible?

688
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,875
How is that possible?
Oh, shit!

689
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:36,543
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

690
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:37,794
My balls! My balls!

691
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:39,296
Your ass is so...

692
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,425
Hey! Hey! Not cool!

693
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,385
Ah! You're bullying me!

694
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:48,388
This is bullying!
What you're doing is wrong!

695
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,059
You know your daughter's
in this stupid sex pact, too.

696
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,727
Yeah, and she's not gonna
do anything about it, okay?

697
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:55,937
Like you would know
what your daughter's gonna do.

698
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,398
Okay, first of all, ouch!

699
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:01,818
Second of all, I know nothing is
gonna happen with Sam because...

700
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,528
Because she's gay.

701
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:06,323
Really? Did she come out
to you?

702
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,950
No, of course not.
She barely speaks to me.

703
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,869
Then how do you know?
Because, bro,

704
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:13,663
I'm her dad. And there's
just some things you know.

705
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,291
Chad is nothing.
He's like a beard.

706
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:19,544
Or whatever a lesbian beard is.
A merkin?

707
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:20,712
I don't know. The point is,

708
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,923
I guarantee you
they don't even kiss, okay?

709
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,299
I'm not worried about that.

710
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:26,510
I'm worried about you two
dicks fucking up her night.

711
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,637
Okay, well, what you don't
understand is that

712
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:31,223
sex can be very confusing
for young girls,

713
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,142
and make them say things and do
things that they might regret.

714
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:35,727
Like dropping out of college

715
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,105
to follow around
the Dave Matthews Band

716
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:41,191
with a guy they think they love who
then winds up getting them pregnant

717
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:42,776
and then leaving them

718
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:47,572
for the girl who makes grilled cheese
sandwiches with hash aioli on them.

719
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:52,828
Yeah, that is
a extremely specific scenario

720
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,621
and that won't happen
to Julie.

721
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:57,541
Dave's not even touring right now.
He's taking time off for fatherhood.

722
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,292
It was me, you idiot.

723
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:01,294
Me. That happened to me.

724
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,921
Yeah.

725
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,852
You weren't ready!
Okay, one more.

726
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:17,936
Smile.

727
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:19,729
I closed my eye.

728
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:21,857
Oh, my God!

729
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,484
You guys!
This is our song!

730
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,236
Do you remember when we
got snowed in at Sam's

731
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:28,488
and we played this like
over and over? Yes!

732
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:30,615
We have to dance!
This is our jam!

733
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:45,839
Hey!
Hey!

734
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,174
Hey! I want a drink.

735
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:48,258
Okay, yeah, let's go get one.

736
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,302
No,no,no,no.
Like, a drink.

737
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:52,053
Oh, you want a drink-drink.
Yeah.

738
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,097
Okay, let me call my guy.

739
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:55,265
Hello, Mr. Drink Drink.

740
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:56,975
Let's go get fucked up!

741
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:58,143
Okay.

742
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,437
Kayla, Kayla! Ah.

743
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,158
Hey.Chad!

744
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:14,993
I'm gonna go
get, uh, some dessert.

745
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,495
Get me two!

746
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:29,424
Hey, Angelica,
it's a nice cape.

747
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:30,842
Uh, hey, Sam,

748
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,135
thank you.

749
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:40,018
Um, yeah, it's a Galadriel cape that I
made a couple months ago for LordCon.

750
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:41,228
Figured I could wear it again.

751
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:44,189
Not too much overlap
on the guest list.

752
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,567
Yeah. Totally.

753
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:51,279
Who'd you come here with?

754
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,281
Um... Just my friends.

755
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:55,951
Lauren and I broke up.

756
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,161
Oh!

757
00:33:58,245 --> 00:34:00,247
No hard feelings though.

758
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:03,375
Um, she's still
a little confused.

759
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:06,795
How do you think one becomes

760
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:10,257
not confused?

761
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:14,135
It's probably different
for everyone.

762
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:17,514
But for me, when I kissed Brad
Markowski, I started to suspect it,

763
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:21,810
and then last year when I touched Dash
Lowenstein's dick, I was like,

764
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:24,563
"Fuck no." It was like
holding a dead snake.

765
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:25,939
Hmm.

766
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:30,735
But I guess you never know
until you try.

767
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,745
Uh, before I do
drink this, though,

768
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,163
I just wanna let you know

769
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,708
that I am fully planning
on having sex tonight.

770
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,711
With... With you.

771
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,755
Yeah, I mean, wherever
the wind blows us.

772
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:52,841
Well, the Wind's gonna
blow us there.

773
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,593
Wherever the night
takes us.

774
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,053
It's gonna take your penis
into my vagina.

775
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,015
Okay. Uh... You know,
if the universe wills it.

776
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,559
And the universe
will will it.

777
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:06,813
Thanks for letting me know.
I guess.

778
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,649
Uh,yeah.

779
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,109
Oh, my God!
I warned you.

780
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:12,819
This is what gin tastes like?
No, no.

781
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:15,322
I've heard that gin sucks and this sucks.
No, it's...

782
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:18,366
I made it. Um...
Oh.

783
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:20,660
This is so dumb. Okay?

784
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:23,288
Yeah, our kids are gonna hate us
because you're gonna humiliate them.

785
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:26,124
I'm not gonna humiliate Julie.
We're best friends.

786
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:27,292
I'm the cool mom.

787
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,044
Hunter, don't make me
sit on your balls again.

788
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,379
Stop, stop, stop it,
stop, stop!

789
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:34,174
This is how they're gonna
be remembered in high school,

790
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:36,926
as the weirdos whose parents
dragged them out of prom

791
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,637
because they were afraid
of their sexuality.

792
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:41,931
It's not something that should be
feared, it should be celebrated.

793
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:46,019
And... And we have to empower
these young women.

794
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:48,647
I mean, what year
is it, guys? It's 2018.

795
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:52,067
- Jesus Christ!
- Oh, gross.

796
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,234
Okay, you know what?

797
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,736
That's an unfortunate
coincidence.

798
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:56,154
Get a fucking room!

799
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,414
Let's take a picture!

800
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,291
Kayla! Let's take a picture
right now.

801
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:10,168
Okay, cool!

802
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:11,336
Cheese!

803
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,963
Oh, my God, my mom called
me, like, 15 times.

804
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,799
She's crazy!
Nope.

805
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:16,966
No. That's a no.
That's kind of funny.

806
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:19,386
Boom! Airplane mode.
No.

807
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,846
Yeah. We're flying
the friendly skies now.

808
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,264
Yeah, until she freaks out.

809
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,724
Look, can we please
get out of here?

810
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,476
No! We can't go right now.

811
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:28,520
They haven't even played
me and Austin's song yet.

812
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:29,688
How are we gonna
get in the mood?

813
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:31,189
I don't know,
light your Walgreens candle.

814
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,315
That's later.

815
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:35,068
Don't you want... Look, look.
Jake Donahue is just warming up.

816
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:38,446
Don't you wanna see him breakdance
and probably hurt himself?

817
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,073
- No. I don't.
- It's gonna be so good.

818
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,659
Do you remember
at the Sadie Hawkins Dance

819
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:45,787
when he tried to do the worm and he
fell and broke his two front teeth?

820
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:47,122
Yeah, he had to go to the hospital.
I have pictures.

821
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,582
It was great.
And this is gonna be better!

822
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:50,667
No,no,no.
So we're staying.

823
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,961
No! Julie, Julie. I promise

824
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:55,130
that you're gonna dance to your
song with your boyfriend tonight.

825
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,965
This place is dying, okay?

826
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:58,466
We gotta get out of here.

827
00:36:58,633 --> 00:36:59,634
Okay, fine.

828
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:01,886
Okay, cool, let's go.

829
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:04,013
We're going
to the lake house!

830
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,307
I'm not sure
that this was worth $85.

831
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:07,976
Where's Chad?

832
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,060
What?

833
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:10,812
Oh, he's probably
out on the dance floor.

834
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:12,647
I'm gonna go find him
and meet you guys outside.

835
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:13,815
All right.

836
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:30,915
The fuck?

837
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,588
Smirking little piece of shit.

838
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:38,548
Top knot. Top knot.
Let's get him.

839
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:40,467
Yeah, you guys go do that.

840
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,594
I'm gonna get some punch.

841
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,346
All right, asshole, what'd
you do with my daughter?

842
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,349
Two of you guys have the same
shitty haircut? Hey!

843
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,435
Look at me.
My hair's too long.

844
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:54,314
Hey! You can't go around
assaulting children.

845
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:55,815
You have to blend in

846
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:58,109
if you want
some information, okay?

847
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:01,988
So just... Just be cool. God!

848
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:03,364
Okay.

849
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,533
Julie?

850
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:07,702
Julie?

851
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:15,960
Prom night, huh?

852
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:17,670
What?

853
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:21,007
Just special night.

854
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:28,681
Gotta try.

855
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:36,189
Chad?
Yeah?

856
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,043
This is my moment.

857
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,728
You ruined my moment!

858
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,021
Fuck your moment.

859
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:19,399
What happened
back there?

860
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:22,735
What happened is that my daughter was
kissing Chad even though she hated it...

861
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,655
And I've been dragged in this
situation by you two fucking idiots!

862
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:26,823
Just ignore him.
Great idea.

863
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:27,949
We're gonna go
to Austin's house.

864
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,826
Julie said that's where the after-party
is and we'll get 'em there.

865
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:30,994
And that sounds
like a plan.

866
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,787
Hey, how dare you ignore me.

867
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:35,373
We are in this situation because
you two raised a couple of bigots

868
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,543
who have shamed my daughter into
losing her virginity to the wrong sex.

869
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,003
Shame!

870
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:43,131
My daughter is not a bigot.

871
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,842
We go to all of the marches.

872
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:49,178
We went to the Tax Day March
and nobody goes to that shit.

873
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:50,847
Nobody!
Ignore him.

874
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:52,348
It's hard.
Yeah, it is hard.

875
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,516
'Cause I don't quit.

876
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:54,976
And now I have
to go rescue Sam

877
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:57,145
because she is scared
and confused

878
00:39:57,312 --> 00:40:00,565
and I know what it's like to be ostracized
by society for your sexual preferences.

879
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:04,152
Sleeping with women that aren't your
wife isn't a sexual preference.

880
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,487
No, it is! I prefer them.

881
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:08,323
How parents can let their kids

882
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,616
play music this loud?

883
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:11,951
We all share this planet.

884
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,786
This is how loud
I listen to my music, dawg.

885
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,914
Probably won't even be
able to hear us.

886
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,541
It's so dark in there.

887
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:22,045
They could be in the backyard playing
two-on-two hoops. I don't know.

888
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:24,339
Oh. I found a big window.

889
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:26,507
No, no, don't,
don't, don't.

890
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:29,302
Trust me. Do not look
in that window.

891
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:30,845
What? Look at me.
Do not look in this window.

892
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,013
Do not look
in this fucking window!

893
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,893
Julie's red dress!
Shit!

894
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,813
Shit! Oh, God.

895
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:44,692
I know this must be
tough for you.

896
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:45,985
I mean, if...

897
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,237
Hell, if that was Kayla
in there, I'd...

898
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:50,990
I'd kill myself.
Nope.

899
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:53,159
That's the wrong thing
to fucking say right now.

900
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:55,244
Stop them. Stop it!

901
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:56,412
I can't... Wait.

902
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,415
Hey! It's not Julie.

903
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:00,500
It's not Julie.

904
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,669
What?

905
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:04,963
Shit!
It's Austin's parents.

906
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,255
Good for them.

907
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:07,465
Really going at it.

908
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:10,343
Always wanted to do this. I've always
wanted to watch people have sex.

909
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,220
Oh, my God,
he's yanking her hair.

910
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,805
Ow. That looks like it hurts.

911
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,932
Yeah, we shouldn't
be looking, man. Come on.

912
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:18,142
She runs the risk
of, like, dislocating her hip.

913
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,936
Hey, Mitchell. You're being
a fucking perv, dude.

914
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:21,688
Don't look.

915
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:29,112
What happened?

916
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:31,280
We locked eyes
and then he finished.

917
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,700
That means his load
is on your soul for eternity.

918
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:34,826
Holy shit!

919
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:35,910
Oh, shit, he's coming.

920
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,871
I'll pretend I'm a plant.

921
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,751
Mitchell?
What are you doing?

922
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,503
Lisa?
Hey,Ron!

923
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:47,463
What are you guys
doing out here?

924
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,631
Hi!

925
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:50,800
Hey!
What a nice surprise!

926
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:53,469
We thought the kids were here. We
didn't realize you guys were here.

927
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:57,265
Oh, Cath and I were just having
a little prom night role-play.

928
00:41:57,432 --> 00:41:59,767
You know, to keep the sex life alive.
Prom night!

929
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:02,270
Where are the kids? Um, do you
know where the kids are'?

930
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:05,106
The kids are at
Kyler Montero's lake house.

931
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,190
How do you know that?

932
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:07,984
Because Austin told us.
Yeah.

933
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,195
He's texted me, like,
19 times tonight.

934
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,322
Ugh. Oh, my God. Yeah, we
tell each other everything.

935
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:14,574
It's unbelievable.

936
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:15,742
He knows about prom night.

937
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,326
Well, you know.
I'm sorry, you...

938
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,954
You tell your son about your
sex games with your wife?

939
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:21,122
Uh-huh. Yeah.

940
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:24,292
Can't do that. There's a line.
Yeah, it's weird.

941
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,376
It's... It's weird.

942
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:27,378
We have a very
open family here.

943
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,005
Yes, we do.
We don't hide anything.

944
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:30,423
You know what,
what is Kyler's address?

945
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:35,136
Okay, listen, I feel like I
can't betray Austin's confidence in me

946
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:38,806
and frankly if Julie wanted to
tell you where the house was,

947
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:39,974
she would've told you.

948
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:42,351
Uh-uh.
I got...Hold on, hold on.
Buh,buh,buh.

949
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:43,853
Give us the address.

950
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:45,980
Or my giant friend's gonna tear
your husband's dick off.

951
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:47,148
Yeah.

952
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,232
No, I'm not.

953
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:49,317
No, I'm not.
Excuse me?

954
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:52,195
No, no, no. That's...
That's good.

955
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,155
And, uh, sorry to interrupt
your evening.

956
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:56,449
I hope you guys enjoy
the rest of your love-making.

957
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,034
- Ah, fuck!
- Come on, man.

958
00:42:58,159 --> 00:42:59,160
- What was that about?
- What?

959
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,037
Hey, man, thank you for
killing my daughter's hymen.

960
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:03,081
I don't think so.
Kyler Montero's lake house?

961
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,248
Marcie did the bathroom.

962
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,876
She's gonna know the address.
So let's just go.

963
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:08,669
All right, dope.
Dope.

964
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,298
Oh, my eyes!
Yeah!

965
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:14,509
Okay, come on in now.

966
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,844
It's all fun and games
until there's a decapitation.

967
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:19,305
I don't need any more
dead girls on my conscience.

968
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:20,681
I'm sorry, Rudy!

969
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:24,102
We just had to check that off
the old prom bucket list.

970
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,521
Oh, my God! Sam!

971
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:27,897
Come here. Yeah!
Move, Chad!

972
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:30,066
Chad, you want a drink?
No.

973
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:31,943
What you got there?

974
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:35,655
This is a very, very special reduced
hash oil of my own invention.

975
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:37,990
It has rosemary essence
for blood flow,

976
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:41,244
a curcumin extract from turmeric
to reduce inflammation.

977
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,412
And it gets you super baked.

978
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:47,500
All right! Let's do it.
Do I just suck'?

979
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:49,836
Yeah, you press the button and
you take, like, a little puff.

980
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:53,965
Or a really, really
big one. Okay.

981
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:56,384
And then you just hold it
for, like, a beat.

982
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:59,137
You guys know that Tanner Dunn's
parents rented out a whole floor

983
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,389
of the Park West Hotel
for an after-party?

984
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:02,723
What?

985
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:04,892
Um... Yeah...
He, uh...

986
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,061
I guess they're super loaded and
they're still proud of him,

987
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:09,188
even though it took him, like,
six years to graduate.

988
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:12,817
I remember him. He got to miss
school when his kid was born.

989
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:13,985
Yeah, that guy.

990
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:15,820
You should definitely
let it go now.

991
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:20,324
Holy shit.

992
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:24,453
Oh, yeah. I can run a six-minute mile.
My lung capacity is legit.

993
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,455
No!
One more selfie.

994
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:27,999
And this time let's pose
like Kanye.

995
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:29,292
No!Boo!

996
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,377
Yes.
You take too many pictures.

997
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,504
They don't look like him.

998
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,549
It's just a bunch of
paint samples and swatches.

999
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:38,134
Hunter! Quiet!

1000
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:39,343
Why do I have to be quiet?

1001
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,429
Shit would not fly
if Marcie found out.

1002
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:42,722
Who wears the pants
in this house, dawg?

1003
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:43,890
- I do.
- Oh!

1004
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:49,228
Mmm.

1005
00:44:49,312 --> 00:44:52,940
This is soy creamer, are you sure?
It's pretty freaking rich.

1006
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,150
This is so messed up.

1007
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:56,986
Who are you to get involved
in our daughter's sex life?

1008
00:44:57,153 --> 00:44:59,238
Honey, I was just trying...
No, don't "honey" me.

1009
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:01,782
Did your dad try to stop you
when you lost your virginity?

1010
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:02,950
That's totally different.

1011
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:04,660
It is not different.
It's a double standard.

1012
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:07,872
Oh, when a guy loses his virginity,
it's no big deal, it's celebrated,

1013
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:10,625
but if a girl does, it's some
sort of big loss of innocence?

1014
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,251
- Yes!
- But come on, you guys,

1015
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:13,628
it's the same damn thing.

1016
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:17,590
Marcie!
Stop talking.

1017
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:20,551
Just give us the address.
Just give us the address.

1018
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:23,679
Honestly, Lisa, I can't
believe you're on their side.

1019
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:27,141
"Side"? This is not
some philosophical debate.

1020
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:30,561
We're trying to stop our daughters
from some kind of sex pact

1021
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:33,522
that they've planned and not
thought through all the way.

1022
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:34,774
That is such bullshit.

1023
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:36,567
How do you expect society

1024
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:39,278
to treat women as if they're equal
when their own parents won't?

1025
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:41,280
I don't know about that.

1026
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:44,700
I'll deal with society tomorrow. Right
now I'm thinking about my daughter.

1027
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:47,328
Well, that's convenient.
Yeah. You know what?

1028
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:48,746
Go ahead
and be part of the group

1029
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:52,375
that perceives women as little damsels
in distress that need saving.

1030
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,168
Who cares about us
not getting paid as much

1031
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:56,504
or not having control
of our own bodies?

1032
00:45:56,671 --> 00:46:00,174
Can you please not talk to me like I'm
someone who bombs abortion olinios?

1033
00:46:00,341 --> 00:46:02,343
I think we're a little off-topic.
We need the address.

1034
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:03,552
I just can't believe

1035
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:06,931
that you think Julie shouldn't
be free to explore her sexuality

1036
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:08,724
in the same way
that boys are.

1037
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:12,228
Girls and boys
are very different.

1038
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:14,605
Guys will take
whatever's in front of them.

1039
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:17,066
We have these
feelings and then

1040
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:21,362
your parents won't
let you see the man.

1041
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:23,614
And then he just writes
a lot of letters

1042
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:26,993
but you don't get them because
your mom doesn't give them to you

1043
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:29,620
and then it starts raining
really hard

1044
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,831
because he built
a house for you.

1045
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,626
And then, it's...

1046
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:37,378
Mitchell, did you get
the address?

1047
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:38,462
- Yup!
- What?

1048
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:39,547
I'm really sorry.
I'll call you tomorrow.

1049
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:41,424
I'm just really stressed out.
It was so good to see you.

1050
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,175
<i>Was that The Notebook?</i>

1051
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:45,970
Fucking fuck off, Hunter!
God damn it! Mitchell!

1052
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:47,763
I love you, I'm doing this
for our daughter, I'll be home late!

1053
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,015
Shit!

1054
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,936
To the loss of our innocence.

1055
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,646
Whoo!

1056
00:46:58,649 --> 00:46:59,650
Oh!

1057
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,360
Come on!

1058
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:04,113
You guys!
This is the best night!

1059
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,116
lam so drunk, super high

1060
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:10,911
and Connor has a little
something-something that I feel

1061
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:12,163
I need to go check out.

1062
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,582
All right.
It's fuck o'clock.

1063
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:16,542
- No way. You, too?
- Yep.

1064
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:20,796
These are macarons...
Ooh!

1065
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,175
With a very special concoction
of mine that I call Wavy Davy.

1066
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:27,011
So it's DMT that I get
from the dark web.

1067
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:29,096
And then there's
a little tiny bit of Xanax

1068
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,807
to just kind of take the edge
off, you know. It's pretty tight.

1069
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:33,559
Sounds pretty tight.

1070
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:35,269
And then I bake it
into a white chocolate macaron

1071
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:37,063
andithas,Hke,
a raspberry filling

1072
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:40,983
that's both light and fluffy but
also very flavorful and satisfying.

1073
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:42,943
Are you ready?

1074
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:45,154
Uh, yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, let's do it.

1075
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:47,823
Okay. Let's go.

1076
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:51,160
Mmm.

1077
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:52,703
It's yum.

1078
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:53,829
Mmm.

1079
00:47:58,417 --> 00:47:59,710
So what do we do?
We just walk in

1080
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:01,420
and flick the lights on and
off until the kids come?

1081
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:04,465
Just act cool and young,
and maybe we'll just slip in.

1082
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:05,883
Mitchell, untuck your shirt.

1083
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:07,968
No, it's not that kind of shirt.
It looks stupid untucked.

1084
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,221
Untuok your shirt. You look
like a youth minister.

1085
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:11,722
Untuck your fucking shirt, man.
We're trying to look cool.

1086
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:12,890
All right!

1087
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:14,934
Whoa. Oh, Sorry, bro!
Sorry, guys.

1088
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:17,019
Sorry. My friend's wasted.

1089
00:48:17,353 --> 00:48:18,354
Don't.

1090
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:21,148
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey! No
adults are getting into my house.

1091
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,858
Not on prom night.
Okay, not on prom.

1092
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:25,778
We were just down the street
at another party

1093
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:28,030
and then we just decided
to come up here

1094
00:48:28,197 --> 00:48:30,157
and hang with you guys. Uh...

1095
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:31,242
No parents here, right?

1096
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:32,368
Ah, thank God!

1097
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:33,494
No, not except
for you guys. No.

1098
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:35,788
We're not... We don't...

1099
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:36,872
Yeah, no.

1100
00:48:36,956 --> 00:48:37,957
Okay, so you're cops.

1101
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:43,295
I got two DUls last year.
How could I be a cop?

1102
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:44,672
The police?

1103
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:46,173
Look at my untucked shirt.

1104
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,676
You're literally the cop-lest
motherfucker I've ever seen.

1105
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:51,429
You look like you got your hair
out in the baok of a squad oar.

1106
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:54,807
- This is a regular men's haircut.
- Okay.

1107
00:48:54,974 --> 00:48:56,350
This is ridiculous.

1108
00:48:56,517 --> 00:48:58,310
All right, you're minors,
we're minors.

1109
00:48:58,477 --> 00:48:59,812
You're, like, 45 years old.

1110
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:01,564
Fuck you. I was born in '77.

1111
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:02,690
'87.

1112
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:03,774
'94.

1113
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:06,026
We're gonna drink
with you guys.

1114
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,988
Would cops drink
with underage kids? No.

1115
00:49:09,155 --> 00:49:11,073
Okay. What about
a little chugging contest?

1116
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:12,450
Um...

1117
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:15,202
Yeah. Bring it.

1118
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:17,455
Okay, wait.

1119
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:18,789
I gotta get the room ready.

1120
00:49:22,835 --> 00:49:23,961
Oh, wow!

1121
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:27,173
You're really going for it,
aren't ya?

1122
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:30,634
I saw this in the romantic comedy,
American Beauty. So good.

1123
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:33,345
You watched the whole thing?

1124
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:39,560
You know what
this candle does to me.

1125
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:40,853
Is that the one
that gives you hives?

1126
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:42,730
No, it's the good one.
Oh, nice.

1127
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:48,235
You look so hot right now.

1128
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:00,372
Where are my chuggers at?
You ready?

1129
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:02,625
Oh, right here. Let's go!
What, what!

1130
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:03,959
KYLERI All right.

1131
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:05,044
COOI.

1132
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:06,128
Drop 'em.

1133
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:07,213
Let's do it.

1134
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:10,424
Wait, what?

1135
00:50:10,591 --> 00:50:12,426
Guys?
We're lust chugging, right?

1136
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:13,677
Yeah, we're butt-chugging.

1137
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,930
Yeah, you put the tube up your
butt and you funnel the beer in.

1138
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:18,516
It fucks you up way more,
man, trust me.

1139
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,100
Guys, butt-chugging?
You got this. You got it.

1140
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:21,519
No, I'm tagging out.
You're in.

1141
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:22,937
What? Why me?

1142
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,355
You've had a baby. Everything's
looser down there.

1143
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:27,525
I didn't have a baby out of my butt.
Even I know that.

1144
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:28,692
Mitchell.

1145
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:31,820
Okay, this isn't a common
occurrence with me,

1146
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:34,573
but I have had things
up there before.

1147
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,575
Hmm?
It's just all about breathing.

1148
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:39,995
So just breathe through it,
and accept it in.

1149
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:41,539
I can't do it.
I can't do it.

1150
00:50:41,664 --> 00:50:43,582
Hey! She's up there right now
with that dick-bag, Connor,

1151
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,376
with his man bun
and that stupid smirk.

1152
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:47,002
Think about this.

1153
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:50,047
Wait. Connor?

1154
00:50:50,214 --> 00:50:52,424
You know... You know
Connor Aldrich, The Chef?

1155
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,510
Why do they call him
"The Chef"?

1156
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:57,012
Oh. Maybe a big fan
of <i>South Park?</i>

1157
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,180
"Hello, children."

1158
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:00,307
No. No. He cooks drugs
into everything.

1159
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:04,228
Everything! One time he made me
this, like, acid financier cake.

1160
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:06,897
Oh! That shit
was to die for, man!

1161
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:08,899
Like, literally,
I almost fucking died.

1162
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,985
Yeah. Dude, if your daughter
had anything like that cake,

1163
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:12,653
she might not remember
who you are tomorrow.

1164
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,156
Give me the fucking tube.

1165
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:19,410
Let's bone.

1166
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:20,494
Wait, what?

1167
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:23,539
Oh! Are you sure that this
is how you wanna do it?

1168
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,711
Yes, Chad. This is always
how I've imagined it.

1169
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:31,171
Oh, you know, I'd rather leave
my shirt on, if that's sexier.

1170
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:34,091
I need another drink.

1171
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:35,467
Wait, wait, uh...

1172
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,555
Can you lube it up
with something first?

1173
00:51:39,722 --> 00:51:41,056
Yeah, I'll just spit on it.
No!

1174
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:43,392
Why? Because I'm a man?
Get over yourself.

1175
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:46,645
No, 'cause you're fucking gross
and your fucking saliva's gross.

1176
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:48,689
I have lip gloss.
We got lip gloss.

1177
00:51:48,856 --> 00:51:50,024
Okay, fine. Shit.

1178
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,233
I don't have lip gloss.

1179
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,901
All right, guys,
let's get those tubes in.

1180
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:54,236
All right, I got the lip
gloss on there. Okay.

1181
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:56,196
Okay, okay. All right.

1182
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,364
Okay, ready?

1183
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:58,949
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

1184
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:00,117
- It's not in yet.
- Okay.

1185
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:02,286
Chill. LISA: It's just
gonna be on the count of three.

1186
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:03,829
You got this, dawg.
This is for your kid.

1187
00:52:03,996 --> 00:52:04,997
On three, okay. All right.

1188
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,081
On three.
Yeah.

1189
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:07,458
- Okay, one...
- One.

1190
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:10,461
Are you okay?

1191
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:11,545
Okay, get your 40s.

1192
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:12,921
They got a lager or an IPA.

1193
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:14,214
It doesn't matter.
Doesn't matter.

1194
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:15,382
Okay.

1195
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:16,675
I don't know about this.
No,no,no,no.

1196
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:17,843
It's too late.
It's already in.

1197
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:19,094
Here you go. It's in you.
It's part of you now.

1198
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,262
Ready?
Yeah.

1199
00:52:20,346 --> 00:52:21,555
Set...

1200
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:22,973
Chug!

1201
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,516
Butt chug! Butt chug!

1202
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:26,310
Butt chug! Butt chug!

1203
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:27,561
Wait.

1204
00:52:27,728 --> 00:52:29,396
- Hey, hey!
- Loosen up!

1205
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,190
It's not working, dude.
I can't!

1206
00:52:31,357 --> 00:52:33,108
You can hold my hand!
Okay.

1207
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:35,903
- Ow!
- You're hurting her.

1208
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:36,987
God! It really hurt!
I'm sorry!

1209
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:40,699
Channel that energy
into your butt hole.

1210
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:42,242
This changes
everything I know!

1211
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:45,245
Dude, if your daughter could
see you now she'd be so proud of you.

1212
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,248
Whoa...

1213
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:52,586
lam...
lam tripping so hard.

1214
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:54,213
It's not working.
It's not working, dude.

1215
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:56,423
- Oh, it's terrible.
- It is.

1216
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:58,550
Open up!

1217
00:52:58,634 --> 00:53:00,386
I'm sorry.
I can't do it, man.

1218
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:01,887
Focus! For your daughter.

1219
00:53:02,054 --> 00:53:03,555
Fuck, Mitch. Focus.

1220
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:04,807
You gotta breathe.
You gotta open up, dude.

1221
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:07,142
Relax!
I'm relaxed! I'm dilated.

1222
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:09,728
I'm staring at your asshole.
You're not dilating.

1223
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:13,440
Mitchell, you're gonna
lose to this punk bitch?

1224
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,484
Breathe. Take it in!

1225
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,030
There we go.

1226
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:21,532
Okay, good.
Oh!

1227
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:23,283
It's working!
It's working! Holy shit!

1228
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,743
Holy shit!
It's working!

1229
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,578
We're almost halfway done.

1230
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:28,956
Pos! Fucking run!

1231
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:30,332
Cops?

1232
00:53:30,499 --> 00:53:31,667
What? Oh, no!

1233
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:36,839
Ass beer!

1234
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:40,008
Lisa, the foam went into my mouth!
I have to go to the hospital!

1235
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:42,010
Hurry up!
Get out of here!

1236
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:44,012
Shit!

1237
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:45,723
We gotta go.

1238
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,808
I got ass beer,
I should go to the hospital.

1239
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:50,477
Shit!
The fucking cops?

1240
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,229
The fucking cops are here?
Wait, wait, wait.

1241
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:54,189
I can't get the tube out.
Pull the tube out.

1242
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:56,108
Leese, pull it out.
No! I put it in!

1243
00:53:56,275 --> 00:53:58,026
I had to spit on it!
What? You spit on it?

1244
00:53:58,152 --> 00:53:59,153
No, it was my lip gloss.
What the fuck?

1245
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:00,320
It was lip gloss.
Pull it out!

1246
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:02,072
Hey, man, be gentle.
Be fucking gentle, all right?

1247
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,615
I'm gonna be gentle,
all right? Ready?

1248
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:04,950
All right, on three.
On three...

1249
00:54:05,117 --> 00:54:06,118
One.
Ow!

1250
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:11,039
Come on.

1251
00:54:11,123 --> 00:54:12,791
Hey, guys!

1252
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:13,876
Guys!

1253
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:15,294
Wait, wait. Sam.

1254
00:54:15,461 --> 00:54:16,462
Sam!

1255
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:18,464
Sam, Sam! We're over here.

1256
00:54:18,547 --> 00:54:19,548
No!

1257
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:20,632
No. No.

1258
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:22,259
The night is over.
No.

1259
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:24,636
It's over. It's done.

1260
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,513
The night is not over.

1261
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:28,640
The night has just begun.

1262
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:35,355
Jesus, Chad, use your legs.

1263
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:37,691
I mean, I pretty much carried
her, like, the whole way there.

1264
00:54:46,575 --> 00:54:48,577
Hustle, hustle, hustle!

1265
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:50,788
Come on, Sam.

1266
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,122
Come with us!
I can't.

1267
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,332
My car is here.

1268
00:54:53,499 --> 00:54:56,001
But all my friends
are going to the hotel party.

1269
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:57,419
Maybe I'll see you later.

1270
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:04,635
- Get in the car. Go, go, go, girl!
- Sam!

1271
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:06,804
You'll see her later!
Seriously, hurry up!

1272
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:07,888
What are you doing?

1273
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:09,723
Whoo, this night is not over,
I swear to Christ!

1274
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:11,308
<i>Dukes of Hazzard!</i>

1275
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,603
Racist-ass show anyway.

1276
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:15,771
I got the spins, man.

1277
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:16,980
We gotta find
our daughter, dawg.

1278
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:18,190
I'm gonna sit down
for a second.

1279
00:55:18,357 --> 00:55:19,441
Rudy! It's Rudy.

1280
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,401
Rudy, Rudy,
wait, wait!

1281
00:55:21,527 --> 00:55:23,654
There he goes! Hit
the clicker, open the door!

1282
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:25,989
L got mine.

1283
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:27,115
Seatbelts!

1284
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:28,325
You'll get a big ticket.

1285
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:32,704
That's them
right there.

1286
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:34,122
They're getting away.
You gotta go faster.

1287
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:36,750
Okay.
Hey, you gotta be in it 110%.

1288
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:38,377
Okay.
You gotta be in it to win it!

1289
00:55:38,544 --> 00:55:40,254
How do you get more competitive
when you're drunk?

1290
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:43,298
Hey, man. I'm more of a winner
when I'm drunk, all right?

1291
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:46,051
And the question
that I have for you, Leese...

1292
00:55:46,218 --> 00:55:48,637
Are you a winner?
Are you in it to win it?

1293
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:50,722
Winning is my bitch!
All right!

1294
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,182
Strong.
Knock,knock!

1295
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:53,267
Who's there?

1296
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,227
Me winning.

1297
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:58,647
It's not...

1298
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:00,482
It's not that good.

1299
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:04,403
Ow. Ow!
Lisa winning!

1300
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:06,071
It's not that good!

1301
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:09,116
Ow! Fuck! All right, it's good.
It's fine. I like it.

1302
00:56:09,283 --> 00:56:10,492
Hey, you're losing him.
Let's go.

1303
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:15,163
Oh. Not on my watch.

1304
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,880
Y'all think you gonna outrun Rudy
the main motherfucking man Glover?

1305
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,047
Hell, no.

1306
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:25,591
Are you all right?
No.

1307
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:26,842
Come on.

1308
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,512
Hey, guys.

1309
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:32,723
Hey, I don't...

1310
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:35,517
I don't feel so...

1311
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:36,643
Oh, my God!

1312
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:39,021
Oh, my God!

1313
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,194
All right,
here's what we're gonna do.

1314
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:49,364
Lisa, I have seen every single
<i>Fast</i> and the Furious movie, okay?

1315
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:51,825
All of them, dozens of times.
Have you seen any of them?

1316
00:56:51,992 --> 00:56:54,953
I saw the Tokyo one, and I saw the one
where The Rock punches the torpedo.

1317
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,371
Those are the best two to see.

1318
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:59,708
Okay, in times like this,
I ask myself one question.

1319
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:02,294
"W-W-V-D-D." You know
what that means?

1320
00:57:02,461 --> 00:57:03,629
"What would Vin Diesel do?"

1321
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:05,255
Holy shit!

1322
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:06,924
No one's ever fucking
gotten that before. Okay.

1323
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,931
Oh, man, it smells like...

1324
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:16,975
What we're gonna do,
we're gonna kiss the bumper.

1325
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:19,645
You give it a little tap, and
then they're gonna spin and stop

1326
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:21,188
and we're gonna spin
and stop the other way

1327
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:23,190
and we're gonna look at each
other, and we're gonna go,

1328
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:24,775
"lt's all about
the family."

1329
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:27,235
Wait. I don't feel comfortable
running the kids off the road.

1330
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:31,239
This slow and un-furious attitude is
not helping us. You have to believe!

1331
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:32,532
Okay. I'm gonna kiss it.

1332
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:34,201
Here we go!

1333
00:57:35,661 --> 00:57:37,496
What's that?
Did <i>I</i> do it?

1334
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:40,248
No, you didn't even kiss it.
You gotta kiss it.

1335
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:42,542
Kiss it for the family!

1336
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:44,711
ls that Sam?

1337
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:48,507
She barfed on us!

1338
00:57:48,674 --> 00:57:50,300
Oh, my God!

1339
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:07,859
Okay.

1340
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,736
Are we in heaven?

1341
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:11,780
Okay. Listen, I know
how to do this.

1342
00:58:11,947 --> 00:58:14,157
Everyone lean backwards.

1343
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:17,703
If we all lean backwards on three,
the car will roll back. Ready?

1344
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,204
Okay.
One,

1345
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:21,665
two, three.

1346
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:26,294
Oh, fuck!

1347
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:28,672
Ahhh!

1348
00:58:32,384 --> 00:58:35,846
Well, that's the last
of the ass beer.

1349
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:37,889
Jesus! That's it.

1350
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:39,599
Are you okay?
Are you bleeding?

1351
00:58:39,683 --> 00:58:41,101
You might have
internal blood injuries.

1352
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:42,352
I'm all right, I'm all right.

1353
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:43,478
Here's the problem.

1354
00:58:43,562 --> 00:58:46,148
<i>The Fast and The Furious
movies are not realistic.</i>

1355
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:48,483
Where are we? Shit!

1356
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:50,485
Fuck!

1357
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:53,321
What are you doing?

1358
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:55,907
I heard that in times of crisis,
parents have superhuman strength.

1359
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:58,243
No offense, there's no scientific way
you're gonna flip that car over.

1360
00:58:58,410 --> 00:58:59,411
I couldn't even do that.

1361
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:00,495
Yeah, I couldn't do it,
either.

1362
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:03,415
Do not tell me what I can and can't do.

1363
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:09,046
Kayla's not answering again.

1364
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,213
God damn it!
We lost 'em, guys.

1365
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,841
We are fucked! Or maybe not.

1366
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:18,055
What are you doing?

1367
00:59:18,138 --> 00:59:19,973
Trying to telepathically
communicate with Kayla.

1368
00:59:20,432 --> 00:59:21,558
I'm with the X-Men of parents.

1369
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:22,893
You know what
my secret power is?

1370
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:26,396
I'm super fucking annoyed right
now and I hurt my love handle.

1371
00:59:32,194 --> 00:59:33,195
All right.

1372
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:35,822
You guys think my new clothes
go with my fedora?

1373
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,991
I'm just kidding, I know they do.

1374
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:44,498
Hey.

1375
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:48,168
Have you talked
to your mom?

1376
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:49,294
No.

1377
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:51,046
So my parents
were just texting me

1378
00:59:51,213 --> 00:59:53,924
and they were having sex and your
mom showed up looking for you.

1379
00:59:55,884 --> 00:59:57,260
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

1380
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:59,971
It's okay. They have sex all the time.

1381
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:03,391
Oh, my God,
she... The texts.

1382
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,185
So many texts.

1383
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:06,895
She's mad.

1384
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:09,064
I need to handle this.

1385
01:00:09,231 --> 01:00:10,690
Good news.
A Lyft is on its way.

1386
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:12,692
Oh, wait, no,
I know this guy. He sucks.

1387
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:14,319
Oh, shit. It's Julie.

1388
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:16,113
Be cool. Be cool.
Be cool. Be cool.

1389
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:17,280
Be quiet. Okay.

1390
01:00:17,364 --> 01:00:18,490
Hey, <i>Mom!</i>

1391
01:00:18,657 --> 01:00:19,658
I just got all your texts

1392
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:21,409
and I just wanted to let you
know that we're all good.

1393
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:22,786
<i>Cool. Cool. Okay.</i>

1394
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,997
Um... Are you at the prom?

1395
01:00:26,248 --> 01:00:29,584
Yeah. Yeah, just nonstop
magical moments.

1396
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:31,086
<i>Huh. You are lying to me.</i>

1397
01:00:31,253 --> 01:00:32,712
Where are you right now?
Where are you?

1398
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:33,922
Why are you freaking out?

1399
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:37,551
I'm freaking out because I
know what you're up to.

1400
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:39,010
And I know that
you and your friends

1401
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:43,014
are planning some kind of
little sex pact or whatever.

1402
01:00:43,098 --> 01:00:44,099
<i>What did you say?</i>

1403
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:45,183
You heard me.

1404
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,811
How could you possibly know?

1405
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:50,689
Because I am your mother
and I know you.

1406
01:00:50,856 --> 01:00:53,441
And I know you
better than you know yourself.

1407
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:57,904
And I also know that you're
planning on going to UCLA

1408
01:00:58,071 --> 01:01:00,282
<i>and that
you're following Austin.</i>

1409
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:01,741
Yeah.

1410
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:06,413
I know everything.

1411
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:11,001
Oh, my God,
you know nothing!

1412
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:13,587
Why do you even assume
that it's me following Austin?

1413
01:01:13,712 --> 01:01:17,174
Huh? You're not worried
about me, Mom.

1414
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,633
You're worried about you.

1415
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,303
You're afraid of losing me.
You're afraid of being alone.

1416
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:25,182
lam not scared of being alone.

1417
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:27,017
<i>This is not about me.</i>

1418
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:31,605
I have not thought about
myself for the last 18 years.

1419
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:33,148
This is about you.

1420
01:01:33,315 --> 01:01:35,066
And as a single mother,

1421
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:39,154
lam trying to stop you from
making a life-ruining decision.

1422
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:42,949
So I was
"a life-ruining decision"?

1423
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:44,117
No. No!

1424
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:45,911
No, that is not
what I meant.

1425
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:47,120
No, that is not
what I meant.

1426
01:01:47,204 --> 01:01:48,538
You know what, Mom?

1427
01:01:48,622 --> 01:01:51,249
I'm not going to UCLA
because of some boy, okay?

1428
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:55,462
I'm going to UCLA because it's
the furthest I can get from you.

1429
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,757
Well...

1430
01:01:58,924 --> 01:02:00,342
Hello?

1431
01:02:02,344 --> 01:02:04,846
Nanaru is on his way.

1432
01:02:05,013 --> 01:02:06,139
Forty-six minutes.

1433
01:02:08,016 --> 01:02:09,267
Well...

1434
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,478
So, she hates me.

1435
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:15,607
She doesn't hate you.

1436
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:19,444
Kayla's ignoring me. She's bringing
it to a whole new level of spite.

1437
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:21,112
Yeah.

1438
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:22,864
That's a new level of pain.

1439
01:02:23,031 --> 01:02:24,866
Yeah. I know.

1440
01:02:25,033 --> 01:02:28,370
It's just different for me
because I gave birth to her

1441
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:30,247
and I just feel
very connected.

1442
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:31,957
She was living in my body.

1443
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:33,416
Kayla grew in me.

1444
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:34,876
She grew in me. She did.

1445
01:02:35,043 --> 01:02:37,671
She grew from my balls
and I shot her into Marcie.

1446
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:40,131
This is the same
for you and me.

1447
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:42,759
Not exactly.

1448
01:02:42,926 --> 01:02:45,679
I mean, you have daily love
in your life

1449
01:02:45,845 --> 01:02:48,848
and I'm probably
gonna die alone

1450
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:51,351
and won't be found
for a really long time.

1451
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:54,104
Until one day, someone
will be walking by

1452
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:55,647
with their golden retriever,

1453
01:02:55,814 --> 01:02:57,691
and the dog is just
gonna lose its shit.

1454
01:02:57,857 --> 01:02:59,109
And then they're gonna
call the police

1455
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:03,321
and then they're gonna come in
and find me draped over the tub

1456
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:07,284
with my feral cats
eating away at my hair.

1457
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:08,660
'Cause cats do that.

1458
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:12,163
The fuck is wrong with you?
That is some dark shit!

1459
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:13,540
You're gonna die alone?

1460
01:03:13,707 --> 01:03:16,626
Whoa, whoa. My man! Come on! Where
the hell did you get that idea?

1461
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,044
I call you all the time.

1462
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:19,754
You ever return my calls? No.

1463
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:21,756
Because we're not really
friends, you and me.

1464
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:23,300
We're not friends?

1465
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:24,926
I don't mean it at that...

1466
01:03:25,385 --> 01:03:26,720
You know what you are?

1467
01:03:26,886 --> 01:03:30,390
You are like the thing
that pops up on Facebook...

1468
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:36,313
And then it's, like, this beautiful
picture of your grandma who's dead.

1469
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:40,025
And you're, like, "Fuck you, Facebook,
for reminding me of my loss."

1470
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:42,819
That's why you're avoiding me?
Because I remind you of loss?

1471
01:03:42,986 --> 01:03:47,657
Yes! I don't wanna be reminded of
sweet, young Julie and our kids

1472
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:49,951
and that beautiful time
in our lives is over.

1473
01:03:50,118 --> 01:03:53,330
Oh, God! Boo-fucking-hoo
with you two!

1474
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:56,166
You guys completely
ignore me. Always.

1475
01:03:56,291 --> 01:03:57,292
Yeah, no shit, cheater.

1476
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:59,044
Oh, "Cheater"?
That's my designation?

1477
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:01,087
That's what I am?
I'm the cheater?

1478
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:02,339
Fuck that shit.

1479
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:04,966
Did you guys ever once call me
when that went down

1480
01:04:05,133 --> 01:04:07,385
and ask me
my side of the story?

1481
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:08,803
You didn't.

1482
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:10,013
I would've told you the truth.

1483
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:12,682
I would've told you that Brenda
had stopped talking to me

1484
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:14,726
months before that happened.

1485
01:04:14,893 --> 01:04:18,396
Do you know she hooked up with her boss
at a company retreat in Wisconsin?

1486
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:19,647
Do you know she beat me up?

1487
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:23,777
She fucking beat me up at a
Romano's fucking Macaroni Grill!

1488
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:26,196
She fucking slapped me in front
of the fucking maTtre'd!

1489
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:27,572
I didn't know that.
I'm sorry, man.

1490
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:29,240
And I fucking
embarrassed myself

1491
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:31,868
and I embarrassed myself
in front of my daughter.

1492
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:34,704
And I thought, "You know, I
should pull back a little bit,"

1493
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:35,955
and fucking Frank showed up.

1494
01:04:36,456 --> 01:04:37,707
And I pulled back more

1495
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:39,584
and I thought, "One day
I'm gonna fix it.

1496
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:41,378
"One day I'm gonna
fucking fix it."

1497
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:46,299
And then I thought if I gave her
something awesome like a great night...

1498
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:51,846
I could get close with her
again, but I can't.

1499
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:58,144
'Cause she's gone.
They're just...

1500
01:04:58,478 --> 01:04:59,479
The kids,

1501
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:01,064
they just leave.
Oh, shit!

1502
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:03,274
I know how we can find 'em.

1503
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:04,692
Go to Cathy and Ron's.

1504
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:06,319
Austin's been texting them
all night.

1505
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:08,321
Did you hear
anything I said just now?

1506
01:05:08,488 --> 01:05:09,489
That's a great idea.

1507
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,449
Fuck it. It's just
good to say it out loud.

1508
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:12,867
Let's go flip that car.

1509
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:14,035
Hell...

1510
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:16,996
Jesus Christ!

1511
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:20,750
Oh, my fucking God!

1512
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:23,545
Shit!

1513
01:05:24,087 --> 01:05:26,214
My car just exploded.

1514
01:05:29,134 --> 01:05:33,221
Nanaru is 26 minutes away.
So that's good.

1515
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:34,472
I thought I canceled him.

1516
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:35,807
Thanks, Nanaru.

1517
01:05:35,974 --> 01:05:38,852
So Austin's parents aren't gonna
just tell us where they are.

1518
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:41,020
So we need
to get Ron's phone,

1519
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:43,982
read the texts,
and find our kids. Okay?

1520
01:05:44,149 --> 01:05:46,025
Hunter, it's not
gonna be you.

1521
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:47,527
So, Mitchell, it's you.

1522
01:05:47,694 --> 01:05:49,904
No. That's breaking
and entering. That is...

1523
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:51,448
I'm uncomfortable with that.

1524
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:53,199
Are you a team player,
or aren't you?

1525
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:54,367
Am I a team player?

1526
01:05:54,534 --> 01:05:56,828
I just chugged a 40 with my asshole.
I'm a team player.

1527
01:05:56,995 --> 01:05:58,455
Then get your head
in the game.

1528
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:00,123
It's the bottom of the third.

1529
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:03,585
We are down by one and there
is not a lot of game left.

1530
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:06,129
There is a lot of game
left though.

1531
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:10,758
Listen. You have one pass left.
One. One pass.

1532
01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:12,719
ls it rugby? ls it

1533
01:06:12,844 --> 01:06:13,887
Australian rules football? They
don't put a limit on passing.

1534
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:15,388
If it was the third,
then I'd have the fourth.

1535
01:06:15,555 --> 01:06:16,848
You know what? You know
what's happening right now?

1536
01:06:17,015 --> 01:06:18,433
Let me tell you
what's happening right now,

1537
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:21,060
is Kayla and Connor
are sliding into bed.

1538
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:22,312
He's grabbing a condom

1539
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:24,522
and then he's flicking it
to the side

1540
01:06:24,689 --> 01:06:26,316
with a smirk on his face.

1541
01:06:26,566 --> 01:06:29,319
That fucking smirk. No way.

1542
01:06:29,486 --> 01:06:32,280
We need a Hail Mary pass.
Are you up for that, son?

1543
01:06:32,447 --> 01:06:33,740
Yes, Coach.
Well, I can't hear you.

1544
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:35,492
Yes, Coach. I'm in it!
I can't hear you.

1545
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:36,993
I can fucking do this!
Let's go!

1546
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,369
We gotta be quiet.

1547
01:06:43,458 --> 01:06:44,667
Careful.

1548
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:51,424
All right, go.

1549
01:06:51,925 --> 01:06:52,926
Go.

1550
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:20,328
Did you...

1551
01:07:28,503 --> 01:07:30,797
Go.
There's a person!

1552
01:07:30,964 --> 01:07:32,507
What? Fuck you.

1553
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,677
Jesus Christ.

1554
01:07:48,231 --> 01:07:51,150
I'm gonna get you!

1555
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:55,446
Not if I get you first.

1556
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:03,788
Get away from here.

1557
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:04,872
I'm fucking out!

1558
01:08:04,956 --> 01:08:06,416
Mitchell, in!
Get in.

1559
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:09,335
<i>Cam'?</i>

1560
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:10,670
Ron, no talking.

1561
01:08:10,962 --> 01:08:11,963
Come on, we had a deal.

1562
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:15,341
We have to find each other
by sensing each other's musks.

1563
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:16,926
Can't use our voices.

1564
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:37,572
Here, kitty, kitty.

1565
01:08:37,739 --> 01:08:39,407
I can smell that musk.

1566
01:08:47,415 --> 01:08:48,416
Yeah!

1567
01:08:48,499 --> 01:08:51,419
Yeah! Yeah! I like
the sound of that!

1568
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:52,795
Oh!

1569
01:08:53,046 --> 01:08:54,714
on! Hey!

1570
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:57,467
You wanna touch first,
that works for Ronnie!

1571
01:08:57,634 --> 01:08:58,676
You want me to touch you?

1572
01:08:58,843 --> 01:09:00,094
Help yourself. Yes.
You want me to touch you?

1573
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:02,430
I'm gonna touch you. Hard.

1574
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:03,598
Do it.
How about I touch you...

1575
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:05,266
Do it.
...with my nails, baby?

1576
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:07,435
Let's have it!
Oh!

1577
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,563
Your hair is so sexy, babe.
Oh, your grip is unbelievable.

1578
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:13,483
L want you to touch me
where I like.

1579
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:15,568
My balls. You know?

1580
01:09:30,249 --> 01:09:32,919
I want it bad. Do it, come on!
Really? How bad?

1581
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:44,347
Let's go. Come on.
Come on, do it!

1582
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:46,307
You there?
What, this isn't hard enough?

1583
01:09:46,474 --> 01:09:47,600
Let's go. Come on.

1584
01:09:47,767 --> 01:09:49,310
- Harder?
- Come on, do it.

1585
01:09:49,477 --> 01:09:50,478
Do it, I'm waiting.

1586
01:09:50,645 --> 01:09:51,646
Okeydoke.

1587
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:54,148
Oh, yeah,
you like that?

1588
01:09:54,232 --> 01:09:56,526
Hey, man, I don't judge
people's sex shit.

1589
01:09:56,818 --> 01:09:58,236
But that was
ridiculous and stupid.

1590
01:09:58,403 --> 01:09:59,570
Way to take one
for the team, guys.

1591
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:01,364
Hold on, hold on,
hold on. Here it is.

1592
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:03,199
"The police came
to the lake house.

1593
01:10:03,366 --> 01:10:05,576
"Almost lost my flower
but didn't quite work out."

1594
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:06,661
"Flower"?

1595
01:10:06,744 --> 01:10:07,745
He said that? He's a boy.

1596
01:10:07,829 --> 01:10:10,164
Buh, buh, buh... "Heading
to the Park West Hotel.

1597
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:11,708
"We've got
the Grand Lux Suite.

1598
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:14,335
"Looks like the little boy
is becoming a man."

1599
01:10:14,419 --> 01:10:15,420
Fucking dork.

1600
01:10:15,503 --> 01:10:16,504
Okay, so that was
10 minutes ago.

1601
01:10:16,671 --> 01:10:17,672
So they haven't had sex yet.

1602
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:18,756
We can still catch them.

1603
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,633
Okay, let's do this.

1604
01:11:05,845 --> 01:11:06,846
Hey.

1605
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:08,264
Hey.
Hey.

1606
01:11:08,431 --> 01:11:10,016
How's she doing?
ls she okay?

1607
01:11:10,183 --> 01:11:11,934
No, she's not doing okay.
She's bummed.

1608
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:14,437
She doesn't even wanna kiss.
And I love kissing.

1609
01:11:16,481 --> 01:11:18,149
Give me your room key.

1610
01:11:18,316 --> 01:11:19,317
What? Why?
Yeah.

1611
01:11:19,442 --> 01:11:22,862
Give me your room key and then
bring her up in, like, 15 minutes.

1612
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:24,781
Uh, okay.

1613
01:11:24,864 --> 01:11:27,784
Yes. Thanks. You're the man.
Thank you for this.

1614
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:37,668
How we supposed to find them in this place?
It's got, like, 20 rooms.

1615
01:11:37,835 --> 01:11:40,755
I'm sorry, what the
fuck are you talking about?

1616
01:11:40,922 --> 01:11:43,925
"Twenty"? It's got,
like, 200! What? Twenty?

1617
01:11:44,091 --> 01:11:46,219
Grand Lux Suite
is on the top floor.

1618
01:11:46,385 --> 01:11:47,595
Go, go, go! Move!

1619
01:11:47,762 --> 01:11:48,763
Hurry, Lisa!

1620
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,202
What am I doing here?

1621
01:13:12,263 --> 01:13:13,806
on, my God!

1622
01:13:13,973 --> 01:13:15,850
Oh, my God, my favorite!

1623
01:13:16,601 --> 01:13:18,311
That's so sweet.

1624
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:20,980
Oh, my God! This is a dream!

1625
01:13:21,147 --> 01:13:24,609
It's, like, perfect! That is so nice!
You're so sweet.

1626
01:13:24,775 --> 01:13:27,820
It actually wasn't me.
It was Kayla.

1627
01:13:27,987 --> 01:13:29,447
She wanted you to have
the perfect night.

1628
01:13:29,614 --> 01:13:30,656
That's why it looks so good.

1629
01:13:30,823 --> 01:13:32,033
Well,

1630
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:33,534
why do you look
so good?

1631
01:13:33,618 --> 01:13:35,453
You're such a dork.

1632
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:37,204
I know.

1633
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:41,083
On, my God!

1634
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:47,632
Not as smooth
as I could have.

1635
01:13:52,053 --> 01:13:53,346
Let me get my shoes.

1636
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:58,684
Kayla?

1637
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:06,400
Nobody move, where's Kayla?

1638
01:14:06,567 --> 01:14:07,568
Kayla?

1639
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:08,861
Kayla?

1640
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:11,948
Get that outta here.

1641
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:13,491
Um, how's this work?
No, just leave it.

1642
01:14:13,658 --> 01:14:15,201
Okay, cool. Mmm-hmm.
It's difficult.

1643
01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:20,039
Play sports!

1644
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:27,797
And that's that.

1645
01:14:29,048 --> 01:14:31,008
So, you sure
you wanna do this?

1646
01:14:31,175 --> 01:14:32,176
Yeah.

1647
01:14:32,343 --> 01:14:33,719
Yes! Fuck, yeah.

1648
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:35,596
You're gonna penis me.

1649
01:14:35,721 --> 01:14:36,722
Yeah.

1650
01:14:36,806 --> 01:14:38,349
First I'm gonna...

1651
01:14:38,516 --> 01:14:39,725
I'm just gonna touch it.

1652
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:41,394
You wanna touch it?
Yeah, you can touch it.

1653
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:43,354
Yeah, yeah, go for it.
Okay, just, like...

1654
01:14:43,646 --> 01:14:45,314
Oh! Wow!

1655
01:14:45,398 --> 01:14:49,443
Okay. That is like the greatest feeling
I've ever had in my entire life.

1656
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:50,945
Really?

1657
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:55,157
It doesn't just feel like
a super-dry hand of a friend?

1658
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:56,867
No. Nope.

1659
01:14:58,202 --> 01:14:59,745
Okay. So,

1660
01:15:00,538 --> 01:15:01,998
do you wanna

1661
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:04,500
Put it in?

1662
01:15:07,962 --> 01:15:08,963
No.

1663
01:15:09,463 --> 01:15:10,464
Okay.

1664
01:15:10,548 --> 01:15:11,882
I can't. I'm sorry.
You know what?

1665
01:15:12,299 --> 01:15:14,427
Look, we don't...

1666
01:15:14,593 --> 01:15:16,095
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1667
01:15:16,262 --> 01:15:17,847
Holy shit!
Look at all of it.

1668
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:19,890
Oh, my gosh!
I gotta get over.

1669
01:15:20,391 --> 01:15:23,728
Okay. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1670
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:26,439
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry,
I'm so sorry. I just...

1671
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:27,815
It's okay.
I was thinking about it

1672
01:15:27,982 --> 01:15:29,734
and you, and then it just...

1673
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:30,943
I'm sorry.

1674
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:35,614
You're amazing.

1675
01:15:36,157 --> 01:15:37,658
I know we're still virgins,

1676
01:15:38,117 --> 01:15:40,202
but I feel different.
You know?

1677
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:41,412
Yeah.

1678
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:44,707
I know.

1679
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:49,837
You ready to, uh, do this?

1680
01:15:51,047 --> 01:15:52,048
Wait.

1681
01:15:52,131 --> 01:15:53,549
Wait. Um...

1682
01:15:54,759 --> 01:15:57,219
Ah, Shit.

1683
01:15:57,386 --> 01:15:58,554
Shit.

1684
01:16:01,098 --> 01:16:03,017
Maybe Julie was right.

1685
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:04,560
Like, maybe

1686
01:16:04,727 --> 01:16:08,189
losing your virginity doesn't
have to be perfect, but...

1687
01:16:08,355 --> 01:16:11,942
I feel like it should just be, like,
a little bit more special than this.

1688
01:16:12,109 --> 01:16:13,611
Yeah.
Like, not cheesy, but...

1689
01:16:14,153 --> 01:16:16,030
Like, if I was hard-pressed
right now,

1690
01:16:16,197 --> 01:16:18,699
I don't think I could
remember your last name.

1691
01:16:18,866 --> 01:16:19,867
It's Aldrich.
Aldrich!

1692
01:16:20,451 --> 01:16:21,744
I thought it was Ostrich.

1693
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:25,289
I didn't realize that you're a virgin.
You know?

1694
01:16:25,456 --> 01:16:26,457
Yeah.

1695
01:16:26,957 --> 01:16:30,377
Um, but, like, I'd still
be down to do it

1696
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:31,921
but maybe, like, you know,

1697
01:16:32,088 --> 01:16:33,714
when we get to know
each other a little more.

1698
01:16:33,881 --> 01:16:36,258
Like, maybe Monday
or something?

1699
01:16:36,342 --> 01:16:37,343
Yeah.

1700
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:38,427
Not to, like,
plan it and be weird.

1701
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:40,679
No, no, l can look at my
schedule and see if it's...

1702
01:16:40,763 --> 01:16:41,764
Okay.

1703
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:43,349
Pencil it in.

1704
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:45,935
Um, yeah, that's cool.
Okay, cool.

1705
01:16:46,102 --> 01:16:49,146
Let's just relax. We could do some
light journaling or something.

1706
01:16:49,355 --> 01:16:52,441
Yeah, yeah, we could do that.

1707
01:16:53,192 --> 01:16:57,530
Or we could do,
like, other stuff.

1708
01:16:57,696 --> 01:16:59,031
Yeah, like what?

1709
01:16:59,198 --> 01:17:00,699
Like...

1710
01:17:01,408 --> 01:17:03,619
Not sex, but...

1711
01:17:04,995 --> 01:17:08,457
I'm still down for pleasure.

1712
01:17:15,548 --> 01:17:16,966
You got this.

1713
01:17:17,133 --> 01:17:19,635
Hey, guys, what's up?
Anyone seen Sam?

1714
01:17:19,802 --> 01:17:21,387
Anyone seen Sam?

1715
01:17:26,684 --> 01:17:27,810
Chad!

1716
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:35,317
Oh, Jesus!

1717
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:38,946
What the...

1718
01:17:39,029 --> 01:17:40,030
You again?

1719
01:17:40,114 --> 01:17:41,282
You?
What the fuck?

1720
01:17:41,448 --> 01:17:42,783
What's your beef
with me, dude?

1721
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:44,118
I don't know
who the fuck you are!

1722
01:17:44,285 --> 01:17:46,120
I'm Jake
motherfucking Donahue!

1723
01:17:46,287 --> 01:17:48,122
That name means nothing to me!

1724
01:17:48,289 --> 01:17:51,667
Do you know what it's like to be
humiliated in front of everyone you know

1725
01:17:51,834 --> 01:17:53,627
and have to seek
redemption for that?

1726
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:56,714
Actually, yes, I do!

1727
01:17:56,881 --> 01:17:58,299
Kayla?

1728
01:17:58,465 --> 01:17:59,884
Kayla?

1729
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:01,510
Kayla?

1730
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:03,888
Get the hell away from my daughter,
you little piece of shit!

1731
01:18:04,054 --> 01:18:05,431
Dad, what the...

1732
01:18:06,265 --> 01:18:07,266
Oh, my God!

1733
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:08,851
Are you okay?
He didn't hurt you, did he?

1734
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:10,352
What? No, he didn't hurt me.

1735
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:12,396
Holy shit! Connor?

1736
01:18:12,563 --> 01:18:14,148
Oh, my God! Are you okay?

1737
01:18:14,315 --> 01:18:15,774
I'm actually totally fine.

1738
01:18:16,317 --> 01:18:17,276
Connor, I'm so sorry.

1739
01:18:17,401 --> 01:18:19,612
Are you okay, though?
Are you sure? Yeah.

1740
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:21,614
Dad! What the...

1741
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:22,781
What are you doing here?

1742
01:18:22,865 --> 01:18:24,200
I've been following you
around all night!

1743
01:18:24,283 --> 01:18:25,284
<i>Are you set...
Oh, my Gem!</i>

1744
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:26,493
You've been following me?

1745
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:28,162
Are you crazy?
You gave me no choice!

1746
01:18:28,329 --> 01:18:29,455
You're in over your head
with this kid.

1747
01:18:29,622 --> 01:18:32,249
lam not some pathetic damsel
in distress that needs saving.

1748
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:33,584
I can handle myself.
No, you can't.

1749
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:35,252
Yes, I can!
No, you can't!

1750
01:18:35,419 --> 01:18:36,795
Yes, I can!
Kayla,

1751
01:18:37,171 --> 01:18:40,090
you can't.
And that's why I'm here.

1752
01:18:40,299 --> 01:18:41,300
It's my job.

1753
01:18:43,093 --> 01:18:44,178
Oh.

1754
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:49,350
Yeah, so you just don't think I can make
my own decisions and handle myself.

1755
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:52,686
That really fucking sucks.

1756
01:18:55,814 --> 01:18:57,942
Kayla...

1757
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:01,612
Kayla, I'm just trying
to figure this thing out.

1758
01:19:02,363 --> 01:19:04,657
God! Why is sex even bad?

1759
01:19:09,787 --> 01:19:11,538
I don't know. I don't know.
It's not... You know, it's...

1760
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:15,584
I don't know.

1761
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:17,920
I'm...

1762
01:19:18,837 --> 01:19:21,423
I'm just trying to be
the best dad I can be.

1763
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:24,009
Well, you are.

1764
01:19:24,885 --> 01:19:27,179
You taught me everything.

1765
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:30,015
You built me up.

1766
01:19:30,182 --> 01:19:32,476
Made me strong.

1767
01:19:32,643 --> 01:19:35,604
You made me into who I am.
Like, that's...

1768
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:40,109
You did not have to save me
tonight, Dad.

1769
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:43,737
You taught me how to do that
a long time ago.

1770
01:19:45,739 --> 01:19:47,074
And I love you for it.

1771
01:19:49,535 --> 01:19:51,537
You're the best coach ever.

1772
01:19:56,875 --> 01:19:59,003
Thank you.
Thank you.

1773
01:19:59,586 --> 01:20:01,088
Oh, Dad, come on.

1774
01:20:02,298 --> 01:20:03,841
Come on, toughen up.

1775
01:20:05,551 --> 01:20:07,136
It was just really nice,
what you said.

1776
01:20:08,178 --> 01:20:10,180
It's good. It's good.
I mean it.

1777
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:12,766
Thanks, I feel like...

1778
01:20:12,933 --> 01:20:16,979
Like Phil Jackson when he
was coaching the Bulls...

1779
01:20:17,146 --> 01:20:20,774
And then
they were so good.

1780
01:20:22,443 --> 01:20:23,986
That's how I feel right now.
Yeah.

1781
01:20:24,737 --> 01:20:26,822
Uh, I should've taken
my socks off first.

1782
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:32,995
I'm just warning you, I've practiced a few
times but this might not go that well.

1783
01:20:33,162 --> 01:20:34,204
That doesn't look right.

1784
01:20:34,371 --> 01:20:35,622
Yeah, all right. I think
you need another one.

1785
01:20:35,748 --> 01:20:36,749
I think we need
another one, too.

1786
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:37,875
Wait, wait.

1787
01:20:38,042 --> 01:20:39,543
We have to do our dance.

1788
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:41,337
We have to... Yeah, yeah.
What, now?

1789
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:42,421
Naked?

1790
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:44,423
No, get me one of
those, um, hotel robes.

1791
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:45,758
I wanna feel fabulous.

1792
01:20:45,924 --> 01:20:46,925
Okay.

1793
01:20:47,301 --> 01:20:48,469
Coming right up, my lady.

1794
01:21:04,193 --> 01:21:06,945
We're gonna christen
every corner of this room.

1795
01:21:07,112 --> 01:21:08,113
And when we're done,

1796
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:10,032
let's FaceTime my parents.

1797
01:21:10,199 --> 01:21:13,869
Okay, but right now, I
want you to stare into my eyes.

1798
01:21:14,036 --> 01:21:15,079
What?

1799
01:21:15,454 --> 01:21:18,624
Mmm-hmm. I just want,
like, a real connection.

1800
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:20,626
So you just want me to
look straight into your eyes

1801
01:21:20,793 --> 01:21:23,545
for the next three minutes and 37 seconds?
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

1802
01:21:32,638 --> 01:21:33,639
Look at me.

1803
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:51,341
Dad?
Where is he?

1804
01:22:51,425 --> 01:22:52,426
What are you doing here?

1805
01:22:52,509 --> 01:22:53,510
Chad?

1806
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:55,179
Hey, Chad, you motherfucker.

1807
01:22:55,345 --> 01:22:57,473
Oh, my God,
are you kidding me?

1808
01:22:57,639 --> 01:22:59,057
Did he make you do something
you don't wanna do?

1809
01:22:59,224 --> 01:23:01,643
'Cause I don't care if he's the
fucking coolest kid in school.

1810
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:05,564
I'm gonna shove his fedora so
far up his ass, it'll be a hat.

1811
01:23:05,731 --> 01:23:08,400
No, Dad, we didn't do it.

1812
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:12,946
All right? And even if we did, it
would be none of your business.

1813
01:23:16,742 --> 01:23:19,453
It's just, I was worried about you.

1814
01:23:19,786 --> 01:23:20,829
Well, that's a first.

1815
01:23:22,247 --> 01:23:23,248
I deserve that.

1816
01:23:24,583 --> 01:23:26,835
Sam, I gotta tell you
something and I'm just gonna say it.

1817
01:23:36,637 --> 01:23:39,223
Sam, I have realized

1818
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:41,767
over the last few years

1819
01:23:43,185 --> 01:23:45,229
that I've made
a big mistake in my life.

1820
01:23:46,188 --> 01:23:47,523
What, like cheating on my mom?

1821
01:23:48,732 --> 01:23:50,484
Well, no. Marrying your mom.

1822
01:23:50,776 --> 01:23:52,861
But, no, that wasn't
a mistake,

1823
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:55,155
because then I wouldn't
have had you. Uh...

1824
01:23:56,365 --> 01:24:00,494
I've made lots of mistakes,
but the big mistake

1825
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:06,750
is that I let what happened
between your mom and I

1826
01:24:07,793 --> 01:24:10,379
get in the way
of our relationship.

1827
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:15,717
I'm sorry.

1828
01:24:17,135 --> 01:24:18,428
And I hope that

1829
01:24:18,595 --> 01:24:20,639
we can start over and

1830
01:24:21,807 --> 01:24:24,309
build up our relationship
again because

1831
01:24:25,269 --> 01:24:27,437
you're my only kid.

1832
01:24:28,981 --> 01:24:30,148
And I'm your only dad.

1833
01:24:30,691 --> 01:24:32,818
Well, Frank is...
Fuck Frank.

1834
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:38,448
Frank's fine.

1835
01:24:39,241 --> 01:24:40,826
Dad,

1836
01:24:41,201 --> 01:24:42,411
can I tell you something now?

1837
01:24:42,578 --> 01:24:44,913
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, anything.

1838
01:24:45,789 --> 01:24:46,999
I'm a lesbian.

1839
01:24:57,134 --> 01:24:58,510
What does your mom think?

1840
01:24:58,677 --> 01:24:59,720
She doesn't know.

1841
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:06,476
You told me before
you told your mom?

1842
01:25:06,643 --> 01:25:07,686
Yeah.

1843
01:25:07,853 --> 01:25:08,937
That's big news.

1844
01:25:09,396 --> 01:25:10,772
She doesn't know?

1845
01:25:11,648 --> 01:25:13,233
You didn't tell Frank?
No.

1846
01:25:23,201 --> 01:25:24,953
Ah.

1847
01:25:25,078 --> 01:25:27,497
Okay. Over. Crying is over.

1848
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:29,875
What do
your girlfriends think?

1849
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:31,793
No, I'm too nervous,
I can't tell them.

1850
01:25:32,085 --> 01:25:34,463
You're nervous
to tell Kayla and Julie?

1851
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:37,257
I don't wanna lose
my two best friends.

1852
01:25:37,424 --> 01:25:39,551
This is the stuff you tell
the people you care about.

1853
01:25:40,093 --> 01:25:42,554
You think they're not gonna
support you because you're gay?

1854
01:25:42,721 --> 01:25:45,932
They would support you
if you were a vampire.

1855
01:25:46,099 --> 01:25:50,062
They would support you more. With
all the <i>Twilight</i> shit.

1856
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:51,480
<i>Do we</i> Still <i>like Twilight?</i>

1857
01:25:51,647 --> 01:25:52,648
Definitely not.

1858
01:25:52,731 --> 01:25:53,940
No, no.

1859
01:25:55,609 --> 01:25:56,610
Oh, God.

1860
01:25:58,153 --> 01:25:59,780
Thanks for showing up.

1861
01:26:00,656 --> 01:26:03,784
Really. But you should
probably leave

1862
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:07,829
because it's insane that you even
came here in the first place.

1863
01:26:09,456 --> 01:26:10,832
I'd love to get
a picture with you.

1864
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:12,459
Yeah.

1865
01:26:12,626 --> 01:26:14,294
Great. Okay.

1866
01:26:14,753 --> 01:26:15,962
Just gonna stand on this.

1867
01:26:16,129 --> 01:26:18,173
Yeah, you know
the drill. Come on.

1868
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:20,133
Come on. Here we go.

1869
01:26:20,425 --> 01:26:22,719
Gotta turn it around here.

1870
01:26:25,847 --> 01:26:28,100
Dad, you're not taking it.

1871
01:26:30,602 --> 01:26:32,020
What?

1872
01:26:33,105 --> 01:26:35,440
I'll remember this.

1873
01:26:35,899 --> 01:26:37,067
Come on.

1874
01:26:37,234 --> 01:26:38,735
Oh, my God!

1875
01:26:39,403 --> 01:26:40,404
What's up, dawg?

1876
01:26:40,529 --> 01:26:45,283
So, I just, uh, parented
the shit outta Sam.

1877
01:26:45,951 --> 01:26:47,077
And I feel, uh...

1878
01:26:47,703 --> 01:26:49,413
Oh, God, like, uh,

1879
01:26:49,746 --> 01:26:51,498
pride, I think?
That's it.

1880
01:26:51,665 --> 01:26:52,666
It's new.

1881
01:26:53,417 --> 01:26:54,918
Good for you, man.
Thanks.

1882
01:26:55,085 --> 01:26:56,336
Well done, my friend.
Thank you.

1883
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:57,462
Well done.

1884
01:26:57,546 --> 01:26:59,005
How'd it go with Kayla?

1885
01:26:59,673 --> 01:27:00,674
Put Connor through a wall.

1886
01:27:01,425 --> 01:27:02,467
Are you serious?

1887
01:27:02,551 --> 01:27:04,136
Yeah. He's okay.

1888
01:27:04,302 --> 01:27:06,179
Yeah, he's lighter
than I thought.

1889
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:08,432
Hey.

1890
01:27:08,598 --> 01:27:09,599
Hi.

1891
01:27:09,766 --> 01:27:11,309
So, Julie's, um...

1892
01:27:12,102 --> 01:27:13,729
Julie's having sex right now.

1893
01:27:13,895 --> 01:27:16,148
Okay. And sit down.
Wowee.

1894
01:27:16,314 --> 01:27:17,566
Yeah.

1895
01:27:17,733 --> 01:27:18,734
But it's good.

1896
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:21,528
It's fine, right? I mean, you
have to do that eventually.

1897
01:27:21,695 --> 01:27:22,696
Right?

1898
01:27:22,779 --> 01:27:24,197
Are you good?
Yeah.

1899
01:27:24,364 --> 01:27:27,617
They seem like they really like each other
and that's nice. That's a good thing,

1900
01:27:27,784 --> 01:27:30,328
but it's just a little,
you know, scary,

1901
01:27:30,495 --> 01:27:34,374
because what if he doesn't know how
to do it right? You know, like,

1902
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:36,209
what if he doesn't know
where to put it.

1903
01:27:36,376 --> 01:27:38,003
But he knows, right?
Should I go back up there?

1904
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:39,838
No! No, no, no, no.
No, he'll figure it out.

1905
01:27:40,005 --> 01:27:41,006
It's one or the other.

1906
01:27:41,339 --> 01:27:42,883
Nope. Stay right here.

1907
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:45,469
Do you wanna have
a drink right now?

1908
01:27:47,137 --> 01:27:48,430
Like, hang out?

1909
01:27:48,597 --> 01:27:49,598
Yeah.

1910
01:27:50,348 --> 01:27:51,725
Yes, I do.

1911
01:27:51,892 --> 01:27:53,935
I'm in. I'm definitely in.

1912
01:27:54,644 --> 01:27:56,646
Um, we will be having some
shots of alcohol, please.

1913
01:27:56,730 --> 01:27:57,731
Yes, we will.

1914
01:27:57,814 --> 01:27:58,940
This is crazy.

1915
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:01,735
Well, I'm gonna, uh...

1916
01:28:02,652 --> 01:28:05,572
I'll let you guys have
your fun, and l will, uh...

1917
01:28:06,072 --> 01:28:08,116
I'm... I'm gonna
see you guys around.

1918
01:28:13,622 --> 01:28:14,623
Hey!

1919
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:17,709
You, too.

1920
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:20,712
Yeah.

1921
01:28:21,463 --> 01:28:22,756
Right!

1922
01:28:22,923 --> 01:28:24,257
Fuck,yeah!

1923
01:28:24,424 --> 01:28:25,634
Pifia colada.

1924
01:28:25,801 --> 01:28:27,302
Just get him a shot.

1925
01:28:29,012 --> 01:28:30,347
Cheers!

1926
01:28:30,472 --> 01:28:31,473
What a night, guys.

1927
01:28:31,556 --> 01:28:32,766
That's beautiful.

1928
01:28:35,894 --> 01:28:40,440
So, I don't think the kid at the lake
house was actually butt-chugging.

1929
01:28:40,607 --> 01:28:41,608
Definitely.
Yeah.

1930
01:28:41,775 --> 01:28:42,984
What?
Yeah.

1931
01:28:43,151 --> 01:28:45,529
And so he threw me
through a table...

1932
01:28:45,695 --> 01:28:47,906
- I'm so sorry.
- No, it was cool.

1933
01:28:48,073 --> 01:28:49,825
I kinda feel fine. It's cool.
All right, see you.

1934
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:50,992
See you.

1935
01:28:51,117 --> 01:28:52,077
Hey, guys.

1936
01:28:52,202 --> 01:28:54,579
- Austin, uh, let's go get a drink, man.
- Yeah, sure.

1937
01:28:54,913 --> 01:28:55,914
Want a fry?

1938
01:28:55,997 --> 01:28:57,249
So badly.

1939
01:28:59,584 --> 01:29:01,294
Can I have a fry, too?

1940
01:29:01,711 --> 01:29:03,255
Yeah!
Yes.

1941
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:05,590
So?

1942
01:29:06,633 --> 01:29:08,426
I couldn't
go through with it.

1943
01:29:08,593 --> 01:29:11,304
Yeah, l didn't. No.

1944
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:16,560
Holy shit.

1945
01:29:16,726 --> 01:29:17,978
You're a woman amongst girls.

1946
01:29:18,144 --> 01:29:19,938
Julie!
Congratu-fuck-ulations.

1947
01:29:20,105 --> 01:29:21,147
Thank you.
How was it?

1948
01:29:21,231 --> 01:29:22,232
Honestly,

1949
01:29:22,315 --> 01:29:25,694
it was a little painful, kinda
fast, and kinda awkward...

1950
01:29:26,236 --> 01:29:27,320
But absolutely perfect.

1951
01:29:27,654 --> 01:29:28,738
AW!

1952
01:29:30,156 --> 01:29:32,993
You guys, so much
went down tonight.

1953
01:29:33,159 --> 01:29:34,160
I know.
Including...

1954
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:36,121
Connor!

1955
01:29:36,288 --> 01:29:38,206
No!
Let's just say...

1956
01:29:38,290 --> 01:29:42,043
The Chef went out to eat my pussy.

1957
01:29:43,378 --> 01:29:44,629
It was good.

1958
01:29:44,754 --> 01:29:48,049
DJ Chad.
ls that Chad?

1959
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:49,342
That's Chad.
That's Chad.

1960
01:29:49,509 --> 01:29:50,802
Chad!

1961
01:29:50,969 --> 01:29:52,637
Scream
my name Yes, Chad!

1962
01:29:52,762 --> 01:29:53,763
Fuck yeah, Chad!

1963
01:29:53,889 --> 01:29:54,931
<i>I love me</i>

1964
01:29:55,098 --> 01:29:57,934
<i>Gonna love myself No, I
don't need anybody else</i>

1965
01:29:58,018 --> 01:29:59,019
Hey.

1966
01:29:59,102 --> 01:30:01,521
<i>Gonna love myself
No, I don't need anybody else</i>

1967
01:30:01,605 --> 01:30:02,647
<i>I love me...</i>

1968
01:30:09,738 --> 01:30:10,989
Guys, I gotta
tell you something.

1969
01:30:11,156 --> 01:30:12,157
Okay.

1970
01:30:16,328 --> 01:30:17,329
Really?

1971
01:30:17,412 --> 01:30:18,580
Yeah.
Wait, you are?

1972
01:30:19,205 --> 01:30:20,373
Yeah.

1973
01:30:20,999 --> 01:30:23,001
I love you. Forever.

1974
01:30:24,085 --> 01:30:25,253
And you, too.

1975
01:30:25,462 --> 01:30:27,005
Oh, my God!

1976
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:28,131
I love you.

1977
01:30:28,214 --> 01:30:29,215
Sam!

1978
01:30:29,299 --> 01:30:30,425
Excuse me.

1979
01:30:30,592 --> 01:30:31,718
I can't believe
you didn't tell us!

1980
01:30:31,885 --> 01:30:33,094
Y <i>I</i>
ay"

1981
01:30:33,178 --> 01:30:34,346
Ta-da-da-da!
Aw.

1982
01:30:37,557 --> 01:30:38,558
Oh, hey!
Hey.

1983
01:30:38,725 --> 01:30:40,060
Hey!
Hi.

1984
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:41,895
Oh.

1985
01:30:41,978 --> 01:30:44,856
Uh, Julie, I think we got
something over here.

1986
01:30:47,025 --> 01:30:48,151
Dope cape.

1987
01:30:51,154 --> 01:30:54,908
I'm not misreading things.

1988
01:31:19,599 --> 01:31:21,935
So you'll call me every day
till you get to L.A., right?

1989
01:31:22,102 --> 01:31:23,812
Yeah, and then, like,
every day after that.

1990
01:31:23,979 --> 01:31:26,022
Okay.
I'm gonna miss you so much.

1991
01:31:26,356 --> 01:31:27,899
You're gonna be okay, though.

1992
01:31:28,274 --> 01:31:29,275
Are you gonna be okay?

1993
01:31:29,359 --> 01:31:32,779
Yeah, I'm fine. It's the
weirdest thing because

1994
01:31:32,946 --> 01:31:37,617
I have been worried
about this day for 18 years.

1995
01:31:37,784 --> 01:31:39,285
And then

1996
01:31:39,452 --> 01:31:43,206
I wake up this morning
and... Nothing.

1997
01:31:43,373 --> 01:31:47,085
Like, I don't feel emotional at all.
I just feel like...

1998
01:31:47,252 --> 01:31:50,547
It's so bizarre.
What is that?

1999
01:31:50,714 --> 01:31:52,465
It's, like, splashing on me.
I know.

2000
01:31:52,632 --> 01:31:54,426
Isn't that so strange?
Yeah.

2001
01:31:57,429 --> 01:31:58,555
I love you, Mom.

2002
01:31:59,347 --> 01:32:00,640
I love you.

2003
01:32:03,143 --> 01:32:04,519
No, I have money. Like...

2004
01:32:04,686 --> 01:32:06,563
Lisa, tell him
I can afford... Mmm.

2005
01:32:07,063 --> 01:32:08,815
Sorry, sorry.

2006
01:32:08,982 --> 01:32:10,859
All right, come on.

2007
01:32:11,026 --> 01:32:13,153
Let's get this road trip started!

2008
01:32:13,319 --> 01:32:14,362
I love you.

2009
01:32:15,739 --> 01:32:16,823
Okay.

2010
01:32:16,990 --> 01:32:18,992
Hold on.
Let me take a video.

2011
01:32:29,377 --> 01:32:31,254
<i>- I love you.
- I love you.</i>

2012
01:32:31,421 --> 01:32:32,964
<i>Bye, Mom.</i>

2013
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,050
- I love you. Muah.
- Okay, bye.

2014
01:32:35,133 --> 01:32:37,093
See ya.
Drop Julie off in Cali

2015
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:39,095
and then you and Kayla come right
back home, and text, please.

2016
01:32:39,262 --> 01:32:40,805
- That's a big maybe.
- Please.

2017
01:32:40,972 --> 01:32:42,599
Hey, take care of
my mom, you two. Okay?

2018
01:32:42,766 --> 01:32:44,059
- We will. All right.
- Later, big guy.

2019
01:32:44,142 --> 01:32:45,143
I'm going to college!

2020
01:32:45,226 --> 01:32:47,353
Drive careful, young man.
That's precious cargo.

2021
01:32:47,437 --> 01:32:49,314
I love you!

2022
01:32:50,523 --> 01:32:51,524
Aww.

2023
01:32:51,608 --> 01:32:52,609
Come on.
Guys.

2024
01:32:52,692 --> 01:32:54,194
- Come on. We did it.
- We did it.

2025
01:32:55,236 --> 01:32:56,946
We did it. We parented.

2026
01:32:57,113 --> 01:32:58,782
We did it.
We did it.

2027
01:33:01,701 --> 01:33:03,536
Oop! It's Julie.

2028
01:33:03,703 --> 01:33:07,499
Oh, I must have been accidentally
added to the group conversation.

2029
01:33:07,665 --> 01:33:09,334
Oh, well,
should probably leave.

2030
01:33:09,501 --> 01:33:11,294
"Can't believe we're on
our own now."

2031
01:33:11,377 --> 01:33:12,545
Aw, that's sweet.
Yeah.

2032
01:33:12,670 --> 01:33:14,214
"We're gonna get lit af."

2033
01:33:15,006 --> 01:33:17,717
"Lit AF."
That's not great.

2034
01:33:17,884 --> 01:33:20,470
No, that's... They're gonna get literature.
African literature.

2035
01:33:20,637 --> 01:33:21,721
You think that's what "lit AF" means?
You think

2036
01:33:21,846 --> 01:33:22,847
they're talking to each other about...
Lit AF.

2037
01:33:22,931 --> 01:33:24,849
"Can The Chef get us..."

2038
01:33:25,183 --> 01:33:26,184
Trees?
What the hell's trees?

2039
01:33:26,351 --> 01:33:28,311
Trees mean weed, I told you that.
Mushrooms. Pills.

2040
01:33:28,478 --> 01:33:30,647
No, the pills are Kayla's allergy.
That's Claritin.

2041
01:33:30,814 --> 01:33:32,941
It's not Claritin. Look,
snowflakes. That's blow.

2042
01:33:33,108 --> 01:33:35,735
"Hashtag, no parents, no rules.
Hashtag, mad drugs.

2043
01:33:35,902 --> 01:33:38,446
"Hashtag, no condoms"?

2044
01:33:38,738 --> 01:33:39,906
Why would
they hashtag that?

2045
01:33:40,073 --> 01:33:42,158
Wait, is that a needle
and an eggplant?

2046
01:33:42,659 --> 01:33:45,370
What, are they gonna inject
heroin into some guy's dick'?

2047
01:33:45,495 --> 01:33:46,496
Let's go.
Let's get in the car.

2048
01:33:46,579 --> 01:33:47,997
I'll drive.
I'm sitting behind you.

2049
01:33:48,081 --> 01:33:49,958
Wait, wait, wait!

2050
01:33:50,125 --> 01:33:52,127
<i>We're
just messing with you! Ha-ha!</i>

2051
01:33:53,503 --> 01:33:55,421
"We love you guys,
don't worry."

2052
01:33:56,798 --> 01:33:59,801
You guys were so pranked!
I was in on it.

2053
01:33:59,884 --> 01:34:00,885
You didn't know.

2054
01:34:00,969 --> 01:34:02,053
No, no, I did. I didn't know
it was coming right now.

2055
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:03,263
That's why I kinda
sold it so well.

2056
01:34:03,429 --> 01:34:05,140
But it doesn't matter.
You guys were like...

2057
01:34:05,306 --> 01:34:06,766
"Holy Shit!"

2058
01:34:07,183 --> 01:34:08,476
Yeah.

2059
01:34:26,786 --> 01:34:28,079
Damn it, Mitchell!

2060
01:34:28,621 --> 01:34:29,622
Marco?

2061
01:34:30,999 --> 01:34:32,000
Polo.

2062
01:34:33,626 --> 01:34:35,628
Mitchell, are you
getting a snack?

2063
01:34:37,422 --> 01:34:40,466
I'm so glad we can do stuff like
this now that Kayla's in college.

2064
01:34:40,633 --> 01:34:42,844
I have no idea
where you are.

2065
01:34:43,052 --> 01:34:45,847
I'm gonna do so much stuff
to you when I find you.

2066
01:34:45,930 --> 01:34:47,390
Oh. Oh.

2067
01:34:47,473 --> 01:34:48,558
Marco.
Polo.

2068
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:49,976
Ah! Ah!
Polo!

2069
01:34:50,143 --> 01:34:51,436
I can't believe it,
it took you forever!

2070
01:34:51,603 --> 01:34:53,438
I spent so much time
on the stairs!

2071
01:34:53,605 --> 01:34:55,356
We're doing this. I know.
We're, like, totally doing it.

2072
01:34:55,523 --> 01:34:57,275
Let's just get crazy. I don't know!
It's hot. VVhoo!

2073
01:34:57,692 --> 01:35:00,778
I want you to grab my balls,
like Ron likes it, like hard.
