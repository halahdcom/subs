Yeah.

- Hurry up.
- Nice to see you too, mate.

11
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,960
Amazing news, by the way.
Congratulations.

12
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:27,915
Thanks, Marcus. It's pretty crazy, eh?

13
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,080
Pretty crazy.

14
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,210
- You okay?
- Mmm.

15
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,375
- Will you be alright?
- Well, yeah.

16

- Sure?
- Yep.

- Yeah.
- [engine starts]

18
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,828
So I guess you finally had sex
with a woman.

19
00:02:51,917 --> 00:02:55,377
Yes, yes, and... and she was...
she was awake.

20
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,250
- Yeah.
- That's a first.

21
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:02,543
I know. I'm sorry. I know you always
wanted to be the one I got pregnant.

22
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:07,245
Well, you might wanna double-check the
child doesn't come out looking like me.

23
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:11,133
So how you been?
All this baby shit. It must be mad.

24
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:15,418
Yeah, it is, man. It's insane.
It's fucking surreal.

25
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,790
I'll actually forget
that she's pregnant.

26
00:03:17,917 --> 00:03:19,747
It freaks me out every time I remember.

27
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,133
- It's insane.
- Oh, my God, man, I bet.

28
00:03:22,292 --> 00:03:25,042
- Yeah, yeah.
- Rather you than me, my friend.

29
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:28,997
But, you know... I am pleased for you.

30
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,918
Thanks, man. It's good to see you.

31
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,040
You too, man. You too.

32
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:03,707
- Bloody hell, man.
- Amazing, right?

33
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:04,883
Yeah.

36
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,750
Reckon you can take down a deer?

37
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:18,253
No. Probably not, no.

38
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,463
Not everyone can do it.

39
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:24,462
The trick is you have to switch off
your emotions, let instinct kick in.

40
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,963
It's never seemed very fair to me, man,
shooting a deer.

41
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:30,875
Well, life's not fair, Vaughn.
We learned that at school.

42
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:35,752
- Yeah, but we were 12, weren't we?
- [laughs]

43
00:04:36,792 --> 00:04:39,332
This is it, Vaughny-boy,
the last few days of your freedom.

44
00:04:39,417 --> 00:04:43,127
- You have to enjoy it, man.
- I'm sorry. I know. It'll be fun.

- That's right, yes.
- Yep.

00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,920
Addresses and phone numbers
in the book, please.

49
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,082
Hey, wee man.

50
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,195
It's quiet enough, isn't it?
Must all kick off around ten.

51
00:05:57,542 --> 00:06:02,252
So this is where they all hide.
Get a drink. I'm going for a slash.

52
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:13,035
- How are you?
- Not bad. How you doing?

53
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:16,828
I'm good. I, uh...
I hear that you're stalking.

54
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:19,377
- Stalking?
- Aye, well, hunting.

55
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,710
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, we are, yeah.
It's not really my thing.

56
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:27,625
It's my friend's gig, really.
He gave me a gun, got me a license.

57
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:31,038
- Well, you know how to handle a gun?
- Yeah, yeah.

58
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:34,747
I did a bit of shooting on a range
when I was at school, so yeah.

59
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:37,883
Yeah, we haven't had so many folks
stalking this last season.

60
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:41,328
There's a massive country club
opened 50 miles off.

61
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,378
It drained a lot of our trade.

62
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,460
I think my friend's made a point
of avoiding that place, so don't worry.

63
00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:49,902
Aye? Oh, good for him. I'm Logan, by the way.
- Vaughn. Nice to meet you. - And you.

64
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:54,458
Oh, Marcus. This is Logan.

65
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,793
Hey. Good to meet you.

66
00:06:56,917 --> 00:07:00,577
I hear that you lads might need
a ghillie out there with you tomorrow.

67
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:02,077
Oh, no. We'll be stalking alone.

68
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,170
It's all cleared with Lord Griffin.
My father knew him, so...

69
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:08,883
Two pints of IPA, please,
two Laphroaigs and...

70
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:12,038
- Can I get you a drink, Logan?
- Oh, no. I'm alright, thanks.

71
00:07:14,542 --> 00:07:18,752
You, uh... Well, you boys have
a good day's hunting out there, eh?

72
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,543
We will.

73
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:28,917
What? He'd have rattled on for hours.

74
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:33,457
What did you say? What did you say?

75
00:07:33,542 --> 00:07:36,882
- Shut the fuck up.
- Straight to his face, man.

76
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,708
Oh, the memory's still etched
in my mind.

77
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,962
Nobody tried that
with the field marshal. Nobody.

78
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,963
Fucking deserved it. The way
he used to talk to you, it wound me up.

79
00:07:45,042 --> 00:07:46,542
Loyal to the end, Vaughny-boy.

80
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,705
In that case, borderline insane,
but, you know...

81
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:52,037
God, he could be a mean old bastard.

82
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,078
Yeah. Yeah, he could.

83
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:56,172
You miss him?

84
00:07:57,292 --> 00:08:01,292
No, man, no. It's been...
It's been three years, you know.

85
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,038
Yeah, fuck him.

- I'll get these, yes.

- Jesus Christ. Take it fucking easy.

I'll knock you on your arse,
you fucking flash prick.

- Alright, Donald, that's enough.

15 years.

133
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:33,958
Met him at boarding school.
He kind of took me under his wing.

134

I haven't really been able
to get rid of him since.

135
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:39,833
- You went to boarding school?
- Yeah.

Why did you go there?

139
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,250
Parents went to work abroad when
I was 12, so they chucked me in there.

140
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,127
- Wow. That's pretty harsh.
- Yeah.

I think it's quite cool. I like it.

156
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:14,543
- Try living here.
- This is true.

157
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,748
So, how are you feeling
about being a dad?

158
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,955
I don't know.

159
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,583
I mean, it's fucking terrifying. It's...

160
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,958
Yeah, course it is.

161
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,578
No, I think you'll be okay.

162
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,378
I hope so.

163
00:13:35,417 --> 00:13:37,167
Cheers.

164
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,705
[knocking]

165
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,923
[knocking]

166
00:13:48,542 --> 00:13:50,132
Rise and shine.

167
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,630
Come on, Vaughn. Get up!

168
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,500
We're late.

169
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:58,173
Morning. Come on, Vaughn.
Hop to it. We're late.

170
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:01,997
Get up.

171
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:24,535
Someone crept back
suspiciously late last night.

172
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,955
Nothing fucking happened, man, okay?
So just shut up.

173
00:14:28,042 --> 00:14:31,422
Just... I'm just hungover.

174
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,580
I mean, how come you're so fresh?

175
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,963
Oh, you're not sniffing
that shit again, are you?

176
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:40,173
I didn't smoke. I told you, smoking
gives you hangovers, not alcohol.

177
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,000
Jesus, man,
I thought you quit that stuff.

178
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,825
I'm on my holidays.

179
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,833
Jesus Christ, mate. You look like shit.

180
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,788
Can you just do me a favor
and just shoot me?

181
00:15:23,917 --> 00:15:26,667
Here. Take a shot of this.

182
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,830
- Oh, fuck. I've forgotten the ammo.
- You're joking me.

183
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,920
We're gonna have to go back
to the hotel, mate.

184
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,380
- Can I not just use yours?
- No, you can't just use mine.

185
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,998
You can't put .270 ammo
into a .243 rifle.

186
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:44,833
- You'll blow your own head off.
- Okay, I don't care. I'll just...

187
00:15:44,917 --> 00:15:48,037
Use my .22.
And please don't fucking drop that.

188
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:21,287
You take it, man. I'm not.

189
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,540
It's your spot, your kill.

190
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:35,535
Now, remember what I said.

191
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:38,375
Just relax and let it happen.

192
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,918
Do it now, Vaughn. Take the shot.

193
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,580
Do it. Now, Vaughn.

194
00:18:02,792 --> 00:18:04,172
[gunshot]

195
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,750
Vaughn. Vaughn, come back. Vaughn, no.

196
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,753
Vaughn.

197
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,288
Vaughn.

198
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:43,377
MAN: Sammy!

199
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,498
Sammy!

200
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,040
Here. Here.

201
00:18:59,917 --> 00:19:02,377
Come on. Come on.

202
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,538
Okay, okay.

203
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,995
You fucking...

204
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:27,998
Shit.

205
00:19:34,792 --> 00:19:36,502
Sorry.

206
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:39,462
Sammy.

207
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,788
Sammy. Sammy!

208
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,830
Oh, my boy!

209
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,713
Sammy.

210
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,168
Sammy.

211
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,955
Oh, my boy.

212
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:01,165
Oh, my boy. Oh, Sammy. I didn't see him.
I didn't see him. I didn't see him.

213
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,043
I didn't...

214
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:34,785
I didn't see him. I didn't see him.

215
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,633
[coughs]

216
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,923
Oh, my God.

217
00:22:10,542 --> 00:22:14,582
Okay, here we go. Here we go. Come here.

218
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,168
There we go. There we go.

219
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:21,420
Come on. There we go. There we go.
There we go. There we go.

220
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:29,748
Run. Run.

221
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:31,535
Run.

222
00:23:42,542 --> 00:23:45,582
Marcus. Marcus.
What are you doing? Marcus.

223
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:51,415
Marcus. Marcus. Marcus.
What are you doing?

224
00:23:51,542 --> 00:23:54,172
We have to be seen hunting
somewhere else.

225
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:57,250
- What? We're just gonna report it.
- You shot a child.

226
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:00,748
It was... It was an accident.

227
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:02,583
- With my gun.
- It was a fucking accident.

228
00:24:02,667 --> 00:24:04,327
It's illegal for you to even use my gun.

229
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:06,208
I don't care.
We just go to the police...

230
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:07,923
- Go to the police?
- We explain.

231
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Stinking of whisky?
It'll be considered murder.

232
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:17,165
Can you handle prison, mate?
Because I don't think I can.

233
00:24:17,292 --> 00:24:19,292
Jesus, fuck, man.
Jesus fucking Christ.

234
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,668
- Fucking Anna, man. Fuck.
- Exactly, Vaughn. Exactly.

235
00:24:22,792 --> 00:24:24,882
You could be in for years.

236
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:30,457
And I shot that man from over
a hundred yards away. I'm fucked too.

237
00:24:31,542 --> 00:24:34,752
Because I was protecting you, Vaughn.
Protecting you.

238
00:24:45,958 --> 00:24:49,038
They were in a tent.
They were probably tourists.

239
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:51,745
And we are in the middle
of fucking nowhere.

240
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:53,833
In hundreds of miles of forest.

241
00:24:56,042 --> 00:24:59,462
If we bury the bodies, it could be days,
weeks, months until they're found.

242
00:24:59,542 --> 00:25:02,922
I'm not fucking burying people.
Listen to what you're saying.

243
00:25:03,042 --> 00:25:06,832
We go back to that town and we come
back here tonight and we bury them.

244
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:10,003
No, man.
Look, listen to yourself, Marcus.

245
00:25:10,083 --> 00:25:13,833
- We're not burying people.
- The alternatives are unthinkable.

246
00:25:16,417 --> 00:25:17,917
- Vaughn...
- Just shut up. Shut up.

247
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,883
- You have to trust me.
- I... Shut up.

248
00:25:25,792 --> 00:25:27,882
I'm getting us out of this, mate.

249
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:32,883
I'm doing this for both our sakes.
You just have to trust me.

250
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:37,205
I can't do this, man.

251
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:41,125
You have no choice.
You have no choice, Vaughn.

252
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:34,328
MARCUS: We need to be seen up here.
Further north.

253
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:38,582
There has to be something.

254
00:26:49,417 --> 00:26:51,497
[dog barks]

255
00:27:01,958 --> 00:27:04,038
[dog barks]

256
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,078
Hi.

257
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:12,665
Oh, it's a cold one. How are you?

258
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:16,750
Culcarran's south.
What are you doing up here?

259
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:19,245
We've been hunting Drumrain
all afternoon.

260
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:24,003
Aye, Logan told me about you.
There's no other stalkers out.

261
00:27:24,167 --> 00:27:26,207
[dog barks]

262
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:31,423
Be still.

263
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,670
- How much for the fuel?
- Call it 20.

264
00:27:44,708 --> 00:27:47,128
Thank you. Have a nice day.

265
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:53,377
Aye.

266
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:12,003
You okay?

267
00:28:17,292 --> 00:28:19,712
Nothing happened out there, okay?

268
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:35,750
Yeah, we could... Okay.
We could do that next... next week.

269
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:38,133
Oh, okay. Got to go.

270
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,630
- How did you get on?
- Oh, a total washout.

271
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:46,458
Oh. Well, no chefs tonight.
But there's bar food at the Stag's.

272
00:28:46,542 --> 00:28:49,172
Or there's the restaurant there.
It's pricey, mind.

273
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:52,173
- Thanks.
- Alright. Thank you so much.

274
00:28:52,292 --> 00:28:54,542
- Thank you.
- Night.

275
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:09,383
We need to eat.

276
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:14,245
And we need to get out there.
It won't look right if we don't.

277
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:38,630
Hey. Fancy some more drinks tonight?

278
00:29:38,708 --> 00:29:41,078
- Not tonight.
- Maybe later?

279
00:29:41,208 --> 00:29:43,078
Tomorrow.
Let's go, Vaughn. I'm starving.

280
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:46,538
- You okay?
- Yeah, just a bit hungover.

281
00:29:58,583 --> 00:30:02,133
- Uh, where is the restaurant?
- Just round to the left.

282
00:30:02,292 --> 00:30:04,382
Thank you.

283
00:30:14,667 --> 00:30:16,077
Evening.

284
00:30:16,167 --> 00:30:18,577
Join us if you like.

285
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,080
Yeah, sure. Why not?

286
00:30:24,042 --> 00:30:26,672
This is... This is Al.
He's a cousin of mine.

287
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:29,292
- Al, this is Marcus and Vaughn.
- Pleased to meet you.

288
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:31,285
- Nice to meet you.
- Have a seat.

289
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:32,995
Please.

290
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:38,538
Successful day's stalking?

291
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:40,535
Uh, no. A total washout.

292
00:30:40,625 --> 00:30:43,625
Oh. Well, let's see
if we can't improve things.

293
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:46,500
I, uh, well, I...
I recommend the venison.

294
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:48,293
Huh?

295
00:30:49,292 --> 00:30:52,002
- Yeah.
- Good. Peter, two more venison.

296
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:55,673
- Some wine?
- Please.

297
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:01,995
You look a bit rough. Are you alright?

298
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:04,995
Yeah, yeah. Just had far too much
last night. Stupid.

299
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:06,463
Don't feel great.

300
00:31:06,542 --> 00:31:09,042
That's really no state
to have gone hunting in.

301
00:31:09,958 --> 00:31:12,958
- Isn't that right, Alastair?
- Shocking behavior.

302
00:31:13,042 --> 00:31:15,882
LOGAN: Aye,
you wouldnae catch us doing that.

303
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,083
[all laugh]

304
00:31:20,292 --> 00:31:23,212
- As long as you had a good time.
- Yeah.

305
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:26,293
So where did you lads stalk?

306
00:31:27,917 --> 00:31:31,207
Drumrain. It's beautiful up there,
really beautiful.

307
00:31:31,292 --> 00:31:36,672
The woods are right enough.
But not the village. Not any more.

308
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:39,422
Yeah, what's happening with that place?

309
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,750
It's turning into a ghost town.
It's just dying, slowly, over time.

310
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:47,793
These kind of villages, they, well,
they survive on a knife's edge.

311
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:51,288
I can imagine it's quite rough
up here this time of year.

312
00:31:51,458 --> 00:31:54,958
Aye. And brutal not so long ago.

313
00:31:55,042 --> 00:31:57,922
There's always a risk
of things sliding back that way.

314
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Aye, it pretty well comes down
on the individual folk

315
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:02,503
to maintain the order of things.

316
00:32:02,958 --> 00:32:06,878
Logan and his father before him,
they held this place together.

317
00:32:07,583 --> 00:32:08,963
Aye. We all have.

318
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:18,080
Are you... Are you not enjoying that?

319
00:32:18,167 --> 00:32:20,417
No, no. It's lovely, lovely.

320
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:28,132
So, Iona tells me
that you're about to become a father.

321
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:31,748
- Yeah, I am. Yeah, yeah.
- Congratulations.

322
00:32:31,833 --> 00:32:34,003
Yeah, thank you.

323
00:32:34,125 --> 00:32:35,705
Is that a boy or a girl you're having?

324
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:38,535
Excuse me for just a second.
Be right back.

325
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,575
- [Logan] Early to bed tonight, aye?
- [laughter]

326
00:32:59,875 --> 00:33:01,915
[Al] Folk are resilient up here.

327
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,670
They'll take three, four jobs
to survive.

328
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,790
If the work's there.

329
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:09,035
So what is it you do yourself?
Finance and investment.

330
00:33:11,042 --> 00:33:12,882
Hmm.

331
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,920
Aye, we've... we've rested
on past glories here, fallen behind.

332
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:22,712
But we'll make it through this stretch.

333
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:25,833
And there's real, well, there's
real potential for development here.

334
00:33:25,917 --> 00:33:27,957
Absolutely. Anyone can see that.

335
00:33:28,042 --> 00:33:30,752
Listen, I don't wanna
put you on the spot

336
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:34,133
or sully a good dinner with business,
but could I give you my card?

337
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:37,788
Yeah, sure. I know
some good people you could talk to.

338
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:40,455
Thank you. Good man.

339
00:33:41,833 --> 00:33:43,543
Cheers.

340
00:34:36,458 --> 00:34:39,038
Is he... Is he okay in there?

341
00:34:39,167 --> 00:34:43,377
I should check on him. It's my fault
he's had too many drinks last night.

342
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:48,208
- AL: Aye.
- MARCUS: Are you alright?

343
00:34:48,292 --> 00:34:50,542
- Yeah, yeah.
- Alright?

344
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:53,625
I think I'm gonna waive the food
for just now.

345
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:57,170
- Stomach's not quite up to it yet.
- Aye, we've all been there.

346
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:00,460
Aye, some of us more times than others.

347
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:05,827
We'd offer another, but it's, well,
it's obviously not the night, huh?

348
00:35:05,917 --> 00:35:07,127
No.

349
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:09,630
We should...
We should shoot in any case.

350
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:12,170
Still lots to prepare
for Alban Eiler tomorrow.

351
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,830
- And what's that?
- It's a solstice festival.

352
00:35:14,958 --> 00:35:16,828
It marks the last week
of the hunting season.

353
00:35:16,958 --> 00:35:20,168
Well, it's just a... a piss-up
and a bonfire these days, really.

354
00:35:20,292 --> 00:35:22,542
But brings everyone together.

355
00:35:24,417 --> 00:35:27,707
The, uh, bill's covered. I insist.

356
00:35:29,042 --> 00:35:31,502
- That's very generous. Thank you.
- Pleasure to meet you.

357
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:32,963
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

358
00:35:33,042 --> 00:35:34,922
You're welcome. Take care.
Get some rest.

359
00:35:35,042 --> 00:35:36,292
- I will.
- I've got your card.

360
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:37,559
- Pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

361
00:35:37,583 --> 00:35:40,633
Have a good night. Take care.

362
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:43,745
This isn't going to be easy.

363
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,247
It's four hours till daylight.

364
00:36:55,458 --> 00:36:56,578
We need to dig a hole.

365
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,460
Six foot deep.

366
00:37:03,708 --> 00:37:05,418
Here.

367
00:37:10,417 --> 00:37:12,877
- Vaughn.
- Yeah.

368
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:37,670
- Fucking hell, man.
- If we're seen here, we're fucked.

369
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:40,958
You've been a complete liability
since this has happened.

370
00:37:41,042 --> 00:37:44,502
Vaughn, take the torch
and help me dig this fucking thing.

371
00:40:08,583 --> 00:40:10,673
Okay, that's enough.

372
00:40:11,833 --> 00:40:13,713
- You said six feet.
- I know. It'll have to do.

373
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:16,883
We've no time.
Daylight's coming. Come on.

374
00:40:26,417 --> 00:40:28,037
Okay.

375
00:40:28,792 --> 00:40:30,922
Under the arms. Ready?

376
00:41:07,125 --> 00:41:08,745
Oh, God.

377
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:20,382
What the fuck you doing?

378
00:41:28,542 --> 00:41:30,582
The other bullet's in his skull.

379
00:41:32,625 --> 00:41:35,375
It's traceable back to me.
It's as good as a fingerprint, Vaughn.

380
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,670
I don't fucking care.
Put the fucking knife away.

381
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,250
Vaughn, think.

382
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:41,633
If they find the bodies,

383
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:44,958
they'll find the bullet
and they'll come looking for me.

384
00:41:47,375 --> 00:41:51,495
It's a child, Marcus.
It's a little boy.

385
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:54,003
- Do you think I want to do this?
- No, I don't think you do.

386
00:41:54,083 --> 00:41:57,463
- So put the fucking knife away.
- I have no choice, Vaughn.

387
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,040
I have no choice.

388
00:42:05,125 --> 00:42:07,205
Vaughn. Vaughn.

389
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:09,832
Vaughn.

390
00:42:09,917 --> 00:42:13,627
Fucking leave! Move. Stay down.

391
00:42:13,708 --> 00:42:15,248
Stay down, mate, please.

392
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,880
The sun will be up in an hour.

393
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:56,380
We go back, stay for a couple of hours.

394
00:43:58,792 --> 00:44:00,882
Wait until the village wakes up.

395
00:44:04,792 --> 00:44:06,832
Then make our excuses and leave.

396
00:44:48,417 --> 00:44:50,327
What?

397
00:44:51,792 --> 00:44:53,882
Jesus. Come on.

398
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:14,792
Try to rest.
I'll wake you in a couple of hours.

399
00:47:27,958 --> 00:47:30,038
[knocking]

400
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,540
[knocking]

401
00:47:44,917 --> 00:47:46,997
Christ. I must have passed out.

402
00:47:51,333 --> 00:47:52,833
It's midday, Marcus.

403
00:47:55,167 --> 00:47:59,577
No harm done. We just pack our bags
and we get out of here.

404
00:48:03,708 --> 00:48:05,788
Come on, man.

405
00:48:41,875 --> 00:48:44,245
[man] This is it.
Give me that fucking knife.

406
00:48:53,083 --> 00:48:56,133
Something's happening.
There's people at the jeep.

407
00:48:58,042 --> 00:49:00,672
Hey. What's going on?

408
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,790
Whoa. Hey.

409
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:07,325
Tell me what you did.
Tell me what you did.

410
00:49:07,417 --> 00:49:09,457
[Vaughn] What the hell's going on?

411
00:49:09,542 --> 00:49:13,582
- Fucking fucker!
- Away from him, for Christ's sake!

412
00:49:13,708 --> 00:49:16,628
- What are you doing?
- Fucking bastard.

413
00:49:16,708 --> 00:49:20,708
Tell him what you did. Tell him
what you did. You know what he did?

414
00:49:22,667 --> 00:49:24,707
He fucked Kara.

415
00:49:26,208 --> 00:49:29,998
Gave her cocaine.
Filled her with the stuff.

416
00:49:35,917 --> 00:49:39,037
Hey, let him go. Let him go.

417
00:49:40,083 --> 00:49:41,633
Let him go.

418
00:49:43,042 --> 00:49:45,792
Get away, alright? I'll deal with this.
I'll deal with this.

419
00:49:45,958 --> 00:49:48,038
I'll deal with this, alright?

420
00:49:49,833 --> 00:49:51,833
[man] You're a boss, little brother.

421
00:49:51,958 --> 00:49:55,748
I don't wanna hear another word
about cocaine. Do you understand?

422
00:49:58,375 --> 00:50:02,125
Frank will take care of this.
Get the jeep over to the garage.

423
00:50:02,292 --> 00:50:05,082
Bring a truck over, Granty,
and the A-frame.

424
00:50:05,208 --> 00:50:06,748
Take the sex pest with you.

425
00:50:06,833 --> 00:50:09,633
So, will we look at the damage?

426
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:13,575
Cannae say I didnae warn you.

427
00:50:17,375 --> 00:50:18,665
That's bad.

428
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:24,040
And that one's slashed too.
They're both fucked.

429
00:50:36,792 --> 00:50:40,042
What the fuck are we gonna do?
That stuff's in the boot.

430
00:50:40,167 --> 00:50:42,537
[Marcus] We need to get it out.

431
00:50:42,667 --> 00:50:44,747
There's blood on the shirt.

432
00:50:46,333 --> 00:50:48,423
We need to get a car.

433
00:50:49,625 --> 00:50:53,915
And we need to get rid of it, and
we can't get rid of it near the village.

434
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:04,170
That second tyre, mate,
isn't gonna be cheap.

435
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:08,040
Can I get the keys? Just meant
to grab our stuff out the boot.

436
00:51:10,875 --> 00:51:14,535
Where's the sex pest? Lazy fuck.

437
00:51:14,625 --> 00:51:17,035
Granty, check that spare for me.

438
00:51:29,542 --> 00:51:31,632
Here you go. Can we get it today, like?

439
00:52:21,083 --> 00:52:22,753
Hmm.

440
00:52:24,417 --> 00:52:25,917
It'll cost you extra.

441
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,710
550, including labour.

442
00:52:33,375 --> 00:52:34,995
Okay.

443
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,080
Okay, send it up.

444
00:52:38,167 --> 00:52:41,287
- Do you have a car we could use?
- Nope.

445
00:52:41,375 --> 00:52:43,875
We just wanted to get
some last-minute stalking in.

446
00:52:43,958 --> 00:52:46,208
Well, you probably blew
your chances of that

447
00:52:46,292 --> 00:52:50,292
when you fed somebody's daughter full of coke.
There'll not be a queue of people lining up round here

448
00:52:51,083 --> 00:52:52,753
to do you any favors, pal.

449
00:52:52,875 --> 00:52:55,625
- Where the fuck have you been?
- Give it a fucking rest, will you?

450
00:52:55,708 --> 00:52:58,378
- [Grant] Do you need me this afternoon?
- No.

451
00:52:58,458 --> 00:53:01,878
I'll make do with that useless bastard.
Get your fucking rags on.

452
00:53:01,958 --> 00:53:04,998
Pete might take you out in his taxi.
I think he's in the Stag's.

453
00:53:05,083 --> 00:53:06,713
I'll get you over there, point him out.

454
00:53:06,833 --> 00:53:10,133
- Sounds good.
- Jeep'll be ready tomorrow.

455
00:53:13,417 --> 00:53:15,207
For 550, you can finish it today.

456
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:18,922
For 550,
I'll finish it when I fucking like.

457
00:53:47,292 --> 00:53:49,382
No fucking way, Al.

458
00:53:51,417 --> 00:53:54,127
He doesn't look good.

459
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:56,790
Pete, these guys are wanting a taxi.

460
00:53:56,958 --> 00:53:59,208
Then I'm your man.

461
00:53:59,292 --> 00:54:01,212
Let's go.

462
00:54:01,333 --> 00:54:03,793
Sit down, you silly sod.
You're steaming.

463
00:54:03,917 --> 00:54:06,537
- No, it's fine. Sorry, sorry.
- Sit down, man. Sit down.

464
00:54:06,708 --> 00:54:08,288
Thank you, though.

465
00:54:08,417 --> 00:54:10,667
Follow me, lads. Come on.
Take a seat over there.

466
00:54:10,833 --> 00:54:13,383
Go on. I just want a chat with you.
Sit down.

467
00:54:14,917 --> 00:54:18,457
There you go, boys. On the house.

468
00:54:25,167 --> 00:54:29,327
Now, these pints are for you
by way of an apology.

469
00:54:30,542 --> 00:54:33,132
An apology for messing up your car
and your stupid face.

470
00:54:33,208 --> 00:54:34,878
[Al] Brian.

471
00:54:36,458 --> 00:54:40,578
Even though you fucked my best mate's
daughter and gave her cocaine.

472
00:54:43,167 --> 00:54:44,247
Sounds fair.

473
00:54:46,458 --> 00:54:50,288
Sounds fair that I should apologize
to these arseholes

474
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:53,330
'cause Logan says one is due.

475
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:59,828
'Cause this twat here
is gonna bring investment in.

476
00:54:59,917 --> 00:55:02,497
- That's enough, Brian.
- No, it's not enough.

477
00:55:02,583 --> 00:55:05,253
Investments. Grants.

478
00:55:06,458 --> 00:55:08,708
Shite, the lot of it.

479
00:55:10,125 --> 00:55:12,825
And fucking embarrassing.

480
00:55:12,917 --> 00:55:16,957
Begging to city twats like this

481
00:55:17,042 --> 00:55:19,132
when we all know what should be done!

482
00:55:19,208 --> 00:55:21,628
Facing up to how fucked we are

483
00:55:21,708 --> 00:55:24,378
and doing whatever's necessary
to look out for ourselves.

484
00:55:24,458 --> 00:55:27,248
Whatever's necessary.

485
00:55:28,375 --> 00:55:29,875
Like folk used to.

486
00:55:31,542 --> 00:55:33,292
'Cause nae other bastards will.

487
00:55:41,417 --> 00:55:45,787
But Logan calls the shots
and apparently you do too, so...

488
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,540
I'll apologize.

489
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:55,037
I'm sorry, my friend.

490
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:04,920
And I'm sorry to you too, pal.

491
00:56:05,083 --> 00:56:07,173
- I'm sorry.
- Am I fuck!

492
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:08,710
Fucking...

493
00:56:08,792 --> 00:56:11,582
Take your fucking hands off me.

494
00:56:13,375 --> 00:56:14,785
I'm going anyway.

495
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:21,333
- Fuck.
- Better get yourself cleaned up.

496
00:56:21,417 --> 00:56:23,077
Fuck.

497
00:56:25,292 --> 00:56:26,632
I'm sorry about this.

498
00:56:27,542 --> 00:56:30,422
- No, it's fine.
- Just finish your pint, huh?

499
00:56:31,208 --> 00:56:33,248
Yeah.

500
00:56:39,083 --> 00:56:40,753
Some day.

501
00:56:44,542 --> 00:56:48,382
It's Kara, you know.
She stirs everything up.

502
00:56:48,458 --> 00:56:50,708
Hmm.

503
00:56:50,792 --> 00:56:53,252
[Grant] You know Brian's not alone
in his way of thinking.

504
00:56:53,333 --> 00:56:56,423
Well, they're wrong.
Let's not go down that road.

505
00:56:56,542 --> 00:57:00,672
I'm just saying. People are wound tight.
Logan needs to stay canny.

506
00:57:05,167 --> 00:57:09,377
- Where is he, anyway?
- He's out. Looking for Sammy.

507
00:57:10,042 --> 00:57:11,632
[Iona] What's the story with that?

508
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:16,130
[Al] Oh, they went camping supposedly.
Due in last night.

509
00:57:16,208 --> 00:57:19,628
Mary's not heard from them.
She's a bit concerned.

510
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:24,170
Logan's nephew and brother-in-law.

511
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:27,285
Oh, right.

512
00:57:27,417 --> 00:57:30,917
Logan'll find him. You know
how he dotes on that little 'un.

513
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,380
It'll likely be nothing.

514
00:57:40,875 --> 00:57:43,955
- Are youse okay?
- Logan's nephew's missing.

515
00:57:44,042 --> 00:57:46,542
Camping in the woods.

516
00:57:46,625 --> 00:57:48,955
Oh, right.

517
00:57:49,042 --> 00:57:52,042
- And when were they due back?
- They?

518
00:57:56,667 --> 00:57:58,497
Well, he didn't go alone, did he?

519
00:57:58,583 --> 00:58:00,753
Why not?

520
00:58:00,833 --> 00:58:04,463
- An 11-year-old on his own?
- He doesn't know what age he is.

521
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:09,460
Well, no, I just remembered
Logan mentioning something, didn't he?

522
00:58:09,542 --> 00:58:11,042
Yeah.

523
00:58:13,417 --> 00:58:15,497
Sorry. I just assumed.

524
00:58:21,125 --> 00:58:23,535
- So when's the bonfire?
- It's at seven.

525
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:26,495
- Right.
- Yeah, we should make a move.

526
00:58:26,583 --> 00:58:30,213
- Yeah.
- Let's make a move, then.

527
00:58:30,292 --> 00:58:31,752
- Leaving already?
- Probably best.

528
00:58:31,833 --> 00:58:34,423
You needn't worry about Brian.
He won't try anything again.

529
00:58:34,542 --> 00:58:36,832
No, we've had a rough day, and I...

530
00:58:36,917 --> 00:58:39,577
But thank you so much.
And it's my round, so here.

531
00:58:39,667 --> 00:58:41,747
- Oh.
- Get a drink on me.

532
00:58:41,875 --> 00:58:43,705
Thank you so much, though.
Have a great day.

533
00:58:43,833 --> 00:58:45,543
Sorry.

534
00:58:48,417 --> 00:58:50,917
Thanks very much for the drinks.
Thank you.

535
00:59:07,583 --> 00:59:09,293
- Get rid of it.
- Where?

536
00:59:09,417 --> 00:59:11,127
I don't care, man. Just get rid of it.

537
00:59:11,208 --> 00:59:14,538
Marcus, it's their fucking relatives.
Just get rid of it.

538
01:00:35,375 --> 01:00:38,325
They could start searching those woods
any minute.

539
01:00:42,292 --> 01:00:44,382
There's miles of forest.

540
01:00:45,292 --> 01:00:47,292
We just have to keep our nerve.

541
01:00:54,042 --> 01:00:56,132
What about the boy?

542
01:00:56,958 --> 01:00:59,038
Just hope he stays quiet.

543
01:01:02,917 --> 01:01:05,037
It's getting to me.

544
01:01:12,333 --> 01:01:13,963
Vaughn...

545
01:01:15,542 --> 01:01:17,582
Everything I did here...

546
01:01:20,333 --> 01:01:22,083
I did it to protect us.

547
01:01:24,292 --> 01:01:26,792
Every decision I made,
I made it from my gut.

548
01:01:30,083 --> 01:01:32,793
And if we were in those woods,
you'd make the same decisions for me.

549
01:01:32,917 --> 01:01:34,787
Am I right?

550
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,540
We were wrong. We were wrong.

551
01:01:43,917 --> 01:01:46,577
And we're gonna pay for it
because we should have just told them.

552
01:01:46,708 --> 01:01:51,128
Then go and tell them. Go and tell them.
They will rip you to pieces, Vaughn.

553
01:01:55,958 --> 01:01:58,788
Everything I did here
I did to protect you.

554
01:01:59,958 --> 01:02:02,378
And you're telling me I was wrong.

555
01:02:07,125 --> 01:02:09,075
You know you are, Marcus.

556
01:02:13,833 --> 01:02:15,963
Otherwise you wouldn't ask.

557
01:02:41,125 --> 01:02:44,245
[footsteps approach]

558
01:02:46,708 --> 01:02:48,788
[knocking]

559
01:03:05,542 --> 01:03:08,172
Alright? What you doing up here?

560
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:10,960
Just... Just having a drink.

561
01:03:11,042 --> 01:03:13,212
Well, get yourselves down there
for Christ's sakes.

562
01:03:13,292 --> 01:03:16,502
It's Alban Eiler.
People are expecting you.

563
01:03:16,583 --> 01:03:19,423
I think it's probably best
if we just stay in here tonight.

564
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,790
It's festival night.
Get yourself down there.

565
01:03:24,042 --> 01:03:26,292
Yeah, of course, yeah.
We'll be there in two secs.

566
01:03:26,458 --> 01:03:29,998
Okay. See you down there.

567
01:03:30,083 --> 01:03:32,173
[Vaughn] See you.

568
01:04:00,417 --> 01:04:02,537
- Help yourself, man.
- Thank you.

569
01:04:02,667 --> 01:04:04,917
Food's over there.

570
01:04:05,042 --> 01:04:06,712
Thanks.

571
01:04:43,708 --> 01:04:45,328
[woman] Have you told your mummy that?

572
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:47,540
[man] Bloody disappeared.

573
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:58,580
[Marcus] Something's not right here,
man. Something's not right.

574
01:05:08,792 --> 01:05:12,922
Guys. Logan wants to speak to youse.

575
01:05:24,167 --> 01:05:26,537
My sister's husband and son
haven't come in.

576
01:05:26,625 --> 01:05:28,495
We know. Sorry to hear that.

577
01:05:28,583 --> 01:05:30,333
But we've found the car further north.

578
01:05:30,417 --> 01:05:33,377
We've asked around
and we've a decent idea where they were.

579
01:05:33,458 --> 01:05:37,458
We're putting together a search party.
Will you... Will you come out?

580
01:05:40,958 --> 01:05:43,538
Look, we need help out there.

581
01:05:44,875 --> 01:05:46,245
- Yeah, okay.
- Yeah, of course.

582
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:50,710
Let's go.
The jeep's fixed. It's over there.

583
01:05:57,625 --> 01:05:59,705
Follow us out, yeah?

584
01:06:11,042 --> 01:06:13,422
Why did they give us the jeep?

585
01:06:13,542 --> 01:06:16,132
Because they want as many people
out here as possible, Marcus.

586
01:06:16,292 --> 01:06:17,962
They think they're still fucking alive.

587
01:06:18,083 --> 01:06:19,713
No, man. I think they're onto us.

588
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:21,825
I think they're trying
to force our hand.

589
01:06:21,917 --> 01:06:23,577
Jesus.

590
01:06:25,125 --> 01:06:29,205
If we make a run for it now,
then they'll know for sure.

591
01:06:40,625 --> 01:06:43,125
Jesus, Marcus, we're going right there.
We're going to it.

592
01:06:43,292 --> 01:06:45,752
This road's miles long.
These woods are massive.

593
01:06:45,833 --> 01:06:47,273
What if they find the fucking grave?

594
01:06:47,333 --> 01:06:51,253
If they find the fucking grave, you will
make a run for it, mate, believe me.

595
01:06:51,333 --> 01:06:53,713
[Marcus sighs]

596
01:06:57,375 --> 01:07:00,575
That was it. That was the place.
We've gone past it.

597
01:07:01,542 --> 01:07:03,832
They're going the wrong way. We're okay.

598
01:07:38,333 --> 01:07:40,293
What were you doing last night?

599
01:07:40,458 --> 01:07:43,668
- What do you mean?
- Well, what do you think I mean?

600
01:07:46,375 --> 01:07:50,995
Look, we went night hunting. I know it's
illegal, but it was my idea, not his.

601
01:07:51,083 --> 01:07:53,503
Well, that will be reported
to the police.

602
01:07:54,083 --> 01:07:55,793
Where did you night hunt?

603
01:07:57,667 --> 01:07:59,327
Uh, Gunn's Wood.

604
01:08:03,833 --> 01:08:05,673
Know how to work that, right? Yeah?

605
01:08:05,792 --> 01:08:07,882
Yeah, cheers. Thank you.

606
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:16,040
Just keep an eye on both of them, eh?

607
01:08:32,917 --> 01:08:35,537
Come on, come on.
Shh, shh. Here, here, here.

608
01:08:37,417 --> 01:08:43,577
[Logan] Three groups. Grant, Angus,
you two, take the right-hand path.

609
01:08:43,667 --> 01:08:46,077
- Al, Frank...
- Iona, you're with me.

610
01:08:46,167 --> 01:08:49,997
- Over here, come on. Let's go. Here.
- [dog pants]

611

- [Angus] Here, here.
- Calum!

617
01:09:19,792 --> 01:09:21,502
Hey! Sammy!

618
01:09:21,583 --> 01:09:23,253
Sammy!

619

Sammy!

620

01:09:48,208 --> 01:09:50,878
Angus. Angus. Anything at all?

626
01:09:50,958 --> 01:09:53,288
Here. Nothing.

627
01:09:53,958 --> 01:09:56,208
- Calum!
- Sammy!

628
01:09:56,333 --> 01:09:57,963
Sammy!

629
01:10:00,833 --> 01:10:04,423
We're really up against it.
It's just too large an area.

630
01:10:04,542 --> 01:10:05,672
Come on.

631
01:10:06,292 --> 01:10:08,002
Sammy!

632
01:10:10,625 --> 01:10:12,285
Sammy!

633
01:10:15,792 --> 01:10:17,462
Sammy!

634
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,790
Calum!

635
01:10:22,542 --> 01:10:24,132
Sammy!

636
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:28,080
Sammy!

637
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:32,125
Calum! Sammy!

[barks]

Dog's picked up a scent!

640
01:10:41,375 --> 01:10:43,535
We've picked up a scent. Southeast.

641
01:10:44,583 --> 01:10:46,253
Sammy!

642
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:48,075
- Calum!

[Angus] Seek. Seek. Come on.

645
01:10:57,375 --> 01:10:59,455
Here. Seek.

646
01:11:01,292 --> 01:11:03,712
- [man] Here you are!
- [Angus] Huh? Here.

647
01:11:06,958 --> 01:11:09,578
- [Logan] Is there anything?
- [Angus] Here.

648
01:11:11,042 --> 01:11:13,462
[Logan] Angus, what's there?
What have you found?

649
01:11:13,542 --> 01:11:16,542
[Angus] Over here! Dig.

650
01:11:18,208 --> 01:11:21,958
[Logan] This ground's been disturbed.
There's something here.

651
01:11:27,667 --> 01:11:30,037
[Frank] Help!

652
01:11:33,417 --> 01:11:35,127
Jesus.

653
01:11:41,583 --> 01:11:43,673
[Frank] Dig. Dig!

654
01:11:44,958 --> 01:11:46,958
[Logan] Here. Help me.

01:12:02,667 --> 01:12:04,787

01:12:04,917 --> 01:12:06,577
No. Sammy...

01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:23,170
They've gone.

Fuck.

661
01:12:29,875 --> 01:12:31,125
Fuck.

662
01:12:31,292 --> 01:12:32,382
They've gone!

663
01:12:38,042 --> 01:12:40,132
Brian.

664
01:12:44,667 --> 01:12:46,417
Brian.

01:13:21,208 --> 01:13:22,958
Use your fucking head.

01:13:23,042 --> 01:13:25,502
Come on. Angus, keys!

668

[engine splutters]

01:13:58,833 --> 01:14:00,543
What the fuck?!

670
01:14:01,625 --> 01:14:04,125
What the fuck? That's impossible.

671
01:14:04,208 --> 01:14:06,328
What? Hold on.

672
01:14:08,917 --> 01:14:12,207
- What the fuck?!
- Come on. Come on, man, fucking go!

673
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:16,417
Run.

674
01:14:24,292 --> 01:14:25,632
[Brian] Over there!

675
01:14:28,542 --> 01:14:30,882
No guns except Al. Come on.

676
01:14:33,167 --> 01:14:34,827
[Angus] Here. Come on.

677
01:14:36,292 --> 01:14:38,172
- Go, go!
- [dog barks] Vaughn.

[dog yelps]

679
01:15:21,042 --> 01:15:24,252
- Vaughn. Vaughn, get up. Vaughn.
- I guess I can't.

680
01:15:24,333 --> 01:15:27,463
- You have to run!
- I can't fucking move. Just go.

681
01:15:27,542 --> 01:15:31,792
- Come on.
- Fucking go, Marcus. Just fucking go!

682
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:39,000
No, wait. Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

683
01:15:39,125 --> 01:15:42,495
[Iona] Brian, no! Logan, do something.

684
01:15:42,583 --> 01:15:44,673
- He'll kill him.
- Get him away for fuck's sake!

685
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:46,460
- Brian!
- Get him away!

686
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:48,002
Brian!

687
01:15:48,083 --> 01:15:52,753
Al, take Rab. Take Johnny and Rab.
The other one, he went that way.

688
01:15:52,833 --> 01:15:54,923
Just you three.
I don't want a free-for-all.

689
01:15:55,042 --> 01:15:58,172
- Bring him in alive. Go!
- That fucker's mine!

690
01:15:58,250 --> 01:16:00,460
- We'll get the bastard.
- Stay in touch on the radio.

691
01:16:00,542 --> 01:16:02,212
Get Dad up here with the dogs.

692
01:16:02,292 --> 01:16:06,252
We'll take this one up to the farm,
find out what the fuck is going on here.

693
01:16:06,333 --> 01:16:08,383
Right.

694
01:17:28,708 --> 01:17:31,878
Tell us what happened. Everything.

695
01:17:49,292 --> 01:17:52,042
We were stalking deer
for about an hour, okay?

696
01:17:53,083 --> 01:17:55,293
And we found one in a clearing.

697
01:17:55,375 --> 01:17:57,745
I lined up the shot.

[inaudible]

702
01:20:07,417 --> 01:20:12,167
Any idea how sick this is,
what you've done?

703
01:20:13,833 --> 01:20:15,543
Sorry.

704
01:20:17,167 --> 01:20:19,247
That's not gonna be enough.

705
01:20:23,583 --> 01:20:25,883
That's not gonna be nearly enough.

706
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:40,855
How could you have done this to us?
How could you not tell us?

707
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:51,750
You... with a child of your own
on the way.

708
01:20:57,875 --> 01:21:00,205
- I'm so sorry.
- Stop saying that.

709
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:22,248
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

710
01:21:23,833 --> 01:21:26,003
- He's not going anywhere.
- Sit down.

711
01:21:27,458 --> 01:21:29,538
We made a decision.
What, you don't think I want to?

712
01:21:39,625 --> 01:21:41,915
Well, let's get it done right now.

713
01:21:46,208 --> 01:21:50,078
- You're not thinking right, Brian.
- Oh, aye? And how's that?

714
01:21:52,917 --> 01:21:57,127
People know they came here.
His wife, for a start.

715
01:21:57,917 --> 01:22:01,537
Now, if we kill them, this place
will be riddled with police in no time.

716
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:04,825
And I'm not talking local ones.
I'm talking real police.

717
01:22:05,667 --> 01:22:09,037
Last time anyone saw them was with us,
taking them out into the woods.

718
01:22:09,917 --> 01:22:13,667
Now, if we go through with this,
some of us'll go down for it,

719
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:15,750
guaranteed, and for life.

720
01:22:20,542 --> 01:22:22,172
This place will never recover.

721
01:22:23,208 --> 01:22:25,418
And this family will be ripped apart.

722
01:22:28,333 --> 01:22:32,383
Now, I'm not saying I like it,
but it's time to get the police here.

723
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:39,080
He's right.

724
01:22:39,208 --> 01:22:42,078
What real evidence have we got? Nothing.

725
01:22:42,167 --> 01:22:44,917
And he'll change his story
as soon as the fucking police get here.

726
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,920
- No, I won't.
- [Angus] He says that now.

727
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,290
- I won't.
- Shut the fuck up.

728
01:22:48,375 --> 01:22:50,535
- Quiet.
- They walk away from this.

729
01:22:50,625 --> 01:22:54,165
- That cannae fucking happen.
- I said fucking quiet.

730
01:22:59,542 --> 01:23:02,462
I don't wanna hear another word
about police.

731
01:23:02,542 --> 01:23:04,712
After what he just confessed?

732
01:23:06,333 --> 01:23:09,583
After what came out the back
of that pick-up truck?

733
01:23:10,417 --> 01:23:12,667
After what these cunts have done here?

734
01:23:14,042 --> 01:23:17,002
The unthinkable things
they've done to our family?

735
01:23:26,708 --> 01:23:28,668
This can only be paid for in blood.

736
01:23:30,083 --> 01:23:33,883
We're not killers, brother.
We're not like them.

737
01:23:33,958 --> 01:23:36,078
An eye for an eye, Logan.

738
01:23:36,958 --> 01:23:41,498
After what they've done here,
they're not leaving here alive.

739
01:23:42,667 --> 01:23:46,077
For Christ's sake, stop this.

740
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,880
- Think about what you're doing here.
- You've said your piece.

741
01:23:49,958 --> 01:23:53,288
- [phone buzzes]
- Now step aside.

742
01:23:53,458 --> 01:23:55,288
- Angus...
- Logan, get out of my fucking way.

743
01:23:55,458 --> 01:23:57,248
- Frank, no.
- [Logan] This is wrong.

744
01:23:57,333 --> 01:24:00,543
- [Brian] I mean it. I'm warning you.
- [Logan] It's the wrong thing to do.

745
01:24:00,625 --> 01:24:03,535
- [Brian] Get him up.
- Brian! They've found the other one.

746
01:24:03,667 --> 01:24:05,877
They've got him!

747
01:24:07,917 --> 01:24:10,787
- [Brian] Angus, get him in there.
- Get up.

748
01:24:12,083 --> 01:24:14,713
Get on your arse. Come on.

749
01:24:14,875 --> 01:24:16,165
Stay and watch him.

750
01:24:17,125 --> 01:24:20,535
Where is he? Vinny.

751
01:24:20,667 --> 01:24:22,577
We'll go and pick the other one up.

752
01:24:22,708 --> 01:24:25,208
We're gonna come back here
and finish this.

753
01:24:56,542 --> 01:24:58,632

[shouting, door bangs]

757
01:25:26,708 --> 01:25:29,708
[Brian] You fucking tell them
what we've fucking done!

758
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:31,285
What do you...

759
01:26:15,167 --> 01:26:17,287
Stop fucking moving.

760
01:26:28,833 --> 01:26:30,543
Come on.

761
01:27:02,042 --> 01:27:03,792
I've negotiated your life.

762
01:27:19,167 --> 01:27:20,667
But there's a debt to be paid.

763
01:27:35,625 --> 01:27:37,915
Don't think about doing anything stupid.

764
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,920
You've got two guns
pointing at your head.

765
01:27:54,292 --> 01:27:56,382
Now do what needs to be done.

766
01:28:00,542 --> 01:28:02,792
Take it. Take it.

767
01:28:02,958 --> 01:28:04,578
No. No.

768
01:28:07,042 --> 01:28:10,502
Do it.
Come on, you can leave here alive.

769
01:28:10,583 --> 01:28:12,673
No. Fuck, no.

770
01:28:13,667 --> 01:28:15,627
Then you die here with him.

771
01:28:23,292 --> 01:28:26,582
- No, it's not right.
- Not right's a long way gone.

772
01:28:28,792 --> 01:28:30,882
Now do it.

773
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:37,540
Do it or it's out of my control
and my brother will kill both of you.

774
01:29:04,292 --> 01:29:06,962
[sobs]

775
01:29:07,042 --> 01:29:10,752
No, you can. Put it to your shoulder.
Put it to your shoulder.

776
01:29:10,833 --> 01:29:14,383
Son, son, just... just pick it up
and point it and pull the trigger.

777
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:16,830
Pull the trigger.

778
01:29:17,917 --> 01:29:22,207
Do you really wanna leave your wife
and unborn child alone? Do you?

779
01:29:47,083 --> 01:29:49,133

Let's go through it again.

784
01:32:41,833 --> 01:32:44,153
Your wife picked you up.
And Marcus went north in his jeep.

785
01:32:50,958 --> 01:32:53,038
Marcus went north.

786
01:32:54,708 --> 01:32:56,628
Our relatives went missing.

787
01:32:59,542 --> 01:33:01,582
And we know nothing more.

788
01:33:03,542 --> 01:33:05,632
Nothing happened here.

789
01:33:07,875 --> 01:33:12,785
When the police come, keep your story
simple and make it convincing.

790
01:33:32,667 --> 01:33:34,747
[Anna] What's happened? What's happened?

791
01:34:42,125 --> 01:34:44,205
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

792
01:34:45,583 --> 01:34:47,543
You okay?

793
01:34:47,625 --> 01:34:49,705
[baby cries]

794
01:34:50,583 --> 01:34:52,673
I'll get him. You stay there.

795
01:35:00,375 --> 01:35:02,495
[crying continues]

796
01:35:15,375 --> 01:35:17,535
Hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.
