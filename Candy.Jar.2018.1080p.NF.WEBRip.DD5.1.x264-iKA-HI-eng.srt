1
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,051
[girl] Look at him.

2
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:13,596
Look at that smug look on his smug face.

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,224
He thinks the presidency
is his birthright,

4
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:18,309
like he's the heir to the throne.

5
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,854
I don't care who your mother is. [scoffs]

6
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:23,648
You just want to ruin my chances
of getting into Harvard, don't you?

7
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,710
Like when you brought in the governor

8
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:28,361
to upstage
my kindergarten graduation speech.

9
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:31,906
But I'm not gonna let you get in my way,
not this time.

10
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,493
God, do I detest you.

11
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:39,622
I loathe you, Bennett Russell.
I despise you, Bennett Russell.

12
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,586
- I abhor you...
- [man] Isn't that right, Lona?

13
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,001
I'm sorry?

14
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:46,421
Isn't your president
usually decided by a vote?

15
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:49,591
Yes, but since we have an even number
of members, we cannot have a vote.

16
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:51,843
- Well, how many members do you have?
- Two.

17
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,637
- Uh, she and I.
- Her and I.

18
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,599
- Her and myself.
- Him and me, myself and I. We, two!

19
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:58,826
- I got it.
- [Bennett] He gets it.

20
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,494
[Lona] Therefore,
seniority should take precedent.

21
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:03,563
- I'm a month older than she is.
- No, seniority, not age.

22
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:06,083
I've participated and placed
in more total events than he has,

23
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,025
including the state tournament.

24
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:09,569
I've also raised more money
than she has for our program,

25
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:11,738
and for our school
and for that lovely building...

26
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:14,341
You don't get to buy your way
to the top with your mother's Rolodex.

27
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:17,452
Isn't this ultimately
Mr. Johnson's responsibility?

28
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:18,535
Absolutely.

29
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,664
But he said that if he made the decision,
it would cause tension in our club.

30
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,209
- Principal Nelson, this is our...
- Co-presidents!

31
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:25,292
Co what?

32
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,587
Co-presidents!

33
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,464
Therefore, unlike years past,

34
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:31,716
the two of you will finally learn
how to work together.

35
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,844
No! Co-presidents goes against the purpose
of even having a president.

36
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:35,970
Fine. No president.

37
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,054
No president?

38
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:40,475
No president, co-president,
I don't give a damn.

39
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:43,394
A year from now,
I'm gonna be in the south of France,

40
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:48,274
sipping something strong,
sweet and expensive, capiche?

41
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,234
No capiche.

42
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,986
Lona, I don't have the energy,
I don't have the time.

43
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,923
Frankly, I've already forgotten
what club you're here...

44
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,281
- Debate!
- Debate!

45
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,158
Go. Out. Scram.

46
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,243
Shoo!

47
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,494
Go talk to Kathy.

48
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,831
[dramatic music playing]

49
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,763
[woman laughing]

50
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,099
[indistinct chattering]

51
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,280
[bird chirping]

52
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,453
[indistinct chattering]

53
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:56,384
[chirps]

[breathes out]

58
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,800
[sighs]

59
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,699
[Lona] Principal Nelson knows
how much we hate each other.

60
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,368
- What is he trying to accomplish?
- Maybe it'll teach you a lesson.

61
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,435
What lesson?

62
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:50,939
I don't know. Just sounded like
the kind of thing I should say.

63
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:54,651
Kathy, this is a vehement hatred.
There's nothing that we agree on.

64
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,111
- You both don't like the arrangement.
- Besides that.

65
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,405
- And you both hate each other...
- You're not helping.

66
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,200
You are now one of the presidents.

67
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,619
Put that in your little Harvard
application and move on.

68
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:07,205
- To what?
- To whatever your heart desires.

69
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:10,291
Kathy, my heart is a muscular organ
that pumps blood through my body,

70
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,645
and, although romanticized,
has no bearing on my love life

71
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,629
- or my moral decision-making.
- All right.

72
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,506
Let me rephrase.

73
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,508
You ask anybody to Homecoming yet?

74
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,343
No.

75
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,303
I'm not a social person.

76
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:26,266
So what? You think I waited around
for some guy to ask me out?

77
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,977
No, sir.
I got things done on my own terms.

78
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,770
And look at me, I did great.

79
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,022
Sorry.

80
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:36,234
My greatest skill is arguing with people.
That's not date material.

81
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:39,195
If you show up at that dance
wearing a tux,

82
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,616
you're gonna be approached by more ladies
than that guy on that sexist TV show,

83
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,885
I can never remember the name.

84
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,911
What's it called,
the one with the bachelor?

85
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,913
- The Bachelor.
- That's the one.

86
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,082
I mean, but why have a relationship
in high school?

87
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,936
You wind up at different colleges,
and then it was all a waste of time.

88
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,921
Why do you guys take Calculus
when you're not gonna become engineers?

89
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,881
Because Calculus teaches you to...

90
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,570
Whatever it teaches you,
it doesn't matter.

91
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:04,721
It gives you tools, right?

92
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,432
So your argument
is that I'll become a better kisser?

93
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,600
No! My argument...

94
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,103
Well, yes. Wait, yes!

95
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,606
I was gonna talk about lasting
relationships, but kissing is better.

96
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,693
Forget Yale.
Focus on becoming a better kisser.

97
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:21,738
- Are you writing this down?
- You want me to write it?

98
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,239
The world needs good men

99
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,824
- who know how to kiss.
- [sighs]

100
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,659
I'm dead serious.
Are you writing this down?

101
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:27,845
- No!
- [Bennett] Well, you should,

102
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,763
because Research Connection
is the gold standard!

103
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,907
You can't even do
a date-specific search on that site,

104
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:34,018
- and it's a hundred dollars more...
- It's $50 more.

105
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,669
Yeah, easy for you to say
when you wipe your ass with $50 bills.

106
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,356
But for those of us who don't have
the opportunity to have that luxury...

107
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,380
Stop!

108
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,466
[both sighing]

109
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,176
Not my tempo.

110
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:47,638
"Not my tempo."
Come on, from Whiplash.

111
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:51,142
Really? Nobody saw it? JK Simmons.
He won an Academy Award.

112
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:52,685
Mr. Johnson, as I was saying...

113
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,496
The extra 50 bucks
is within our budget, Lona.

114
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,665
And furthermore,
there's no reason you should ever mention

115
00:05:56,689 --> 00:06:00,151
your fellow student's estimated wealth
and whether they can or cannot afford

116
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,737
to wipe their butts
with any type of currency.

117
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,489
Mr. Johnson, it's a terrible site.

118
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:07,134
We only get to buy a subscription
to one research database per year,

119
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,202
and it should be East Law.
It's ranked number one.

120
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,746
- By you and your mom?
- By U.S. News Report.

121
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,509
And besides,
we have to conserve our funds,

122
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,976
so that Taylor and Tucker
have the resources they need to learn.

123
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,834
Who?

124
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,587
Taylor and Tanner
joined our club this afternoon.

125
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,799
[Lona]
And they deserve to have an opinion.

126
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,802
Democracy is democracy.
It doesn't matter if they're uneducated.

127
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,696
- [Mr. Johnson] New. She means new.
- Same difference.

128
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,638
She means new.

129
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,973
We don't even know
what a research database is.

130
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,558
You both are going to do great.

131
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,120
[Mr. Johnson] Now, first of all,
this team needed some new faces,

132
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,896
and apparently a new attitude.

133
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,357
Second of all,
if we're gonna get anywhere this year,

134
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,318
you two have gotta agree
on something, anything,

135
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:44,779
or I swear
I'm gonna make the twins co-presidents.

136
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:50,576
Bennett said he raised money?
Am I to assume he went door to door?

137
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,205
'Cause his mother's an ATM with lipstick
who releases 50s every time she farts.

138
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,082
She's a very popular senator.

139
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,583
- Please.
- [man speaking on TV]

140
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,336
- Julia's a state senator.
- [scoffs]

141
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:03,172
And to me, she's still the teenage robot
who lived in the library.

142
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,507
Hey! I live in the library.

143
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,801
- Yeah, you're different.
- Different how?

144
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:08,594
You're just different.

145
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,472
Listen, tomorrow you're gonna win
another trophy

146
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,975
and the Harvard application
isn't due for another week...

147
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,058
Four days.

148
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,520
Shit! Four days?

149
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,440
Okay, well, did you write it in?

150
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,067
Yes. Lona Skinner, co-president...

151
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,236
...of the Hemlock Prep Academy
Debate Club.

152
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,572
You should be proud of that.

153

- [breathes out]
- What?

154

You earned it, and you are qualified,
and you are my son.

Listen, I was in D.C. last week.
I'm going to D.C. next week,

159
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,137

I will buy each of them a diaper.

161
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:04,525
As a first-generation college student,
I know the importance of higher education,

162
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:08,279
which is why I started this foundation
that hands out scholarships.

Sorry, baby.

165
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,452
No, it's just that
being co-presidents is ridiculous,

166
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:16,454
- because Lona is impossible to work with.
- Oh!

that's getting into Yale. Am I right?

you'll qualify for the state tournament

No. Because you're smart.

And you're a hard worker.

I negate the costs of a college education
outweigh the benefits.

254
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:59,171
One: during times of economic depression
college educations are vital.

255
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,835
Given the uncertain nature of the economy

256
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,063
a college education can function
as an insurance policy.

257
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,010
First, the demand for college degrees
is rising.

258

Getting a college education
is more important than ever.

with higher lifetime earnings.

If people have more money in their pockets
they're able to spend that money...

262
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,689
The labor report we provided predicts
job openings will soon increase

263
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,840
as the Baby Boomer generation
continues to retire.

264
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,693
Therefore, we should encourage
college graduation

265
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,236
to ensure people have enough
disposable income

What's your question?

278
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:48,970
Why do you talk so fast when you debate?

279
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,806
A few years back, they changed the rules
so we only have eight minutes per round.

280
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,226
And then everyone started speaking faster
to get more points.

281
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,167
The more arguments you make,

282
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,331
the more arguments your opponents
have to respond to.

283

- You can't.
- You can?

Nobody can.

286

Everyone emails judges and opponents
everything right before the debate.

When you're debating, don't get bored
by the sound of your own voice.

00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,741
It's cold outside.

476
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,493
[chuckles]

477
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,913
That's a keen observation.

478
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,249
Well, we got the regional qualifier
tomorrow, so...

479
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,332
Is it tomorrow?

480
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,961
[scoffs]
God, I better start preparing. Hmm.

481
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,005
[chuckles]

482
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,967
- [Lona sighs]
- [thunder rumbling]

483
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,807
You'll take me straight home?

484
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:43,064
[Bennett] Let me get a number four
with a large fry and a vanilla shake.

485
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:44,691
Do you want something?

486
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:46,651
You were supposed
to take me straight home.

487
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,570
I don't even understand why we're here.

488
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,740
- She'll have a chocolate shake.
- I'm not drinking that.

489
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,575
I saw a documentary
about places like this

490
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,911
called Fast and Furious:
On Your Intestines.

491
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,580
Sure, it goes down easy.
But you'll be curled over...

492
00:24:58,663 --> 00:24:59,998
[whirring]

493
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,585
[squeaks]

494
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:12,105
They said it was supposed to rain tonight.

495
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,887
[thunder rumbling]

496
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:14,970
It might.

497
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:18,183
Why are you even eating here? Hmm?

498
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:19,935
Is your personal chef on holiday?

499
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,561
He's vacationing in Belize.

500
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:23,688
[chuckles]

501
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,023
I don't have a chef.

502
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:28,151
Well, you should,
because this crap will kill you.

503
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:31,529
I don't know how anyone could make
the conscious decision to eat here.

504
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,615
I'm not drinking it.

505
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,492
[slurps]

506
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:36,785
[Bennett] Right? Yeah?

507
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,663
This time, dip a fry inside.

508
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,874
[Lona] That's disgusting.

509
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,751
[Bennett] Everything's better with fries.

510
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:48,004
I mean, sweet and salty perfection.

511
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,088
Here.

512
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,173
Try it.

513
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,642
[slurps]

514
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,941
No, thank you.

515
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,067
It's just a jacket.

516
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,457
[siren wailing at a distance]

517
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:35,802
Thanks for the shake.

518
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,352
[Lona] Don't be late tomorrow.

519
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,021
[dog barking]

- [cell phone ringing]
- [yawns]

522
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,743
[woman on phone]
Hi, Bennett. It's your mother.

523
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,536
I know you're inside,

524
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:04,622
but I know today is also the day
for the qualifiers,

525
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,624
so I wanted to wish you luck

526
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,794
because I know you are going to qualify
and be at that state tournament.

527
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:14,007
I also wanted to let you know
that in anticipation of that excitement,

528
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:17,427
I reserved us two rooms at that hotel,
the one with the waterfall.

529
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,636
I can't wait.

530
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,306
Anyway, have a great day, honey.
Oh! And before I forget,

531
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:25,727
I laid on your bed that outfit
that I think is just so damn charming.

532
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,771
I'm so excited. I love you!

533
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:29,356
[panting]

534
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:33,943
So do you like arguing the con side
or the pro side?

535
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:37,197
[Lona] It's called "aff" for affirmative
and "neg" for negative.

536
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,199
That's what I meant, aff or neg.

537
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:42,160
- It doesn't matter.
- No, I know, but...

538
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:44,621
That's why we have
the same debate topic all year long,

539
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:47,290
so that we get to know
both sides intimately.

540
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:50,085
But which one are you hoping
that you get to argue?

541
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:53,380
That sort of thinking
is a loser's mentality.

542
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:57,634
Totally. It was a test. Oh, shit!
I left my phone in the car.

543
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:58,917
- I'll meet you inside.
- Okay.

544
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:03,681
[car honking]

545
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:15,443
- Oh! Hi, Amy.
- Julia.

546
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:17,779
Baby, I'll see you inside.

547
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:24,244
Bennett tells me
Lona's applied to Harvard.

548
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:25,161
That's right.

549
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,580
That is incredible.

550
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:30,504
You gotta dream big, you know.
You can't listen to what the critics say.

551
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,044
If you want to do something, you do it.

552
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:36,148
- Bennett's applying to Yale?
- Yeah. [chuckles]

553
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:38,317
I mean, obviously,
I would've been happy if he went anywhere

554
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:40,009
but he just fell in love with it, so...

555
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,093
[chuckles]

556
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,512
Like mother, like son.

557
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:43,471
Right.

558
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,598

00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:47,684
[sighs]

560
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,520
Oh, did you want to get something
from your car?

561
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:52,855
Oh!

562
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,751
I was going to grab something
but then we started talking, so...

563
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:57,652
You can get it
and then we can go in together.

564
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:58,736
No, it's no big deal.

565
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,742
I'm sorry? It's no big deal
and you don't need anything,

566
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:06,286
or it's no big deal
and you don't want me to wait?

567
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:08,889
I would have to look for it
and you would just be standing there

568
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:11,583
and I didn't want it to be awkward, so...

569
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:13,333
[chuckles]

570
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,130
I'll see you inside, Amy.

571
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,884
[keys jangling]

What was that back there?

579
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,796
Everyone found out their first assignment.

580
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,620
Who they're debating, what time and where.

581
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:49,954
- Even you two?
- Yep.

582
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,791
- Why didn't you look at your phones?
- It's a sign of weakness.

583
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,626
So you guys think you're gonna win again?

584
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:58,463
At a regional qualifier,
there's no winner.

585
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:01,257
The top four contestants will move on
to the state tournament.

586
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,319
[boy 1] The costs of a college education
are outweighed by the benefits.

587
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:06,030
A college education is a strong, positive
predictor of economic mobility...

588
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,254
Consider why the costs of a college
education are way...

589
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,853
[boy 2] People don't learn anything
substantial in college...

590
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,775
[Bennett] In 1970, almost 60 percent
of high school graduates...

591
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:22,838
The fact that such a high number
of students need to be re-taught skills

592
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:24,590
learned in high school
prior to commencing collegiate study

593
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:27,092
demonstrates people are ending up
in college who should not be there.

594
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:28,493
[girl speaking rapidly]

595
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:43,550
Is anyone not ready?

596
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:46,529
[boy 3] I affirm the costs of a college
education are outweighed by the benefits.

597
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:49,180
It's always important
to scout potential opponents.

598
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,825
But you don't have any more debates today.

599
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,809
We're scouting opponents
for the state tournament.

600
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,858
This is his opening statement

601
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:02,402
- which is why he's being so...
- Cute?

602
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:05,530
Well, I was gonna say vague, but sure.

603
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,991
We do that here
and that is why you must vote aff.

604
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:09,617
[timer beeps]

605
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,001
Is anybody not ready?

606
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,587
[clears throat]

607
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,965
Whether or not college is worth
the price of admissions

608
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,009
is not the debate
we should be having today.

609
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:29,137
Let me tell you a story.

610
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:33,766
Both of my parents have to work two jobs
to provide for my family.

611
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,311
And they don't have the luxury of funding

612
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:39,480
the test prep courses,
essay coaches and tutors

613
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,233
that many of my peers have access to
in order to get a leg up...

614
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,545
- [whispers] Why is she talking so slow?
- [Lona and Bennett] Shh!

615
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,321
[both] Pay attention.

616
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,364
...the admissions process is desirable.

617
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:51,576
Better yet, appropriate,
or even necessary,

618
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:56,164
given the significant social
and financial pressures that it places

619
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:59,208
on individual students and their families,

620
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:02,754
especially those
from low-income households

621
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:05,149
- like the one I grew up in.
- Is debating like this even allowed?

622
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:08,676
The rules state you're supposed to offer
evidence to argue aff or neg.

623
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,971
But the evidence you use
is, well, debatable.

624
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,264
I don't get it.

625
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:16,017
Okay, if I was going to argue
water is wet,

626
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,020
my evidence would be scientific data
that proves on Planet Earth,

627
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:23,441
throughout history, time and time again,
water has always been proven wet.

628
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,544
- And I would cite my references.
- Because those are facts.

629
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:29,030
And it's way more convincing
than if my evidence was water is wet

630
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,365
because I touched it once.

631
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,950
Because you can't touch the evidence.

632
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,786
- No. Because it's anecdotal.
- It's what?

633
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:38,456
It's what Jasmine was doing
and what she does every debate.

634
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:40,875
She talks about her personal experiences,
anecdotes.

635
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,335
And she can do that?

636
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:44,837
Sure, she can do it but it's risky.

637
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,465
Her slow pace keeps her from being able
to make as many points.

638
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:49,485
Therefore, in order for her
to win a competition...

639
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:50,551
Which she never has.

640
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,988
...Jasmine would have to show
that her own personal experiences

641
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:55,223
are, for some reason,
more important than facts.

642
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:58,851
Always stick to the facts.
Jasmine's fighting a losing battle.

643
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,561
Maybe she doesn't care if she wins.

644
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,125
[Newnan principal]
In just a moment, I'll be announcing

645
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,110
the names of our four finalists

646
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:10,113
who will go on to compete
for our state tournament this year.

647
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:13,074
But first,
we have a special guest speaker.

648
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,409
Ladies and gentlemen,

649
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:19,414
a few words from a debate mom
and our state senator, Julia Russell.

650
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:26,461
[Julia] Thank you.

651
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:30,675
I know you've been debating the pros
and cons of higher education all day,

652
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:31,926
and so I will be brief,

653
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,096
since I don't want to steal the spotlight
from the kids.

654
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,682
Yet she's literally stealing
the spotlight from the kids.

655
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:41,936
The Yale Alumni Association helped me
get my first job practicing law.

656
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,522
And so I started this foundation

657
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:48,151
so that I might be able to help others
with their start.

658
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:52,238
And today, our donors
include Oprah Winfrey...

659
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:55,950
- [scoffs]
- ...Bono, Mark Zuckerberg.

660
00:33:56,034 --> 00:34:01,330
And everyone who gets involved
always says the same thing.

661
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:03,958
- Stop dropping so many names?
- [crowd giggling]

662
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:08,046
[Julia] They say that their success
started with a work ethic

663
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,506
that began when they were your age.

664
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,967
The costs of listening to this woman
outweigh the benefits.

665
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:16,387
- [Julia] As you become more involved...
- Mom, stop it.

666
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:19,849
Sorry, it seems like there is
a distraction somewhere in the audience,

667
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:22,894
which probably means
I'm taking up too much time.

668
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,230
[Amy] My apologies, Senator.
I should've raised my hand.

669
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,190
[softly] My God.

670
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:31,360
I was just curious if you could give us
your definition of success.

671
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:33,779
That's a great question.

672
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:36,991
But, unfortunately, this is not a Q and A.

673
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:40,953
It's just the people you just listed
are all multi-billionaires.

674
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:45,625
So are you saying that type of wealth
is the best way to measure success?

675
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,919
[chuckles nervously]

676
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,296
[Julia] Full disclosure, everyone,

677
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:53,257
Amy Skinner and I
are old high school friends,

678
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:57,095
and so we like to jest with one another
from time to time.

679
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:59,097
Isn't that right, Amy?

680
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,140
I'm just asking about success.

681
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:03,392
Oh! And I have a great idea.

682
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,186
Why don't you come up here

683
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:08,231
and share with everyone
your success story?

684
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:10,775
I'm sure that these students
would love to hear all about it.

685
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:15,321
I mean, forgive me, I'm not entirely clear
on all the details myself, so...

686
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:19,200
No, thanks. I wouldn't want to steal
the spotlight from the kids.

687
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,618
[groans]

688
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,181
[Bennett]
They were the reason we didn't qualify.

689
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,039
[both sigh]

690
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:28,626
After Amy and Julia went at it,
the judges stopped the awards ceremony

691
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:31,838
and took five minutes to talk
before they announced the qualifiers.

692
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,089
It's not fair.

693
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:36,092
Have you ever considered the possibility
that sometimes you lose?

694
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:39,762
The same thing happened
in middle school. Twice.

695
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,430
Or sometimes you lose.

696
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:42,723
Not often.

697
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,101
Mr. Johnson said you have another shot
next month.

698
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:46,769
That's just for teams.

699
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,896
- And?
- And I don't have a partner.

700
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,980
Go with Lona.

701
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:52,441
[chuckles]
You're high on chocolate right now.

702
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:55,111
When I come to work high,
you'll know it.

703
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,571
Ask Debbie in Accounting.

704
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,197
We'd kill each other.

705
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:01,075
No. There is no possible way
that I'm gonna debate alongside the guy

706
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,679
who in the seventh grade
ripped pages out of my biology textbook

707
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:04,847
so I couldn't do my homework.

708
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:08,207
It's a fact that he is a dick to everyone
every day all the time.

709
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,501
That's a line we don't cross.
The dick line.

710
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:11,752
Don't cross the dick line.

711
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:15,631
We both should've qualified
as individuals. It's not fair.

712
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:18,092
- Or sometimes you lose.
- You know what I mean.

713
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,344
You should've seen
how dumb some of those kids were.

714
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:23,097
I'm sure they're talented.
Talented in their own way.

715
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,474
One of them didn't know
the capital of New Mexico.

716
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:26,976
Oh, that's embarrassing.

717
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,769
- Albuquerque.
- Santa Fe.

718
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:29,770
I know.

719
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,440
Listen, you're the two best debaters
in the county.

720
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:35,193
Together, you could qualify for State
and that's another thing

721
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:38,446
- you can send off to Harvard, right?
- [sighs]

722
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:41,649
- [Lona] You're wasting your time. We lost.
- [Bennett] Can you let me finish?

723
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:44,368
- The deadline passed.
- But we have the twins' slot.

724
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,054
- What happened to the twins?
- They dropped out.

725
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:47,455
- Of the tournament?
- Of the club.

726
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:48,915
[sighs]

727
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:50,790
[groans]

728
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:51,833
Lona, stop.

729
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,923
I need this for Yale.
And you want to get into Harvard.

730
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:59,634
- We already turned in our applications.
- [breathes out]

731
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:02,303
Come on, we both know
that the admissions office

732
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,472
will take into consideration
any honors we receive

733
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,724
- while they're making their decisions.
- [scoffs]

734
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,935
- We wouldn't qualify.
- [chuckles] Yes, we would.

735
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:12,396
- No, you have extremely bad habits.
- You disrespect your opponents.

736
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,607
- You disrespect the judges.
- You have bad breath.

737
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:17,109
- You have... Stupid face!
- A stupid face.

738
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,779
I think you meant to say
you have a stupid face.

739
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:22,865
No, actually,
I meant to say that you're a dick.

740
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,659
[laughs]

741
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,619
Do you... Do you think I want this?

742
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,462
- [scoffs] I certainly don't.
- Neither do I.

743
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:29,681
Out of everyone in this school,

744
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:31,785
you're literally the last person
I want to work with.

745
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:34,460
- The very, very last.
- Thank you.

746
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,671
You're egocentric,
you speed through crossfire

747
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,339
and you refuse to flow rounds.

748
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:41,884
I flow every single one of my rounds.

749
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:45,096
And for your information,
when you speed through crossfire,

750
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:47,574
you get through more questions
and you make the other team nervous.

751
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,517
No, I think you're right,
we wouldn't qualify.

752
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,061
- You're just not good enough.
- Oh, please.

753
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:54,414
I could carry us both through qualifiers
and state championship.

754
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,416
- You think we'd win?
- Yeah, if you got out of my way.

755
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,316
- Prove it.
- I will.

756
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,420
So it's agreed. You'll prove me wrong,
we'll play as a team, qualify next month,

757
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:01,612
and win the state tournament.

758
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,531
We'll start studying after school
at my place.

759
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:05,700
[indistinct chattering]

760
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:10,746
[birds chirping]

761
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,224
[Bennett] I'll give the opening statement.

762
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:14,583
No, I'm gonna give the opening statement.

763
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,395
Bennett, the round is one
of the first five minutes.

764
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,171
You make too many arguments
and don't impact any of them.

765
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:22,008
So we lose the round because of that.
In addition to that...

766
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,735
[Lona] If you did your work
for the amount of time

767
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,696
- you spend arguing with me...
- I'm already done.

768
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,930
I'm already done.
I already finished page two.

769
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:31,142
- [Lona] Well, start page three.
- [Bennett] There is no page three.

770
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,522
[Bennett] No. No.

771
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:37,606
- No, no.
- Stop.

772
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,524
[Bennett] Excuse me.

773
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:39,483
- [Lona] What?
- No.

774
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:42,254
Ask any teacher, they will tell you
that when you write something physically,

775
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,715
it sticks to your brain better
than when you do it on your computer.

776
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,366
[Bennett] Excuse me. Thank you.

777
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,428
- Condescending tone?
- Which the judges do not appreciate.

778
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,912
And besides,
it sets the tone for the entire round.

779
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:55,583
My judges appreciate my tone.
I have a very welcoming tone.

780
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,794
[Bennett and Lona speaking rapidly]

781
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,182
[sighs]

782
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,730
[Lona] Okay, enough, Picasso.
I'll make these last changes

783
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:19,482
- and email them to you.
- Or I can do it.

784
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,484
- No, I can do it.
- I can easily do it.

785
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,819
Yeah, you can easily do
a lot of things, Bennett.

786
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:25,696
[sighs]

787
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,740
Look, I'll make the changes
and see you tomorrow.

788
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:30,576
We're gonna do great.

789
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:33,245
[door closes]

790
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,705
[alarm ringing]

791
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:35,789
[sighs]

792
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:43,214
I know I've said it a thousand times,
but I really am sorry.

793
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,758
- It's fine, Mom.
- No, it's not.

794
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:48,469
I let Julia get under my tits,
and then I made it worse.

795
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,888
If I had just kept
my hilarious mouth shut,

796
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:52,611
you would've already qualified for State.

797
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,100
Or maybe I just lost that day.

798
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:56,936
Are you kidding me? Did you see
how stupid some of those kids were?

799
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,229
Talented.

800
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,356
In their own way.

801
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:06,195
Whoa! Take it easy with that stuff.
They won't even recognize you.

802
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:07,822
[groans]

803
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,698
Look, I'm just... I'm flustered, okay?

804
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,075
We have no chemistry.

805
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:14,036
We disagree in strategy,
we have opposite routines and I just...

806
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,454
I don't know how it's gonna work!

807
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:16,747
[sighs]

808
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,351
[Julia] I just wanted to tell you
that I spoke to the debate leadership

809
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:20,793
on the county and state levels

810
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:24,588
about Amy's primal impulses
and that unfortunate altercation.

811
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:27,216
And they assured me
that I was in the right, of course,

812
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:29,427
and that you would be judged fairly.

813
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,429
- Whatever.
- Well... No.

814
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,764
This is good news, Bennett.

815
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:37,452
You are going to qualify
for the state tournament today

816
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:40,229
and you are going to win
the state tournament.

817
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:42,731
And you will go to Yale in the fall.

818
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,876
But first, I have to compete
in the debate tournament

819
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,236
with a brand new partner
whom I've hated my entire life.

820
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:49,864
We all know who's carrying this team.

821
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,241
Goodbye, Mom.

822
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:54,160
[indistinct chattering]

00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:16,140
[cell phone ringing]

824
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:27,067
- Excuse me.
- Would you...?

825
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,653
[indistinct chattering]

826
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:32,537
We negate that the cost of college
education is outweighed by benefits.

827
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:38,704
We affirm the costs of a college
education are outweighed by the benefits.

828
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:42,541
[Lona continues speaking rapidly]

829
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:43,876
That's the right height.

830
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:45,437
Look at the difference of the height.

831
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:47,272
[Bennett] ...indicates college graduates
are more likely to earn higher salaries

832
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:49,173
pay more taxes, taxed at a higher rate...

833
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:51,133
[girl speaking rapidly]

834
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:54,821
- This is our area.
- Get it out of my area.

835
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,430
We're on a team. This is our area.

836
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:59,394
Without college educations, prospective
employees will be ill-equipped...

837
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,894
[stammers, then speaks rapidly]

838
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:05,105
That's why you must vote neg.

839
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,649
- [timer beeps]
- [clears throat]

840
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,111
[table squeaks]

841
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,866
Is anyone not ready?

842
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:17,493
[clears throat]

843
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,579
Our high school is inferior to yours.

844
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:23,666
[speaks Spanish]

845
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:25,501
We'd bet you money, if we had any.

846
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,503
[Dana]
We have no fancy research databases,

847
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:29,338
no personal laptop computers.

848
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:32,883
No debate coaches with
national championships on their résumé.

849
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:36,011
No, our debate coach works at Sears
on the weekends

850
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,680
- because he needs the money.
- [sighs]

851
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:39,974
So the moment that timer starts,

852
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:42,893
we're already ten steps behind
and are forced to play catch-up.

853
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,895
Well, we don't have to worry about them.

854
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,772
What? Why not?

855
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:48,524
They're good, really good.

856
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:52,236
This approach rarely wins. Replacing
feelings for facts is not debate.

857
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,612
The judges will see through it.

858
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,781
- Have you ever debated against it?
- Have you?

859
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:58,492
Jania Santos. Want to hear her story?

860
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,970
She was top of her high school class.

861
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:02,079
Went to a fancy liberal arts school
on the East Coast

862
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:04,623
and graduated
with a BA in European History.

863
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:06,307
[Jasmine]
And guess what she's doing now?

864
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:07,251
[Dana speaking in Spanish]

865
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:08,168
Sears.

866
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,254
She's working at Sears
with our debate coach!

867
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:12,232
You know, what are these colleges
really offering

868
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,008
if they're not offering careers?

869
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,801
- It's bullshit!
- It's bullshit!

870
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:19,221
All I'm saying is how do we prepare
to debate someone's personal experiences?

871
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:20,991
There's no way
to anticipate what they'll say.

872
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,615
No. We dismiss it as contrary
to the framework of the debate topic

873
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:26,162
and the judges will agree
that what they're saying is meaningless.

874
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:28,480
You think what they're saying
is meaningless?

875
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:30,858
I think that the facts will always win
and you do, too.

876
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:35,613
[speaking rapidly]

[school bell ringing]

878
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,036
[Kathy] See what I told you?

879
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,472
Honestly, they shouldn't even
give a trophy for a qualifier.

880
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:45,414
You can have it.

881
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:47,333
You earned it. Give yourself a break.

882
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:50,294
- [groans] I don't have time for breaks.
- You're nervous, aren't you?

883
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:52,796
- About State?
- No, about getting into Harvard.

884
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,964
It's this Friday.

885
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,650
- You told them you qualified?
- Yeah, I did.

886
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:58,427
You're a four-time qualifier.
That's amazing!

887
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,095
Yeah, but am I gonna get in?

888
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,656
- You'll do great.
- You don't know that.

889
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,848
They'd be lucky to have you.

890
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:04,534
Look, Harvard has a five percent
acceptance rate.

891
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:07,353
That means that there's a 95 percent
chance that I don't get in.

892
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:09,188
- Maybe you're different.
- Maybe I'm not.

893
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:10,391
Maybe I'm not any different.

894
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:13,567
Maybe I'm just another robot
who spends too much time in the library.

895
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:16,654
- Is that really what you think?
- I don't know and neither do you.

896
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,240
Okay.

897
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,661
Fine.

898
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:24,578
You're right.

899
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:25,496
[sighs]

900
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:29,249
It doesn't look good.
In fact, it looks pretty shitty.

901
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:32,711
We're talking about Harvard, so the odds
are clearly stacked against you

902
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,672
and it's more than likely
you'll be rejected.

903
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:37,508
Is that better?

904
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:39,885
Lona, I don't have a clue
where you're gonna end up.

905
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:41,220
Not in a year.

906
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:43,639
Not ten years from now.

907
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:45,891
We don't know what's gonna happen.
Nobody does.

908
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,979
No matter where you go,
will you promise me something?

909
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,231
What?

910
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:53,899
You're not gonna like it.

911
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:59,988
In fact, many extremely successful people
will completely disagree with me.

912
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:04,535
I don't know. I hesitate
to even bring it up. Maybe I'll just...

913
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:05,818
Where are you going with this?

914
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:10,707
When I started working here,

915
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:12,917
that wall was empty.

916
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:18,132
That bookcase was empty.

917
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:23,679
And then kids like you left.

918
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:28,183
And they got into their dream school,
or they didn't.

919
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:32,020
But all of them went on to do stuff.

920
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:34,231
Make stuff.

921
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:36,692
And so they sent me stuff.

922
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:42,364
And I'm not sure
but I think that's a life.

923
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:49,204
Wherever you end up, kiddo,

924
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:51,498
have fun.

01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:49,485
[upbeat music plays]

1420
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:09,903
- That is why must vote neg.
- That is why you must vote aff.

1421
01:15:11,381 --> 01:15:12,799
In a two-to-one decision,

1422
01:15:13,383 --> 01:15:16,720
from Hemlock Prep Academy,
Lona Skinner and Bennett Russell.

1423
01:15:16,803 --> 01:15:18,472
[applauding]

1424
01:15:22,434 --> 01:15:24,228
Good evening, everyone.

1425
01:15:24,811 --> 01:15:26,813
Welcome to the final debate.

1426
01:15:26,897 --> 01:15:29,775
Who will be named
the best team in the state?

1427
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:31,944
You're about to find out.

1428
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:36,657
First, from Hemlock Prep Academy,
Bennett Russell and Lona Skinner.

1429
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:39,535
[crowd applauding]

1430
01:15:41,328 --> 01:15:45,624
And from Washington High,
Jasmine Spencer and Dana Martinez.

1431
01:15:45,707 --> 01:15:47,918
[crowd applauding]

1432
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:50,745
[woman] Good luck to you both.

1433
01:15:51,838 --> 01:15:53,632
And now, let's begin.

1434
01:16:04,184 --> 01:16:05,811
- [Jasmine sighs]
- Is anybody not ready?

1435
01:16:07,187 --> 01:16:08,187
[timer beeps]

1436
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:10,291
Do you know what I did this morning?
I pinched myself.

1437
01:16:10,315 --> 01:16:11,149
- [chuckles]
- I know, right?

1438
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:15,028
It's a cliché, but I thought I was
dreaming. We shouldn't be up here.

1439
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:17,990
Take a look around the room,
and then look at us.

1440
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:19,783
[Dana speaks Spanish]

1441
01:16:19,866 --> 01:16:21,326
We shouldn't be here.

1442
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:23,245
No, we deserve it,
but we shouldn't be here

1443
01:16:23,328 --> 01:16:25,122
because we should be working.

1444
01:16:25,205 --> 01:16:29,251
The truth is we can't afford to be here
and we don't want to be here.

1445
01:16:29,334 --> 01:16:32,713
[Jasmine] I mean, honestly,
do any of you really want to be here?

1446
01:16:32,796 --> 01:16:36,133
Do you actually enjoy giving up
your Saturdays to debate public policy?

1447
01:16:36,216 --> 01:16:37,216
Hell, no.

1448
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:40,095
But since you were born into privilege,
you're expected to, right?

1449
01:16:40,178 --> 01:16:41,823
- [speaks Spanish]
- That's just messed up,

1450
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:43,056
both for you and me.

1451
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:45,225
So, what do we affirm?

1452
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:46,935
Our aff is that this process, no,

1453
01:16:47,019 --> 01:16:50,814
this business of college admissions
outweighs the benefits.

1454
01:16:50,897 --> 01:16:52,107
And it is so overbearing

1455
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:55,110
that it's turning young people
into robots,

1456
01:16:55,193 --> 01:16:59,489
forcing us to make critical decisions
about our future at the age of 16.

1457
01:16:59,573 --> 01:17:01,283
- [speaks Spanish]
- Are you kidding me?

1458
01:17:01,366 --> 01:17:04,536
I mean, just think about it.
I can't vote or drink,

1459
01:17:04,745 --> 01:17:07,456
and yet my entire adult life

1460
01:17:07,539 --> 01:17:11,668
is dependent upon my GPA,
AP courses, and community service?

1461
01:17:11,752 --> 01:17:13,045
You know our story by now.

1462
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:16,548
You know that our families
actually need the money.

1463
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:19,468
You're asking me if college is worth it.

1464
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:22,679
The better question is,
"Who is helping me? Who is helping us?"

1465
01:17:22,763 --> 01:17:26,808
Where is the priority of getting
low-income students through high school?

1466
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:28,977
- Because we don't see it.
- We don't see it.

1467
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:31,855
[crowd applauding, cheering]

1468
01:17:40,405 --> 01:17:41,845
- [paper rustling]
- [chair creaking]

1469
01:17:50,248 --> 01:17:52,250
[Lona] Hey, Bennett,
can I have the notes, please?

1470
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:53,334
Thanks.

1471
01:17:57,839 --> 01:17:59,132
[man coughs]

1472
01:17:59,716 --> 01:18:01,802
Is anyone not ready?

1473
01:18:11,103 --> 01:18:11,937
[beeps]

1474
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:13,873
Bennett and I negate
the costs of a college education

1475
01:18:13,897 --> 01:18:15,232
outweigh the benefits.

1476
01:18:15,315 --> 01:18:18,235
Our first contention is that
our opponents, in their opening statement,

1477
01:18:18,318 --> 01:18:21,154
have shown complete disregard
for the topic, and thus, the frame...

1478
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:22,465
the framework in which we debate.

1479
01:18:22,489 --> 01:18:24,741
Their blatant disrespect...

1480
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:27,536
[gasps]

1481
01:18:33,792 --> 01:18:35,085
[sighs]

1482
01:18:35,836 --> 01:18:37,337
[man] Oh.

1483
01:18:59,359 --> 01:19:00,652
[sighs]

1484
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:01,736
[Lona] You know what?

1485
01:19:03,238 --> 01:19:04,656
Jasmine and Dana are right.

1486
01:19:06,616 --> 01:19:07,951
We are robots.

1487
01:19:09,828 --> 01:19:12,539
Let me tell you a story.

1488
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:17,169
Getting into college sucks.

1489
01:19:17,252 --> 01:19:20,338
Well, I shouldn't say that
because I haven't gotten in yet.

1490
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:26,928
But I've spent the last 18 years
researching, writing, and debating

1491
01:19:27,012 --> 01:19:29,306
both sides of every argument.

1492
01:19:29,389 --> 01:19:34,519
I can speak at 400 words per minute
and cram as many facts as humanly possible

1493
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:37,022
into each round
before that buzzer goes off.

1494
01:19:37,731 --> 01:19:41,818
I did everything I thought
I needed to do, and...

1495
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:46,280
what happened?

1496
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:54,331
It resulted in a big fat rejection letter.

1497
01:19:54,748 --> 01:19:55,748
[chuckles]

1498
01:19:56,166 --> 01:19:59,085
Facts over feelings, right?

1499
01:20:00,253 --> 01:20:01,588
Is that a good idea?

1500
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:06,134
I'm at a loss.

1501
01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:07,219
[scoffs]

1502
01:20:08,053 --> 01:20:09,930
[stammers] I am.

1503
01:20:10,013 --> 01:20:13,809
Because maybe I will be a politician
or a lawyer someday

1504
01:20:13,892 --> 01:20:15,560
and these Saturdays
will have provided me

1505
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:19,523
with some skill set that I could not
attain anywhere else, but...

1506
01:20:22,567 --> 01:20:23,944
what if I'm unable to...

1507
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:35,372
What if I'm unable
to form a human connection?

1508
01:20:36,915 --> 01:20:38,083
[breathes out]

1509
01:20:42,045 --> 01:20:43,045
[scoffs]

1510
01:21:00,647 --> 01:21:01,647
[Bennett clears throat]

1511
01:21:02,816 --> 01:21:04,752
Raise your hand
if you can articulate the arguments

1512
01:21:04,776 --> 01:21:06,903
that Lona and I have been arguing today.

1513
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:19,249
Now raise your hand if you can understand
what Jasmine and Dana have been saying.

1514
01:21:28,592 --> 01:21:30,719
They've been doing this all year,
just like us.

1515
01:21:32,512 --> 01:21:33,722
But they're nothing like us.

1516
01:21:35,682 --> 01:21:38,852
Because they didn't choose to focus
on the pressure to win that we did.

1517
01:21:39,603 --> 01:21:41,323
Instead they chose
something more important,

1518
01:21:42,397 --> 01:21:43,607
communicating.

1519
01:21:46,234 --> 01:21:48,194
Next year scares the shit out of me.

1520
01:21:48,987 --> 01:21:50,071
[crowd chuckles]

1521
01:21:50,155 --> 01:21:51,795
[Bennett] I don't know where I'll end up,

1522
01:21:51,865 --> 01:21:55,785
or what I'm going to do,
or what I'll become.

1523
01:21:56,953 --> 01:21:58,413
But as of right now...

1524
01:21:59,414 --> 01:22:00,665
I'm happy to be here.

1525
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:04,002
And maybe it was all worth it,

1526
01:22:04,085 --> 01:22:08,048
just to see you two come in here
and free the robots.

1527
01:22:08,131 --> 01:22:10,300
[crowd chuckles]

1528
01:22:11,801 --> 01:22:14,179
So that we would stop
talking at each other,

1529
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:16,348
and start talking to each other.

1530
01:22:24,230 --> 01:22:26,650
[timer beeping]

1531
01:22:33,865 --> 01:22:34,865
Thanks.

1532
01:22:58,264 --> 01:23:00,809
[crowd applauding]

1533
01:23:03,645 --> 01:23:05,939
Thank you, everyone. This is it.

1534
01:23:08,149 --> 01:23:09,985
In a 2-1 decision,

1535
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:12,237
your state champions,

1536
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:16,908
from Washington High,
Jasmine Spencer and Dana Martinez.

1537
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:19,369
[crowd applauding]

1538
01:23:24,290 --> 01:23:25,542
Sometimes we lose.

1539

[birds chirping]

1540
01:23:39,472 --> 01:23:40,849
[school bell ringing]

1541
01:23:42,767 --> 01:23:45,979
[Mr. Johnson] Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Debate Club.

1542
01:23:46,062 --> 01:23:51,359
The first rule of Debate Club is,
you do not talk about Debate Club.

1543
01:23:51,443 --> 01:23:56,865
The second rule of Debate Club is,
you do not talk about Debate Club.

1544
01:23:56,948 --> 01:23:59,784
The third rule is,
if someone yells "stop",

1545
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:03,246
goes limp, or tags out,
the debate is over.

1546
01:24:03,329 --> 01:24:05,165
- Brad Pitt.
- In Fight Club.

1547
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:07,709
Thank you, Taylor and Tanner.

1548
01:24:07,792 --> 01:24:08,877
Once more from the top.

1549
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:13,673
The first rule of Debate Club is,
you do not talk about Debate Club.

1550
01:24:13,757 --> 01:24:15,884
[birds chirping]

1551
01:24:17,886 --> 01:24:19,763
[eraser rustling]

1552
01:24:24,434 --> 01:24:25,894
[Lona sighs]

1553
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:39,616
I can feel you watching me, Mom.

1554
01:24:39,699 --> 01:24:41,910
Sorry for being excited for you.

1555
01:24:41,993 --> 01:24:45,830
- It's just another dance.
- It's your last dance.

1556
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:46,914
It's prom.

1557
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:51,252
I know you've been all grown up
ever since I gave birth to you,

1558
01:24:51,336 --> 01:24:53,922
but I hate to tell you this,

1559
01:24:54,005 --> 01:24:57,383
life after high school
is just a series of disappointments.

1560
01:24:57,467 --> 01:24:59,803
[scoffs] You always know just what to say.

1561
01:25:00,637 --> 01:25:01,888
'Cause I love you.

1562
01:25:01,971 --> 01:25:04,724
I love you, too.
Now let me finish getting ready, please.

1563
01:25:06,684 --> 01:25:07,894
[sighs]

1564
01:25:10,188 --> 01:25:12,816
The day has arrived

1565
01:25:12,899 --> 01:25:14,734
Fresh off the ironing board.

1566
01:25:14,818 --> 01:25:16,236
[both chuckle]

1567
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:19,197
[Julia]
Oh, my gosh. Let me take a look at you.

1568
01:25:22,992 --> 01:25:24,452
Take pictures, okay?

1569
01:25:24,536 --> 01:25:27,497
- For you or your campaign?
- Hey.

1570
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:29,624
Very funny. For you.

1571
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:32,127
[Julia chuckles]

1572
01:25:32,210 --> 01:25:35,255
This is one of those life moments, right?

1573
01:25:35,338 --> 01:25:38,550
You're going to college for four years,
and two years of law school,

1574
01:25:38,633 --> 01:25:40,914
and then you're gonna be working
14-hour days in your 20s,

1575
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:42,220
so you really just got...

1576
01:25:42,303 --> 01:25:44,264
Relax.

1577
01:25:44,347 --> 01:25:45,347
Relax.

1578
01:25:45,765 --> 01:25:46,765
Exactly.

1579
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:48,226
- [sighs]
- Uh...

1580
01:25:48,309 --> 01:25:49,328
You want me to call a limo?

1581
01:25:49,352 --> 01:25:50,704
- Then you can have a driver.
- No.

1582
01:25:50,728 --> 01:25:52,540
- You could stay out all night.
- I don't need a limo.

1583
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:54,649
I have a car that works.

1584
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:56,233
I know.

1585
01:25:57,861 --> 01:25:59,362
I'll be home by midnight.

1586
01:26:01,406 --> 01:26:03,324
One o'clock is fine.

1587
01:26:04,784 --> 01:26:05,784
12:30.

1588
01:26:07,203 --> 01:26:09,038
[birds chirping]

1589
01:26:12,625 --> 01:26:14,252
[breathes out]

1590
01:26:17,255 --> 01:26:18,965
[door opening]

1591
01:26:19,048 --> 01:26:22,135
[upbeat music playing]

1592
01:26:32,353 --> 01:26:33,354
Here you go.

1593
01:26:34,814 --> 01:26:36,399
And congratulations.

1594
01:26:39,611 --> 01:26:40,528
You look good in red.

1595
01:26:40,612 --> 01:26:42,280
- It's crimson.
- Oh, shut up.

1596
01:26:42,947 --> 01:26:44,267
[Bennett] Congratulations to you.

1597
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:46,409
I always thought
you were a bit of a Bulldog.

1598
01:26:46,492 --> 01:26:48,203
I didn't even know what their mascot was.

1599
01:26:48,286 --> 01:26:50,830
[chuckles] You're gonna go
to so many football games.

1600
01:26:50,914 --> 01:26:52,749
And so many parties.

1601
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:55,710
Nah, not really.

1602
01:26:56,753 --> 01:26:58,338
One popcorn, one soda.

1603
01:26:58,421 --> 01:27:02,300
And during this evening's performance
will you be enjoying some candy?

1604
01:27:03,426 --> 01:27:08,056
Yes. We will have
some Reese's Pieces, please.

1605
01:27:08,139 --> 01:27:09,390
- And Milk Duds.
- And Whoppers.

1606
01:27:09,474 --> 01:27:11,809
- [Bennett] And let me get a KitKat.
- And Twizzlers.

1607
01:27:11,893 --> 01:27:14,646
- Let me get the Good and Plenty.
- And some Jolly Ranchers as well.

1608
01:27:14,729 --> 01:27:16,606
And that Mr. Goodbar.

1609
01:27:16,689 --> 01:27:19,025
- [slurps]
- [man speaking on screen]

1610
01:27:19,108 --> 01:27:20,108
Wait for it.

1611
01:27:24,864 --> 01:27:26,991
No. I am not eating
out of that sweaty hat

1612
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:28,451
that's been on your sweaty head.

1613
01:27:28,534 --> 01:27:29,619
My head is not sweaty.

1614
01:27:29,702 --> 01:27:31,788
Your head is sweaty, and so is your hat.

1615
01:27:31,871 --> 01:27:34,916
- And now our candy is contaminated.
- Contaminated?

1616
01:27:34,999 --> 01:27:37,460
Absolutely,
at least on a microscopic level.

1617
01:27:37,543 --> 01:27:40,338
So by that rationale
we should never hold hands.

1618
01:27:40,421 --> 01:27:42,131
[scoffs] You don't want that.

1619
01:27:43,383 --> 01:27:45,301
No. You don't want that.

1620
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:48,429
[Lona] Look at him.

1621
01:27:49,013 --> 01:27:52,016
Look at that smug look on his smug face.

1622
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:53,518
He thinks that we're a couple.

1623
01:27:55,061 --> 01:27:57,146
He thinks we have a thing going.

1624
01:27:57,230 --> 01:28:00,733
He has no sense that in just a few months
we'll go our separate ways,

1625
01:28:00,817 --> 01:28:02,902
probably lose contact,
gain the freshman 15,

1626
01:28:02,986 --> 01:28:05,530
and jump head first back into studying.

1627
01:28:05,613 --> 01:28:09,409
He thinks I actually like him.
Don't you, Bennett Russell?

1628
01:28:09,993 --> 01:28:11,327
You think I like you?

1629
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:13,454
[Lona scoffs]

1630
01:28:13,538 --> 01:28:14,539
Well, damn it.

1631
01:28:15,915 --> 01:28:17,041
You might be right.

1632
01:28:18,126 --> 01:28:19,126
[Bennett moans]

1633
01:28:19,544 --> 01:28:21,087
- Mm?
- Mm-hm.

1634
01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:23,756
- Yeah, I know. It's awesome.
- You want some?

1635
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:25,091
I actually do want some.

1636
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:27,343
[man] Shut up.

1637
01:28:27,427 --> 01:28:29,095
- Oh.
- [chuckles]

1638
