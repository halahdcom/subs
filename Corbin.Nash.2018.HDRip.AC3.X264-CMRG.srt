<i>Please, God,</i>

3
00:00:30,704 --> 00:00:33,572
<i>send him an angel of light,</i>

4
00:00:33,574 --> 00:00:35,477
<i>protect him from darkness.</i>

5
00:01:04,537 --> 00:01:06,938
<i>This is a city of sinners</i>

6
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,609
<i>and far worse</i>

7
00:01:09,677 --> 00:01:14,279
<i>where the damned and
the forsaken walk the streets.</i>

8
00:01:14,281 --> 00:01:15,646
<i>Somebody's taken my son!</i>

9
00:01:15,648 --> 00:01:16,982
<i>Please help me!</i>

10
00:01:16,984 --> 00:01:19,618
<i>Calm down, ma'am.
Can you tell me where you are?</i>

11
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,651
<i>The angels...</i>

12
00:01:22,623 --> 00:01:25,223
<i>...they left a long time ago.</i>

13
00:01:25,225 --> 00:01:26,458
<i>He's into my home!</i>

14
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,493
<i>She's dead!
He killed my wife!</i>

15
00:01:28,495 --> 00:01:29,860
<i>Police are on their way.</i>

16
00:01:29,862 --> 00:01:31,429
<i>Please, try to remain calm, sir.</i>

17
00:01:31,431 --> 00:01:33,532
<i>The Lord
has prepared his people</i>

18
00:01:33,534 --> 00:01:35,333
<i>for a great slaughter</i>

19
00:01:35,335 --> 00:01:37,603
<i>This guy is dead
for sure, ma'am.</i>

20
00:01:37,605 --> 00:01:41,306
<i>And He has
chosen their executioners.</i>

21
00:01:41,308 --> 00:01:43,541
<i>The guy is
still unconscious.</i>

22
00:01:43,543 --> 00:01:45,309
<i>There's fucking blood all over!</i>

23
00:01:45,311 --> 00:01:47,781
<i>There are
those whose teeth are swords,</i>

24
00:01:49,582 --> 00:01:52,286
<i>whose fangs are knives,</i>

25
00:01:53,954 --> 00:01:57,823
<i>put here to devour the
weak from off the earth.</i>

26
00:01:59,892 --> 00:02:03,331
<i>Their blood will be
poured out into the dust</i>

27
00:02:04,698 --> 00:02:09,000
<i>and their bodies will lay
rotting on the ground.</i>

28
00:02:11,605 --> 00:02:13,504
<i>And no wonder,</i>

29
00:02:13,506 --> 00:02:16,874
<i>for even Satan disguises himself</i>

30
00:02:16,876 --> 00:02:18,843
<i>as an angel of light.</i>

31
00:02:20,648 --> 00:02:22,713
<i>Though light survives</i>

32
00:02:22,715 --> 00:02:26,787
<i>and the battle between
good and evil persists,</i>

33
00:02:28,922 --> 00:02:30,758
<i>angel or demon,</i>

34
00:02:31,725 --> 00:02:35,427
<i>all will appear before
the Judgment seat of God.</i>

35
00:02:35,429 --> 00:02:37,528
<i>Please, my brother.</i>

36
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,730
<i>Yet blessed are the merciful...</i>

37
00:02:39,732 --> 00:02:40,998
<i>The window is broken.</i>

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,034
<i>...for they shall
receive mercy...</i>

39
00:02:43,036 --> 00:02:44,903
<i>He's got...</i>

40
00:02:44,905 --> 00:02:48,473
<i>...so that all may
receive what is due.</i>

41
00:02:48,475 --> 00:02:49,874
<i>If you could tell
me your name and location,</i>

42
00:02:49,876 --> 00:02:51,510
<i>we're going to dispatch
an officer to your area.</i>

43
00:02:51,512 --> 00:02:53,378
<i>And be saved.</i>

44
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,580
<i>Uhm... Uhm...</i>

45
00:02:55,582 --> 00:02:56,851
<i>My name is Macy.</i>

46
00:02:59,553 --> 00:03:02,486
<i>Of those who
have sinned against the Lord,</i>

47
00:03:02,488 --> 00:03:05,891
<i>I will make you as
helpless as a blind man</i>

48
00:03:05,893 --> 00:03:07,859
<i>searching for a path.</i>

49
00:03:11,364 --> 00:03:13,900
<i>As it's only in the darkness</i>

50
00:03:14,968 --> 00:03:17,272
<i>that we find ourselves</i>

51
00:03:20,374 --> 00:03:23,474
<i>or find our Maker's wrath.</i>

52
00:04:03,383 --> 00:04:04,749
Help!

53
00:04:04,751 --> 00:04:08,687
Help! Somebody help me!

54
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:09,691
Oh, my God!

55
00:04:13,393 --> 00:04:14,761
Oh, my God, it's you.

56
00:04:17,731 --> 00:04:19,334
Who did this to you?

57
00:04:21,034 --> 00:04:22,567
Drake.

58
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:23,604
Who?

59
00:04:28,976 --> 00:04:30,478
Help me.

60
00:04:31,411 --> 00:04:32,911
You can help him.

61
00:04:32,913 --> 00:04:35,450
But you can't save him, Macy.

62
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:39,053
He doesn't need a hospital,
he needs a priest.

63
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,426
He's going to die.

64
00:05:30,637 --> 00:05:31,672
Put it down.

65
00:05:47,788 --> 00:05:49,424
Tough break, shooter.

66
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:51,892
Next time.

67
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:55,626
There ain't going
to be no next time.

68
00:05:55,628 --> 00:05:56,797
And I'm walking.

69
00:05:59,632 --> 00:06:02,000
Hey, you got two
strikes against you.

70
00:06:02,002 --> 00:06:03,471
Don't do anything stupid.

71
00:06:11,577 --> 00:06:12,579
Thanks.

72
00:06:22,856 --> 00:06:23,990
Well...

73
00:06:25,158 --> 00:06:27,128
it makes you better,
you know, Corbin,

74
00:06:28,628 --> 00:06:32,531
especially when pieces
of shit like this get away,

75
00:06:32,533 --> 00:06:35,236
it's a hard thing, but it
does make us better, so.

76
00:06:36,702 --> 00:06:38,236
- Better?
- Mm-Mm.

77
00:06:38,238 --> 00:06:39,303
I should have fucking shot him.

78
00:06:39,305 --> 00:06:41,709
We could've shot him.

79
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:18,245
Jack.

80
00:07:38,764 --> 00:07:39,800
Who are you?

81
00:07:41,767 --> 00:07:43,236
I'm a friend of the family.

82
00:07:44,837 --> 00:07:46,006
I got no family.

83
00:07:49,108 --> 00:07:51,912
I see Jack's got you
in a tight leash.

84
00:07:53,846 --> 00:07:55,716
Yeah, he's a good man,

85
00:07:57,216 --> 00:07:58,752
but he's not your father.

86
00:08:00,954 --> 00:08:02,323
How did you know I'll be here?

87
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,027
You following me?

88
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,262
It's not a good idea.

89
00:08:10,731 --> 00:08:13,063
It's not difficult
to spot a wolf

90
00:08:13,065 --> 00:08:15,101
in a flock of sheep, kid.

91
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,105
You should have shot him.

92
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:22,342
We have a few things
in common, you and I.

93
00:08:23,844 --> 00:08:24,844
Yeah?

94
00:08:26,012 --> 00:08:28,248
Yeah. We like guns.

95
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:32,587
Looks old.

96
00:08:33,353 --> 00:08:34,655
Belonged to your father.

97
00:08:35,855 --> 00:08:37,624
He never used it on people.

98
00:08:38,691 --> 00:08:39,726
You knew my father?

99
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,830
Yeah. And your sweet mother.

100
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:47,101
My parents are dead.

101
00:08:50,436 --> 00:08:52,072
You know anything about them?

102
00:08:55,142 --> 00:08:58,108
My mother was Irish,
my father played ball.

103
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,879
He won the World Series, kid.

104
00:09:00,881 --> 00:09:02,016
Yeah, he did.

105
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:05,784
The thing was that being
a baseball player

106
00:09:05,786 --> 00:09:07,220
was just a cover.

107
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,020
Cover for what?

108
00:09:10,022 --> 00:09:12,926
The battle with
demons and destiny.

109
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,129
Demons, huh?

110
00:09:17,363 --> 00:09:18,365
Okay.

111
00:09:19,366 --> 00:09:21,669
The never-ending fight

112
00:09:22,735 --> 00:09:24,270
between good and evil.

113
00:09:25,372 --> 00:09:29,644
Your parents came from
a long line of hunters.

114
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:33,280
You're one of them.

115
00:09:37,983 --> 00:09:39,387
What's you looking
for ain't here?

116
00:09:40,786 --> 00:09:42,422
- No?
- No.

117
00:09:43,323 --> 00:09:45,823
It's three blocks down on East.

118
00:09:45,825 --> 00:09:47,424
It's called the
fucking hospital.

119
00:09:52,898 --> 00:09:55,001
You're my last rodeo, kid.

120
00:09:56,302 --> 00:09:57,737
I'm almost done.

121
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:04,712
Your parents were
killed in Los Angeles.

122
00:10:06,213 --> 00:10:08,011
Your dad was there for the game.

123
00:10:08,013 --> 00:10:10,414
But like I said, he was hunting.

124
00:10:13,018 --> 00:10:14,885
They were slaughtered.

125
00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:17,725
It's the truth, Corbin.

126
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:20,958
What... what are you doing?

127
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,261
I didn't want to tell you
because I wanted to protect you.

128
00:10:24,263 --> 00:10:25,765
It's who they were.

129
00:10:26,932 --> 00:10:28,832
What the fuck is this?

130
00:10:28,834 --> 00:10:30,204
You need to listen to him.

131
00:10:33,406 --> 00:10:34,406
I was there.

132
00:10:36,776 --> 00:10:40,544
Our mission was to
kill their royal blood.

133
00:10:40,546 --> 00:10:42,780
Two brothers.

134
00:10:42,782 --> 00:10:44,050
We got one.

135
00:10:44,984 --> 00:10:47,519
The other one, Drake, got away.

136
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,453
What you're saying is insane!

137
00:10:48,455 --> 00:10:50,989
Drake was behind it
from the beginning.

138
00:10:50,991 --> 00:10:53,491
- You're fucking insane.
- You were the big secret.

139
00:10:53,493 --> 00:10:56,162
You were kept away
from all this evil.

140
00:10:59,299 --> 00:11:02,066
Drake doesn't even
know you exist.

141
00:11:02,068 --> 00:11:03,967
Then why does it matter?

142
00:11:03,969 --> 00:11:05,970
My parents are dead.

143
00:11:05,972 --> 00:11:08,242
And no fucking fairytale
is going to bring them back.

144
00:11:12,845 --> 00:11:14,080
It's your time.

145
00:11:16,349 --> 00:11:19,085
Your dad would want
you to have this.

146
00:11:25,057 --> 00:11:26,259
Godspeed.

147
00:11:35,535 --> 00:11:37,836
It's too soon.

148
00:11:37,838 --> 00:11:40,775
It's history, Jack. And
it's a damn good start.

149
00:12:49,508 --> 00:12:51,845
No!

150
00:12:52,945 --> 00:12:54,214
No!

151
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,069
Shit don't make any sense.

152
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,472
It's all too random.

153
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,310
There's no motive.

154
00:13:58,511 --> 00:13:59,914
Whole thing is spooky.

155
00:14:05,352 --> 00:14:06,487
Motherfucker.

156
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,422
Friend of yours?

157
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,159
Disease, my ass.

158
00:14:16,061 --> 00:14:18,029
Fucking guy raped
a seven-year-old girl

159
00:14:18,031 --> 00:14:20,000
but he got off
on a technicality.

160
00:14:22,102 --> 00:14:24,038
Makes you wonder
if what we even do matters.

161
00:14:26,705 --> 00:14:28,274
Un-fucking-believable.

162
00:14:29,275 --> 00:14:30,209
Right?

163
00:14:32,045 --> 00:14:34,147
If it was my daughter, I would
have killed the sick bastard.

164
00:14:35,415 --> 00:14:36,650
At least put him down.

165
00:14:48,127 --> 00:14:49,729
You think there's more
than one guy doing this?

166
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:56,303
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

167
00:14:57,737 --> 00:14:59,272
We just need to find them.

168
00:15:09,748 --> 00:15:14,053
<i>I am beautiful.</i>

169
00:15:24,664 --> 00:15:26,100
I am...

170
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,369
...an angel.

171
00:15:31,171 --> 00:15:32,736
I am...

172
00:15:32,738 --> 00:15:37,074
...a cold-blooded
fucking killer.

173
00:15:41,448 --> 00:15:44,184
Everybody wants to fuck me.

174
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:53,493
Mm...

175
00:15:59,165 --> 00:16:00,398
Chase it.

176
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:32,130
- Ooh, you like that, baby?
- Oh, yes.

177
00:16:32,132 --> 00:16:33,798
- Yeah?
- Ah-Huh.

178
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,467
- You think I'm beautiful?
- I think you're so beautiful.

179
00:16:36,469 --> 00:16:38,169
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

180
00:16:38,171 --> 00:16:41,338
- You think I'm sexy?
- You're so sexy, baby.

181
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,241
Yeah, baby!

182
00:16:45,445 --> 00:16:46,446
You like that?

183
00:16:47,347 --> 00:16:50,414
- Yes. Oh, yes!
- Yeah. You like it, huh?

184
00:16:55,588 --> 00:16:57,755
Yeah. Tell me I'm beautiful.

185
00:16:57,757 --> 00:17:00,223
You're so beautiful, baby.

186
00:17:00,225 --> 00:17:03,427
Ah-Huh. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

187
00:17:03,429 --> 00:17:04,698
Tell me you love me!

188
00:17:05,664 --> 00:17:07,564
I love you, baby.

189
00:17:07,566 --> 00:17:08,698
I love you.

190
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,269
Now look at me.

191
00:17:11,371 --> 00:17:12,605
Look at me.

192
00:17:46,738 --> 00:17:48,741
What's this? What the
fuck is going on?

193
00:17:51,411 --> 00:17:53,276
- I'm just trying to help.
- Help?

194
00:17:53,278 --> 00:17:54,680
Why am I chained to a bed?

195
00:17:56,783 --> 00:17:58,651
Because someone
I trust told me to.

196
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,686
For protection.

197
00:18:01,688 --> 00:18:04,725
- I don't need protection.
- Not yours.

198
00:18:06,593 --> 00:18:07,494
Mine.

199
00:18:08,527 --> 00:18:10,794
Shh.

200
00:18:10,796 --> 00:18:11,864
Why are you doing this?

201
00:18:16,969 --> 00:18:18,671
You don't remember me, do you?

202
00:18:39,992 --> 00:18:41,427
We met before.

203
00:18:46,966 --> 00:18:48,368
At the bar.

204
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:54,708
<i>I was in trouble.</i>

205
00:18:59,578 --> 00:19:01,512
<i>You saved me.</i>

206
00:19:23,936 --> 00:19:25,005
<i>After that,</i>

207
00:19:26,072 --> 00:19:28,072
I asked around

208
00:19:28,074 --> 00:19:29,743
and they just told
me who you were.

209
00:19:31,811 --> 00:19:34,481
You're that detective
working on the missing cases.

210
00:19:40,385 --> 00:19:42,021
My brother is missing.

211
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:53,933
Yo, Mace.

212
00:19:57,903 --> 00:19:59,640
Shit. What's up, girl?

213
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,605
What do you want?

214
00:20:02,607 --> 00:20:04,975
I came to see you.
Came to see my girl.

215
00:20:04,977 --> 00:20:07,777
I'm not your girl, okay.
You were a mistake.

216
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:09,449
- Now leave me alone.
- Mistake!

217
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:11,582
Come on, babe.

218
00:20:11,584 --> 00:20:13,817
I miss my baby, man.

219
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:16,019
Don't fucking touch me.

220
00:20:16,021 --> 00:20:16,922
Go!

221
00:20:18,123 --> 00:20:19,989
Shit! Come on outside.

222
00:20:19,991 --> 00:20:22,560
Leave it alone, Karl. Go!

223
00:20:22,562 --> 00:20:23,729
Oh!

224
00:20:25,465 --> 00:20:26,433
Macy.

225
00:20:27,566 --> 00:20:29,899
Open the fucking door!
What the fuck is wrong with you?

226
00:20:29,901 --> 00:20:32,803
- No!
- Huh? Just...

227
00:20:32,805 --> 00:20:34,007
Stop that!

228
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:36,873
Open the fucking door.

229
00:20:39,911 --> 00:20:41,778
Ah, who the fuck is that?

230
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,581
- Just go, okay?
- Who the fuck is that?

231
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,749
- You fucking bitch!
- Just go, Karl!

232
00:20:45,751 --> 00:20:48,151
- Fuck!
- Go!

233
00:20:48,153 --> 00:20:49,722
Fuck, it's like that?

234
00:20:50,922 --> 00:20:53,457
Fuck. All right. What the fuck?

235
00:20:53,459 --> 00:20:54,592
Huh?

236
00:20:54,594 --> 00:20:56,427
Bring that motherfucker
out here.

237
00:20:56,429 --> 00:20:57,964
Let's go!

238
00:21:01,633 --> 00:21:03,868
Leave her alone and get
the fuck out of my building,

239
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,405
you crazy fuck.

240
00:21:08,173 --> 00:21:11,441
All right. Easy, all right.
We're cool, grandma.

241
00:21:11,443 --> 00:21:12,575
Oh, grandma?

242
00:21:12,577 --> 00:21:14,447
You fucking animal. Move!

243
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,083
Easy.

244
00:21:17,115 --> 00:21:17,983
We cool.

245
00:21:31,863 --> 00:21:32,996
Thank you.

246
00:21:32,998 --> 00:21:34,534
You owe me rent.

247
00:21:54,653 --> 00:21:55,988
I know his face.

248
00:22:02,795 --> 00:22:05,098
He's one of twenty-seven
I was looking for.

249
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,068
He was taken a year ago.

250
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:11,872
He's alive.

251
00:22:12,904 --> 00:22:14,173
I can feel it.

252
00:22:17,576 --> 00:22:19,412
I believe that too.

253
00:22:24,784 --> 00:22:25,951
I was close.

254
00:22:56,649 --> 00:22:57,617
I got you.

255
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:26,111
Fuck, yeah.
Deeper, bitch.

256
00:23:28,014 --> 00:23:30,046
You better move on,
whoever the fuck you are.

257
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,852
Keep going.
Get back down there.

258
00:23:35,587 --> 00:23:37,123
I said fuck off!

259
00:23:42,193 --> 00:23:43,694
Fuck!

260
00:23:43,696 --> 00:23:44,828
Who the fuck are you?

261
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,600
Get off the fucking car!

262
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:52,538
What the fuck!

263
00:23:54,673 --> 00:23:55,642
Fuck!

264
00:24:00,979 --> 00:24:03,616
You know that's not just blood
coming out of your ears, right?

265
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:07,720
That's fluid leaking
from your brain.

266
00:24:08,754 --> 00:24:11,322
That's surgery right
there regardless.

267
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:12,689
Fuck, man!

268
00:24:12,691 --> 00:24:15,092
I can't feel my
fucking face anymore.

269
00:24:15,094 --> 00:24:17,695
Imagine what I'll do to you
when I drag you out of this car.

270
00:24:17,697 --> 00:24:19,996
Who the hell are you, man?

271
00:24:19,998 --> 00:24:21,066
Who am I?

272
00:24:24,836 --> 00:24:26,272
It's a good question.

273
00:24:27,172 --> 00:24:29,372
Don't kill me, all right. I'll
tell you all you want to know.

274
00:24:29,374 --> 00:24:32,842
I want to know who they are.
I want their fucking names.

275
00:24:32,844 --> 00:24:35,044
Okay. There's two of them.

276
00:24:35,046 --> 00:24:36,650
I don't know their names.

277
00:24:37,616 --> 00:24:41,051
But these guys,
they're fucking crazy.

278
00:24:41,053 --> 00:24:42,122
What do you mean?

279
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:47,960
I mean, there's some dark
shit going on in this town.

280
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:53,099
There's talks about these guys
that they're different from us.

281
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:55,769
Different how?

282
00:24:57,803 --> 00:24:59,139
That they're not even human.

283
00:25:05,177 --> 00:25:08,946
Oh! Jesus. I'm telling
you straight, man.

284
00:25:08,948 --> 00:25:10,950
These guys are evil,
like cannibals.

285
00:25:12,151 --> 00:25:13,417
I don't believe in monsters!

286
00:25:13,419 --> 00:25:15,084
Jesus fucking Christ.

287
00:25:15,086 --> 00:25:16,887
Where do I find them?

288
00:25:16,889 --> 00:25:18,024
I... I don't know.

289
00:25:19,158 --> 00:25:20,994
- Where do I find them?
- Okay. Okay

290
00:25:22,694 --> 00:25:25,798
I'll tell you everything,
okay. Just stop.

291
00:25:27,132 --> 00:25:30,868
There's a collection tomorrow
night, okay, Eastside storage.

292
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:33,102
Speak to the blind man,

293
00:25:33,104 --> 00:25:34,274
he sees everything.

294
00:25:41,913 --> 00:25:44,984
<i>The great
dragon was thrown down.</i>

295
00:25:47,687 --> 00:25:50,120
<i>That's ancient serpent,</i>

296
00:25:50,122 --> 00:25:54,190
<i>known as the devil or Satan,</i>

297
00:25:54,192 --> 00:25:56,762
<i>great deceiver of the world.</i>

298
00:25:57,796 --> 00:26:00,130
He was thrown down to the earth,

299
00:26:00,132 --> 00:26:03,068
and his angels were
thrown down with him.

300
00:26:09,775 --> 00:26:11,177
Why do I get the feeling

301
00:26:12,077 --> 00:26:14,410
with all the craziness
going on around here,

302
00:26:14,412 --> 00:26:16,115
it's not entirely what you see?

303
00:26:18,883 --> 00:26:21,320
We all have a shadow
side, young man.

304
00:26:22,254 --> 00:26:25,389
I sense yours is
quite a strong one.

305
00:26:25,391 --> 00:26:27,694
If only you could see it.

306
00:26:33,332 --> 00:26:34,367
What do you see?

307
00:26:37,202 --> 00:26:40,806
There's a fine line
between good and evil.

308
00:26:42,274 --> 00:26:47,046
Sometimes you've got to do a
little bad for the greater good

309
00:26:53,219 --> 00:26:55,455
I see destiny.

310
00:27:07,232 --> 00:27:09,001
I don't believe in destiny.

311
00:27:11,437 --> 00:27:13,039
Take care, old man.

312
00:27:15,407 --> 00:27:16,710
But you will.

313
00:27:17,776 --> 00:27:20,043
Oh, you will.

314
00:29:07,952 --> 00:29:09,588
How did
you get this lead?

315
00:29:11,422 --> 00:29:13,058
You really want to know?

316
00:29:15,427 --> 00:29:17,964
See, that's what the
fuck I'm talking about.

317
00:29:19,097 --> 00:29:20,397
You going off the rails,

318
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,498
playing fucking vigilante.

319
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,002
You're going to get us
both in trouble, man.

320
00:29:25,004 --> 00:29:26,906
Don't think I don't
know what you're doing.

321
00:29:34,613 --> 00:29:36,248
Did he deserve it at least?

322
00:29:37,315 --> 00:29:39,549
Let's say I left my mark.

323
00:29:39,551 --> 00:29:40,587
Oh, good.

324
00:29:45,223 --> 00:29:47,092
What are we doing here?

325
00:29:47,992 --> 00:29:49,361
What are we looking for?

326
00:29:53,164 --> 00:29:55,100
Hey, Frank, let me
ask you something.

327
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:02,141
You ever heard of the
occult out here in LA?

328
00:30:04,008 --> 00:30:05,644
You mean like devil worship?

329
00:30:06,946 --> 00:30:07,947
No.

330
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:12,285
Something different.

331
00:30:13,485 --> 00:30:16,055
No. Can't say that I have.

332
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,025
You okay?

333
00:30:29,034 --> 00:30:30,003
That's it.

334
00:30:31,036 --> 00:30:32,238
There it is.

335
00:30:36,475 --> 00:30:38,274
What the fuck.

336
00:30:38,276 --> 00:30:39,312
Let's go.

337
00:30:44,516 --> 00:30:46,149
Hey! Police!

338
00:30:46,151 --> 00:30:47,684
Get out the fucking car!

339
00:30:47,686 --> 00:30:50,123
Freeze! Put the
fucking body down.

340
00:30:51,422 --> 00:30:54,026
I said put that fucking
body down real slow.

341
00:30:56,295 --> 00:30:57,596
Get out the fucking car!

342
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,268
I said get out the fucking car.
Hands where I can see them.

343
00:31:22,621 --> 00:31:26,392
Oh my, that's a big gun.

344
00:31:27,426 --> 00:31:28,494
Quiet, bitch.

345
00:31:29,628 --> 00:31:32,298
Ooh, are you a cop?

346
00:31:36,367 --> 00:31:38,101
Don't you come any closer.

347
00:31:38,103 --> 00:31:40,704
I swear to God I'll put
a fucking bullet in you.

348
00:31:40,706 --> 00:31:42,738
I know what you are.

349
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,709
Well, tell me,

350
00:31:45,777 --> 00:31:47,212
what am I?

351
00:31:48,514 --> 00:31:50,112
You're fucking cannibals.

352
00:31:53,751 --> 00:31:56,285
Don't fucking move.
Put the fucking body down.

353
00:31:56,287 --> 00:31:57,353
- Frank!
- Corbin!

354
00:31:57,355 --> 00:31:59,422
I'm going to shoot this asshole.

355
00:31:59,424 --> 00:32:00,292
It's a nice ring.

356
00:32:03,295 --> 00:32:06,164
I like this one. He's feisty.

357
00:32:08,132 --> 00:32:11,400
Turn around real fucking slow.

358
00:32:11,402 --> 00:32:14,737
This is my favorite part.

359
00:32:14,739 --> 00:32:16,672
Hey!

360
00:32:16,674 --> 00:32:17,642
Boo!

361
00:33:48,366 --> 00:33:50,266
<i>No! No, please!</i>

362
00:33:50,268 --> 00:33:52,171
Jesus fucking Christ.

363
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:20,759
Fuck.

364
00:35:23,495 --> 00:35:24,594
Fuck!

365
00:35:24,596 --> 00:35:27,029
Hey! Hey!

366
00:35:27,031 --> 00:35:29,632
Let me the fuck out of here!

367
00:35:32,303 --> 00:35:34,638
I said let me the
fuck out of here!

368
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,875
<i>Shut the fuck up!
He will come back.</i>

369
00:35:38,477 --> 00:35:39,676
Shout all you want.

370
00:35:39,678 --> 00:35:40,980
Fuck!

371
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,683
Not going to change anything.

372
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:46,252
<i>Fucking bastard.</i>

373
00:35:46,951 --> 00:35:48,520
Just go easy, kid.

374
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:52,458
You could be here for a while.

375
00:35:59,665 --> 00:36:02,368
What is this place?
Where are we?

376
00:36:04,803 --> 00:36:05,805
Nowhere.

377
00:36:08,372 --> 00:36:09,908
Somebody must know a way.

378
00:36:13,078 --> 00:36:14,814
You remember how you got here?

379
00:36:16,948 --> 00:36:18,517
How long you've been here?

380
00:36:20,785 --> 00:36:21,853
Doesn't matter.

381
00:36:24,323 --> 00:36:25,958
<i>To the outside world,</i>

382
00:36:26,892 --> 00:36:28,460
<i>we've all disappeared.</i>

383
00:36:30,529 --> 00:36:31,897
Jesus Christ.

384
00:36:34,665 --> 00:36:35,968
Ghosts, kid.

385
00:36:41,906 --> 00:36:43,542
What's going on?

386
00:36:45,109 --> 00:36:46,511
They are coming.

387
00:37:16,006 --> 00:37:17,442
Jesus.

388
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,967
Corbin, what the hell?

389
00:38:43,761 --> 00:38:45,527
You sick fucks.

390
00:38:47,098 --> 00:38:49,502
Come on, Corbin,
talk to me, man.

391
00:39:27,872 --> 00:39:29,007
Come on, motherfucker!

392
00:39:49,995 --> 00:39:51,096
Son of a bitch.

393
00:39:58,169 --> 00:39:59,902
Fuck you!

394
00:39:59,904 --> 00:40:01,971
<i>Shut the fuck up, man.</i>

395
00:40:01,973 --> 00:40:04,243
You better save
your strength for it.

396
00:40:06,944 --> 00:40:07,979
Eat.

397
00:40:09,114 --> 00:40:11,080
I don't want your food.

398
00:40:11,082 --> 00:40:13,919
If you're going to sit there and
die like a dog, you go ahead.

399
00:40:15,986 --> 00:40:17,689
Oh, hey your friend.

400
00:40:19,189 --> 00:40:20,859
But that was your first fight.

401
00:40:22,093 --> 00:40:23,728
And it's not going
to be your last.

402
00:40:24,663 --> 00:40:25,865
Eat.

403
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:33,835
What if you don't fight?

404
00:40:33,837 --> 00:40:34,873
You're dead.

405
00:40:36,341 --> 00:40:37,810
What if you lose?

406
00:40:39,343 --> 00:40:40,645
If you lose,

407
00:40:41,913 --> 00:40:45,714
let's just say you don't have
to worry about the cage anymore.

408
00:40:45,716 --> 00:40:47,018
<i>Help!</i>

409
00:40:51,823 --> 00:40:53,625
I know what you're thinking.

410
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,796
You're asking
yourself why go on.

411
00:41:03,033 --> 00:41:04,903
They killed
my little boy.

412
00:41:10,841 --> 00:41:13,311
But they spared my wife,

413
00:41:14,913 --> 00:41:16,748
and she's here somewhere.

414
00:41:17,982 --> 00:41:19,584
You think she's still alive?

415
00:41:20,752 --> 00:41:21,921
If she is...

416
00:41:23,288 --> 00:41:25,120
she'll pray for death.

417
00:41:25,122 --> 00:41:26,825
Shut your mouth.

418
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,629
We're just playthings to them.

419
00:41:32,297 --> 00:41:35,665
To who? What are
you talking about?

420
00:41:35,667 --> 00:41:37,002
She's lying.

421
00:41:38,136 --> 00:41:39,201
I know her.

422
00:41:41,272 --> 00:41:44,107
I can still hear their screams.

423
00:41:44,109 --> 00:41:46,141
You've seen nothing.

424
00:41:46,143 --> 00:41:47,710
You're just scared.

425
00:41:47,712 --> 00:41:49,245
I don't understand.

426
00:41:49,247 --> 00:41:50,616
What's it to you, man?

427
00:41:52,283 --> 00:41:53,719
I'm a cop.

428
00:41:55,754 --> 00:41:57,323
I've been trying
to find these people.

429
00:41:58,256 --> 00:41:59,892
Have they found anybody?

430
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,127
No.

431
00:42:04,129 --> 00:42:05,598
Good job, asshole.

432
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:08,633
Useless fucking pig!

433
00:42:13,805 --> 00:42:15,737
What did you see?

434
00:42:15,739 --> 00:42:16,908
Where are the others?

435
00:42:18,209 --> 00:42:19,944
They're just using us.

436
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:22,781
Using us for what?

437
00:42:27,218 --> 00:42:28,187
Food.

438
00:43:05,857 --> 00:43:06,725
No.

439
00:43:08,058 --> 00:43:09,361
I'm already dead.

440
00:43:13,031 --> 00:43:15,797
No!

441
00:43:15,799 --> 00:43:16,966
No!

442
00:43:19,738 --> 00:43:21,804
<i>The missing people

446
00:43:33,317 --> 00:43:34,852
You killed her.

447
00:43:38,022 --> 00:43:40,025
I'm going to fucking kill you.

448
00:43:58,009 --> 00:43:59,808
You're early don't
you think, Frank?

449
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:02,411
I'm not here for
a fucking dance

450
00:44:02,413 --> 00:44:03,782
Corbin is gone.

451
00:44:09,788 --> 00:44:10,856
Ring any bells?

452
00:44:13,357 --> 00:44:16,227
Now I know why Corbin kept
coming to this shithole.

453
00:44:17,395 --> 00:44:21,096
Three girls, six months,

454
00:44:21,098 --> 00:44:23,067
all dancers right here.

455
00:44:25,435 --> 00:44:26,701
Start fucking talking.

456
00:44:26,703 --> 00:44:29,471
Look, I can't help you, Frank,
okay. There is nothing I can do.

457
00:44:29,473 --> 00:44:31,339
No, I don't got
time for bullshit.

458
00:44:31,341 --> 00:44:33,475
I'll drag you down to
the station right now.

459
00:44:33,477 --> 00:44:35,076
Frank, you need to
listen to me, okay?

460
00:44:35,078 --> 00:44:36,045
Two guys.

461
00:44:36,047 --> 00:44:38,580
One's a mean-looking
bastard all in black.

462
00:44:38,582 --> 00:44:39,815
The other one is...

463
00:44:39,817 --> 00:44:42,821
You know, I don't know what
the fuck it was but it did this.

464
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:47,025
Corbin mentioned
something about the occult.

465
00:44:48,526 --> 00:44:51,527
I've seen the bodies, Darius.

466
00:44:51,529 --> 00:44:53,866
I know you know who
I'm talking about.

467
00:44:55,866 --> 00:44:57,401
Just tell me where to find them.

468
00:44:59,603 --> 00:45:01,038
You don't find them.

469
00:45:02,973 --> 00:45:04,176
They find you.

470
00:45:20,091 --> 00:45:21,527
Happy anniversary.

471
00:45:28,098 --> 00:45:29,066
Tell me,

472
00:45:30,301 --> 00:45:31,870
how old am I again?

473
00:45:33,303 --> 00:45:34,539
Thirty-two.

474
00:45:37,174 --> 00:45:40,042
How old am I really?

475
00:45:40,044 --> 00:45:42,044
You'd be seventy-three, darling.

476
00:45:42,046 --> 00:45:43,181
Ah!

477
00:45:44,114 --> 00:45:46,017
Like magic.

478
00:45:49,486 --> 00:45:51,022
Tell me Vince,

479
00:45:53,457 --> 00:45:56,093
all those women
that you killed before,

480
00:45:58,428 --> 00:46:01,098
did you really just murder them?

481
00:46:02,065 --> 00:46:03,632
Yes.

482
00:46:03,634 --> 00:46:05,370
That's all they deserved.

483
00:46:07,004 --> 00:46:09,207
And you didn't fuck any of them?

484
00:46:11,075 --> 00:46:12,343
None of them.

485
00:46:15,946 --> 00:46:17,548
Uh-huh.

486
00:46:19,317 --> 00:46:21,553
I need to know that I'm special.

487
00:46:23,553 --> 00:46:24,889
You are.

488
00:46:27,491 --> 00:46:29,926
That's nice, dear.

489
00:46:46,977 --> 00:46:50,381
Your first kill, it changed you.

490
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:53,051
It made me.

491
00:46:56,053 --> 00:46:58,022
My mother was a whore.

492
00:47:00,959 --> 00:47:03,227
What made me so special?

493
00:47:06,564 --> 00:47:09,431
Because I just knew when
I looked into your eyes,

494
00:47:09,433 --> 00:47:11,102
I was saved.

495
00:47:13,337 --> 00:47:15,073
<i>You're my angel.</i>

496
00:47:22,113 --> 00:47:23,547
They abandoned me.

497
00:47:25,582 --> 00:47:27,318
They didn't deserve you.

498
00:47:28,752 --> 00:47:32,355
My own parents, Vince.

499
00:47:32,357 --> 00:47:33,525
I know, baby.

500
00:47:35,692 --> 00:47:37,261
They killed me.

501
00:47:41,098 --> 00:47:42,366
<i>But you...</i>

502
00:47:43,701 --> 00:47:45,337
<i>...you saved me.</i>

503
00:47:48,306 --> 00:47:50,609
<i>And it changed me forever.</i>

504
00:47:57,114 --> 00:47:58,283
<i>Forever.</i>

505
00:48:03,286 --> 00:48:05,154
Mm...

506
00:48:08,225 --> 00:48:09,527
Fuck.

507
00:48:16,433 --> 00:48:18,236
You look like my mother.

508
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:44,596
Ah!

509
00:49:08,152 --> 00:49:09,654
Argh!

510
00:49:11,321 --> 00:49:12,757
Oh!

511
00:49:41,852 --> 00:49:44,188
I told you I was going
to fucking kill you.

512
00:49:47,825 --> 00:49:49,060
Argh!

513
00:49:54,765 --> 00:49:56,401
He roughed you up pretty good.

514
00:49:59,402 --> 00:50:00,571
He had it coming.

515
00:50:02,506 --> 00:50:03,575
He did.

516
00:50:11,381 --> 00:50:13,150
This place doesn't
make any sense.

517
00:50:16,254 --> 00:50:17,288
What do you mean?

518
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:21,660
Doesn't feel criminal.

519
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:25,229
Feels like something else.

520
00:50:27,931 --> 00:50:29,267
Like what?

521
00:50:31,768 --> 00:50:34,502
Something impossible.

522
00:50:34,504 --> 00:50:35,673
Who took you?

523
00:50:37,507 --> 00:50:38,743
Were there two of them?

524
00:50:41,411 --> 00:50:42,747
That's what I thought.

525
00:50:45,248 --> 00:50:46,852
The one that killed my boy,

526
00:50:47,817 --> 00:50:49,417
he looked like a woman

527
00:50:49,419 --> 00:50:51,687
but there's no way
in hell it was.

528
00:50:51,689 --> 00:50:53,788
He's stronger than a damn mule.

529
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:55,257
You fought them?

530
00:50:55,259 --> 00:50:56,728
Fucking tried.

531
00:50:59,663 --> 00:51:02,198
But I couldn't get near them.

532
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,902
And when I did,
it didn't matter.

533
00:51:06,671 --> 00:51:08,672
The other guy,
he made me watch

534
00:51:13,477 --> 00:51:15,247
<i>as they killed our boy.</i>

535
00:51:17,747 --> 00:51:18,749
You're right,

536
00:51:21,819 --> 00:51:23,555
it isn't criminal.

537
00:51:27,692 --> 00:51:29,394
It's pure evil.

538
00:51:36,767 --> 00:51:40,404
I was told my parents
were taken, murdered.

539
00:51:44,375 --> 00:51:45,810
I didn't believe it at first.

540
00:51:50,647 --> 00:51:52,450
I was given a name.

541
00:51:54,384 --> 00:51:55,252
Who?

542
00:51:56,754 --> 00:51:58,020
Drake.

543
00:52:15,339 --> 00:52:17,906
Ah! Fuck!

544
00:52:19,743 --> 00:52:20,844
<i>You're not afraid.</i>

545
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:24,482
The dark room doesn't scare me.

546
00:52:25,549 --> 00:52:27,585
<i>Does it pleasure
you then, maybe?</i>

547
00:52:29,453 --> 00:52:30,386
What?

548
00:52:30,388 --> 00:52:34,455
<i>The darkness,
its flames engulf you.</i>

549
00:52:34,457 --> 00:52:37,428
<i>Yet, you failed to see this.</i>

550
00:52:41,631 --> 00:52:43,598
Who are you?

551
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,537
<i>The one that dwells
amongst the darkest of souls.</i>

552
00:52:51,709 --> 00:52:53,442
Fuck you!

553
00:52:53,444 --> 00:52:55,380
If you are so bad,
then why are you hiding?

554
00:52:56,846 --> 00:53:00,882
<i>My sin is different to yours.</i>

555
00:53:00,884 --> 00:53:03,886
<i>Its origin is not of your world.</i>

556
00:53:03,888 --> 00:53:06,754
<i>If you fall far enough,</i>

557
00:53:06,756 --> 00:53:08,559
<i>you will see me.</i>

558
00:53:35,453 --> 00:53:38,023
<i>Okay. Open this one next.</i>

559
00:53:58,109 --> 00:54:00,011
<i>Merry Christmas, Zach.</i>

560
00:54:30,975 --> 00:54:32,944
<i>Born into darkness,</i>

561
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:39,718
<i>these men turned to
walk down dark paths.</i>

562
00:54:42,953 --> 00:54:45,090
<i>They take pleasure
in doing wrong.</i>

563
00:54:48,459 --> 00:54:51,763
<i>And they enjoy the
twisted ways of evil.</i>

564
00:55:14,919 --> 00:55:18,857
Ooh. What's shaking, pops?

565
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:23,859
Why don't you just
leave me alone?

566
00:55:23,861 --> 00:55:28,065
Because I just don't understand
why you must live this lie.

567
00:55:29,098 --> 00:55:31,567
I like the sun on my face.

568
00:55:31,569 --> 00:55:32,935
That's enough for me.

569
00:55:32,937 --> 00:55:35,607
Well, I don't miss
seeing the sun.

570
00:55:36,573 --> 00:55:38,142
They're all a joke.

571
00:55:39,076 --> 00:55:41,810
I embrace the darkness.

572
00:55:41,812 --> 00:55:43,712
So fuck them and the day.

573
00:55:43,714 --> 00:55:45,549
We own this world.

574
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:49,183
The Lord preserves
all that love Him

575
00:55:49,185 --> 00:55:52,587
and all the wicked
he will destroy.

576
00:55:52,589 --> 00:55:56,928
Thy throat is an open coffin.

577
00:55:58,928 --> 00:56:00,728
The tongue

578
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:03,667
is used as a weapon to deceive.

579
00:56:04,701 --> 00:56:06,571
Blood of asps

580
00:56:07,638 --> 00:56:09,140
falls through your lips.

581
00:56:11,908 --> 00:56:14,011
I have accepted my fate.

582
00:56:15,212 --> 00:56:17,047
You abandoned the nights!

583
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:21,949
Maybe you're right.

584
00:56:21,951 --> 00:56:24,520
But I'm not the one
who's blind here.

585
00:56:24,522 --> 00:56:26,087
You just don't see it, do you?

586
00:56:26,089 --> 00:56:28,459
See what, old man?

587
00:56:29,792 --> 00:56:31,528
Your time will come.

588
00:56:34,064 --> 00:56:36,968
He will destroy them
and their evil ways.

589
00:56:37,868 --> 00:56:38,866
He?

590
00:56:40,671 --> 00:56:44,007
He abandoned me a long time ago.

591
00:56:46,609 --> 00:56:47,845
But you know what?

592
00:56:48,946 --> 00:56:51,946
You fell from his grace.

593
00:56:51,948 --> 00:56:53,047
And now,

594
00:56:53,049 --> 00:56:56,687
you've got to rot down
here with the rest of them.

595
00:57:09,832 --> 00:57:10,968
Uh!

596
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:48,872
Move.

597
00:57:56,312 --> 00:57:58,245
I said move.

598
00:57:58,247 --> 00:57:59,983
Bro, fuck off.

599
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:28,645
Ah.

600
00:58:35,785 --> 00:58:36,820
Oh.

601
00:58:45,228 --> 00:58:46,330
Come here.

602
00:59:04,314 --> 00:59:06,384
I know she's
fucking that guy.

603
00:59:09,252 --> 00:59:11,319
She thinks I was
a fucking idiot.

604
00:59:11,321 --> 00:59:13,721
Think I'm fucking stupid.

605
00:59:13,723 --> 00:59:15,123
Fuck.

606
00:59:15,125 --> 00:59:17,192
Oh, gosh, you're beautiful.

607
00:59:20,163 --> 00:59:21,765
Fucking Nash.

608
00:59:22,466 --> 00:59:23,332
Fucking Nash.

609
00:59:23,334 --> 00:59:25,736
What the fuck kind
of name is that? Ah!

610
00:59:26,904 --> 00:59:29,270
What the fuck did you just say?

611
00:59:33,877 --> 00:59:36,844
He's still alive.

612
00:59:36,846 --> 00:59:38,348
You should have burned him.

613
00:59:39,348 --> 00:59:42,419
Fuck, Drake.
And fuck the monarchy.

614
00:59:43,821 --> 00:59:45,957
I'll deal with this myself.

615
01:00:28,364 --> 01:00:30,301
Please, God,

616
01:00:32,902 --> 01:00:35,837
send him an angel of light,

617
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:37,475
<i>protect him
from darkness.</i>

618
01:01:00,297 --> 01:01:03,464
Let me go. Let me go.

619
01:01:03,466 --> 01:01:05,169
Let me go.

620
01:01:06,069 --> 01:01:07,305
Let me go.

621
01:01:49,312 --> 01:01:52,249
<i>We're dying.</i>

622
01:02:31,654 --> 01:02:32,589
No.

623
01:02:34,223 --> 01:02:35,325
No.

624
01:02:39,596 --> 01:02:41,265
I ain't fucking doing this.

625
01:02:45,067 --> 01:02:46,437
You got no choice, kid.

626
01:02:49,105 --> 01:02:50,308
Neither do I.

627
01:02:53,542 --> 01:02:55,046
Let's get this over with.

628
01:03:25,308 --> 01:03:26,243
Fight.

629
01:03:33,549 --> 01:03:36,353
Stop it. Stop it.

630
01:03:37,421 --> 01:03:39,022
Argh!

631
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:58,608
Fight.

632
01:04:00,643 --> 01:04:02,046
I'm going to kill you.

633
01:04:03,547 --> 01:04:05,082
Ah!

634
01:04:13,457 --> 01:04:14,525
I'm going to kill you, kid.

635
01:04:16,058 --> 01:04:17,227
I'm going to kill you.

636
01:04:49,158 --> 01:04:50,493
Just fucking do it.

637
01:04:56,132 --> 01:04:57,535
I will see my boy.

638
01:05:02,806 --> 01:05:04,608
I'm sorry.

639
01:05:07,810 --> 01:05:09,212
I can't do it.

640
01:05:14,216 --> 01:05:15,352
No more!

641
01:05:17,319 --> 01:05:19,054
Uh!

642
01:05:19,056 --> 01:05:20,288
Argh!

643
01:05:20,290 --> 01:05:21,656
No! Let him go!

644
01:05:31,768 --> 01:05:34,438
Drake!

645
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:39,510
Drake!

646
01:05:59,261 --> 01:06:00,765
<i>You look like him,</i>

647
01:06:04,301 --> 01:06:06,036
<i>his shadow perhaps.</i>

648
01:06:08,404 --> 01:06:10,105
You killed my parents.

649
01:06:12,241 --> 01:06:14,141
<i>I ate them.</i>

650
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:15,645
<i>But do not be troubled,</i>

651
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:18,812
<i>as I too lost
somebody dear to me</i>

652
01:06:18,814 --> 01:06:22,417
<i>at the hand of your
murderous parents.</i>

653
01:06:22,419 --> 01:06:23,319
Murderous?

654
01:06:24,488 --> 01:06:27,158
What do you call all
this, you sick fuck?

655
01:06:29,125 --> 01:06:30,393
<i>Evolution.</i>

656
01:06:32,529 --> 01:06:35,196
I'm glad my parents killed
your fucking brother.

657
01:06:35,198 --> 01:06:37,401
<i>Your existence is a joke.</i>

658
01:06:38,401 --> 01:06:40,638
<i>It's as if you were
created to fall.</i>

659
01:06:41,705 --> 01:06:44,138
I'm still standing.

660
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:47,241
<i>Your pathetic soul wanders
aimlessly through an existence</i>

661
01:06:47,243 --> 01:06:50,678
<i>that fails everything
you are not.</i>

662
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:51,781
Which is what?

663
01:06:54,151 --> 01:06:55,118
<i>Us.</i>

664
01:07:01,790 --> 01:07:04,428
<i>Many hunters hide
their offspring.</i>

665
01:07:06,428 --> 01:07:08,929
<i>When I threw your parents apart,</i>

666
01:07:08,931 --> 01:07:11,502
<i>I sensed something,</i>

667
01:07:12,801 --> 01:07:14,669
<i>but not you.</i>

668
01:07:14,671 --> 01:07:17,471
<i>You don't carry their strength.</i>

669
01:07:17,473 --> 01:07:19,440
<i>Unlike them,</i>

670
01:07:19,442 --> 01:07:22,546
<i>you are not worthy
to die by my hands.</i>

671
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:27,582
<i>You'll be left to
rot in the streets.</i>

672
01:07:27,584 --> 01:07:31,821
<i>The Nash legacy ends with you.</i>

673
01:07:32,888 --> 01:07:34,755
Come fucking get it.

674
01:07:37,493 --> 01:07:39,426
You better fucking kill me.

675
01:07:43,767 --> 01:07:45,402
Argh!

676
01:08:29,979 --> 01:08:31,549
Something's happening.

677
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:44,628
Don't!

678
01:08:46,496 --> 01:08:47,861
Don't.

679
01:09:01,944 --> 01:09:04,915
Please father, kill me.

680
01:09:06,616 --> 01:09:07,917
Please kill me.

681
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:38,935
That fuck is in there, man.

682
01:11:44,206 --> 01:11:46,109
He's mine.

683
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:54,115
Not with Macy, right?

684
01:11:54,117 --> 01:11:56,687
Shh. I smell something.

685
01:12:01,457 --> 01:12:03,057
Macy, babe!

686
01:12:03,059 --> 01:12:03,994
Shh!

687
01:12:20,710 --> 01:12:22,112
He's done.

688
01:12:41,965 --> 01:12:46,267
You think you can fuck my girl

689
01:12:46,269 --> 01:12:48,768
and live, cocksucker?

690
01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:49,870
Uhm?

691
01:13:01,818 --> 01:13:03,487
Small world.

692
01:13:11,961 --> 01:13:14,794
Nobody fuck with my girl.

693
01:13:14,796 --> 01:13:17,832
We can't make the
same mistake twice.

694
01:13:17,834 --> 01:13:18,836
We should burn him.

695
01:13:19,935 --> 01:13:21,701
You understand?

696
01:13:21,703 --> 01:13:23,169
Nobody...

697
01:13:23,171 --> 01:13:25,272
Ah!

698
01:13:45,894 --> 01:13:47,230
You said he was dead.

699
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:54,067
How do we find him now?

700
01:13:54,069 --> 01:13:55,839
He'll find us.

701
01:14:16,858 --> 01:14:18,194
Hello.

702
01:14:21,863 --> 01:14:24,231
Honey, come out.

703
01:14:24,233 --> 01:14:27,602
I'm going to treat you
like a real boyfriend.

704
01:14:29,605 --> 01:14:31,108
Ha, ha, ha.

705
01:14:34,676 --> 01:14:36,910
Hello, sweetheart.

706
01:14:40,683 --> 01:14:43,086
Are you going to
come out to play?

707
01:14:45,921 --> 01:14:47,757
<i>I'm waiting for you.</i>

708
01:14:48,791 --> 01:14:50,391
And I don't like to wait!

709
01:14:52,127 --> 01:14:54,027
Tick-tock.

710
01:14:54,029 --> 01:14:55,896
Tick-tock.

711
01:14:55,898 --> 01:14:57,935
His time is running out.

712
01:15:03,872 --> 01:15:05,271
Come on!

713
01:16:09,371 --> 01:16:12,142
Destiny caught up
with you after all.

714
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:25,453
Frank.

715
01:16:25,455 --> 01:16:26,689
Corbin?

716
01:16:27,756 --> 01:16:29,789
What the fuck happened to you?

717
01:16:29,791 --> 01:16:32,258
Everybody thinks you're dead.

718
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:34,195
Where are they?

719
01:16:34,197 --> 01:16:38,835
The question you should
be asking is who are they.

720
01:16:40,303 --> 01:16:43,137
They are the founders
of civilizations,

721
01:16:43,139 --> 01:16:45,375
the architects of
historical movement.

722
01:16:46,408 --> 01:16:48,077
They are monsters.

723
01:16:49,412 --> 01:16:51,048
I'm going after them.

724
01:16:53,483 --> 01:16:56,186
- Let me help you.
- No.

725
01:16:57,252 --> 01:17:00,056
You got family.
Too much to lose.

726
01:17:00,989 --> 01:17:01,858
I don't.

727
01:17:10,332 --> 01:17:12,133
They're everywhere.

728
01:17:12,135 --> 01:17:16,536
They've been everywhere
since the dawn of time.

729
01:17:16,538 --> 01:17:18,241
And the two I'm looking for?

730
01:17:19,908 --> 01:17:21,875
<i>The two you seek,</i>

731
01:17:21,877 --> 01:17:23,979
they not only
embrace their gift,

732
01:17:25,281 --> 01:17:27,017
they revel in it.

733
01:17:30,787 --> 01:17:33,890
<i>They work as
collectors in what they call...</i>

734
01:17:36,024 --> 01:17:38,526
<i>the meat trade.</i>

735
01:17:38,528 --> 01:17:42,495
<i>They use some for sport,
fighting humans like dogs.</i>

736
01:17:45,535 --> 01:17:46,970
<i>Others...</i>

737
01:17:48,504 --> 01:17:50,407
<i>they harvest their blood,</i>

738
01:17:51,974 --> 01:17:54,911
<i>storing them as a food source.</i>

739
01:17:57,446 --> 01:18:00,847
They can walk amongst
us in daylight.

740
01:18:00,849 --> 01:18:03,217
They are weak, fragile,

741
01:18:03,219 --> 01:18:05,055
as blind as I.

742
01:18:06,889 --> 01:18:09,392
<i>Their bond was made in life.</i>

743
01:18:12,929 --> 01:18:15,398
<i>It only superseded in death.</i>

744
01:18:17,834 --> 01:18:21,203
<i>These demons are
old fashioned as hell.</i>

745
01:18:23,572 --> 01:18:25,441
I'm all ready for
the game, Frank.

746
01:18:26,442 --> 01:18:27,310
Game?

747
01:18:28,443 --> 01:18:29,946
What game?

748
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:34,017
The only real game
left worth playing.

749
01:18:35,084 --> 01:18:36,318
How do I kill them?

750
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:40,924
A stake through the
heart should do nicely.

751
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:51,201
<i>Now I know, old man.</i>

752
01:18:52,468 --> 01:18:53,870
Rest easy.

753
01:18:57,372 --> 01:18:59,106
I'm going to kill them all.

754
01:21:18,781 --> 01:21:20,450
Ooh.

755
01:21:29,125 --> 01:21:32,325
I am so impressed.

756
01:21:32,327 --> 01:21:34,397
You actually made it.

757
01:21:35,764 --> 01:21:36,565
Vince, honey,

758
01:21:37,767 --> 01:21:41,638
be a doll and go get
our guest a drink.

759
01:21:46,375 --> 01:21:49,142
You look so hot.

760
01:21:49,144 --> 01:21:51,110
Oh, my goodness.

761
01:21:51,112 --> 01:21:51,981
Where is she?

762
01:21:53,049 --> 01:21:55,082
Mmm.

763
01:21:55,084 --> 01:21:57,484
I said where is she?

764
01:21:57,486 --> 01:22:00,456
Shhh. You'll wake my babies!

765
01:22:18,674 --> 01:22:22,109
Now, why don't you
just have a seat?

766
01:22:22,111 --> 01:22:23,276
Fuck you.

767
01:22:23,278 --> 01:22:24,613
You're fucking insane.

768
01:22:27,082 --> 01:22:30,420
You are so fascinating.

769
01:22:33,555 --> 01:22:35,556
I mean, after all,

770
01:22:35,558 --> 01:22:38,859
you should be dead.

771
01:22:38,861 --> 01:22:40,330
I am dead.

772
01:22:41,863 --> 01:22:45,067
You've only just begun.

773
01:22:46,102 --> 01:22:47,537
You know why I'm here.

774
01:22:50,438 --> 01:22:53,042
Well, I thought it was
because you wanted me.

775
01:22:56,444 --> 01:23:00,681
Do you think I'm beautiful?

776
01:23:00,683 --> 01:23:02,519
I'm here for the girl.

777
01:23:04,319 --> 01:23:05,654
And then I'm going to kill you.

778
01:23:10,826 --> 01:23:11,828
And you.

779
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:20,734
That is no way
to talk to a lady.

780
01:23:20,736 --> 01:23:23,706
Ain't no lady here.
You're a freak.

781
01:23:24,806 --> 01:23:26,276
A freak?

782
01:23:28,210 --> 01:23:30,613
I'd rather be a
freak than a whore.

783
01:23:50,398 --> 01:23:52,734
She was begging for you.

784
01:23:58,306 --> 01:24:00,609
I can smell the
whore in that one.

785
01:24:42,384 --> 01:24:44,420
Ah!

786
01:25:00,603 --> 01:25:03,402
Ah!

787
01:25:08,010 --> 01:25:09,479
Oh, Corbin, watch out!

788
01:25:23,925 --> 01:25:25,394
Ah!

789
01:25:50,885 --> 01:25:53,223
Argh!

790
01:25:53,956 --> 01:25:57,790
Your kind fucked up when
they made me what I am.

791
01:26:00,528 --> 01:26:02,361
You should have made sure.

792
01:26:05,901 --> 01:26:07,433
No!

793
01:26:07,435 --> 01:26:08,403
No.

794
01:26:09,705 --> 01:26:11,474
Don't you fucking leave me.

795
01:26:16,745 --> 01:26:19,015
Tell me I'm beautiful.

796
01:26:22,584 --> 01:26:24,354
You're beautiful, baby girl.

797
01:26:26,087 --> 01:26:27,724
Tell me you love me.

798
01:26:31,693 --> 01:26:33,362
I've always loved you.

799
01:26:36,064 --> 01:26:39,368
Then go kill that
motherfucker for me.

800
01:26:43,738 --> 01:26:44,973
Ah.

801
01:27:37,158 --> 01:27:38,424
Oh...

802
01:28:09,957 --> 01:28:11,126
He's safe.

803
01:28:14,830 --> 01:28:15,997
What does he say?

804
01:28:18,434 --> 01:28:20,103
He says thank you.

805
01:28:24,072 --> 01:28:25,074
Thank you.

806
01:28:59,841 --> 01:29:00,742
Loss.

807
01:29:02,243 --> 01:29:04,880
That's the hardest part
about being human.

808
01:29:07,582 --> 01:29:11,487
Eventually in time,
we learn how to let go.

809
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:14,890
But there's always hope, son.

810
01:29:16,791 --> 01:29:18,059
Always hope.

811
01:29:19,495 --> 01:29:24,032
It's in the darkness we're
able to find ourselves.

812
01:29:26,033 --> 01:29:27,836
I can't save them all.

813
01:29:32,974 --> 01:29:34,876
A lot of people
are going to die.

814
01:29:48,223 --> 01:29:49,826
But I'm going to try.

815
01:29:56,998 --> 01:29:58,765
And so it begins.

816
01:29:58,767 --> 01:30:03,072
So it begins.

817
01:30:13,581 --> 01:30:15,315
<i>Behold,</i>

818
01:30:15,317 --> 01:30:19,785
<i>for an angel fell like
lightning from the heavens,</i>

819
01:30:19,787 --> 01:30:22,157
<i>sent to us from God himself.</i>

820
01:30:24,158 --> 01:30:27,093
<i>For now our Lord will
send his vengeance,</i>

821
01:30:29,230 --> 01:30:31,501
<i>disguise my sin,</i>

822
01:30:34,803 --> 01:30:37,670
<i>to fight fire with fire</i>

823
01:30:40,075 --> 01:30:42,812
<i>for even the demons
