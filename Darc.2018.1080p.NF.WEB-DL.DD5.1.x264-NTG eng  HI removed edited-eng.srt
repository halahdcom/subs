1
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,623
Little darc has been busy.

2
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:26,633
Mr. Tagawa says he's teaching me
a valuable trade.

3
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:31,508
Mr. Tagawa likes to sit on his fat ass.

4
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,886
As long as he doesn't have to work,
he'll tell you anything.

5
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:55,865
Hey, kid.

6
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,536
Reading that comic again?

7
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:05,332
"Darc."

8
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:18,221
You want to be a hero, huh?

9
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,949
- Been working hard?
- I fixed the bench.

10
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,161
You're a good boy, baby.

11
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,372
I got you something.

12
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:55,884
Open it.

13
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,555
Mom...

14
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,683
It's great.

15
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,561
Thank you!

16
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:10,398
I love you so much.

17
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,624
You will... do...

18
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,460
As...

19
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,836
I...

20
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,920
Say!

21
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,727
You little shit!

22
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,700
Mom!

23
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,175
Early release.

24
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:03,552
This was you?

25
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:05,679
Yeah.

26
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,016
The answer is still no.

27
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,060
Yeah, well, it's not the agency asking.

28
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,730
It's me, personally.

29
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:14,939
They got my daughter.

30
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,482
Kogakai.

31
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:21,611
Hear what I said?

32
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,491
- Got a bus to catch.
- They took my daughter.

33
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,243
Hey, do you hear me? Hey!

34
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,079
Fuck.

35
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,471
Been playing kachi-kachi?

36
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,684
What's this card?

37
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:53,227
Juu

38
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,730
the only card adopted from the west

39
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,940
and it is totally worthless

40
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,319
only until late in the game.

41
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:04,363
Then it can change everything.

42
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,827
You should spend more time working
and less time gambling.

43
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:28,595
Hey.

44
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,431
Could you stop a second?

45
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,642
My daughter's a nurse.

46
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,005
She got nothing to do with them.

47
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,604
All that shit, they got her holed up
three weeks now.

48
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,190
Can you imagine the hell
she's been put through?

49
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,014
'Cause I'm not going away, pal.

50
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:43,528
I'll stick in your head
like a fucking aneurysm.

51
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,282
It's kogakai.

52
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,576
What the hell do you think I can do?

53
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,745
Whatever the hell I can't.

54
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,542
You got a whole army of agents.

55
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,292
Ok.

56
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:03,256
So interpol gets involved now.
And they're looking for her.

57
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:06,425
Where the hell do you think
we're gonna find her? Tell me.

58
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,971
Sorry, can't help you.

59
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,641
You know I got you an early release.

60
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,476
I'll put you right the fuck back!

61
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,254
Shit. Darc.

62
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,507
You're... you're...

63
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,592
You're out?

64
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:51,929
Yeah, no shit.
What'd I tell you about being out here?

65
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,653
Guess I need to teach you another lesson.

66
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:15,994
Fuck!

67
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,288
Fuck!

68
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,166
You ain't the fucking cops, man.

69
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,043
Stay out of here, motherfucker.

70
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:24,586
Fuck.

71
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,762
I keep the deposit.
<i>Comprende</i>, big man?

72
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:02,735
You got to be fucking kidding me!

73
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,717
What are you looking at?

74
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,553
Excuse me?

75
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,515
Do you wanna bring your ass out here
and help me? Or...

76
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,934
Jeez, forget it.

77
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,739
Just bring 'em in here, maybe.

78
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,497
Just leave it, it's fine.

79
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,796
Do you want an award or something?

80
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,263
Hey, neighbor.

81
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,145
Thank you.

82
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:40,431
<i>Daddy. Please. Please don't...</i>

83
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,230
<i>You want to keep her clean?</i>

84
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,566
<i>You know what to do.</i>

85
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,543
Just beer, not a marriage proposal.

86
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:13,838
Thanks.

87
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:14,965
Oh, he speaks.

88
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,634
My name is...

89
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,094
Ivana mulligan.

90
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:19,929
My friends call me Ivy.

91
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,807
This is the part where you shake my hand.

92
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,226
Jake Walters.

93
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:27,978
People call me darc.

94
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:29,437
Darc. Ok.

95
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:33,817
Nice to meet you.

96
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,527
When she was five,

97
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,737
she fell off a swing.

98
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:21,949
She went into a coma.

99
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,578
A few days pass, she opens her eyes,

100
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,998
and she looks at me and she says,
"I'm sorry, daddy."

101
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,418
Sorry. You're fit.

102
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,924
You don't need this.
You don't need to do it for my daughter.

103
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,011
You should do it for your mother.

104
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,346
<i>Mom!</i>

105
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,768
Come on, baby.

106
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:51,770
Get them!

107
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,772
Get fucking both of them!

108
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,149
Move! Out of the way!

109
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,848
Mom!
Go!

110
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:31,726
Mom!

111
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,687
Mom!

112
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,982
She'll get the justice.

113
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,777
I want it stopped.

114
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:42,655
I want it stopped!

115
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:48,285
Nobody just walks into the yakuza.

116
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:56,752
Kageyama.

117
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,423
Toshio kageyama.

118
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:03,801
You recall that face?

119
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,226
Mom!

120
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:18,065
He's the one that ordered the kidnap.
He set it up.

121
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,110
It's his son, the oyabun.

122
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:27,950
Go, baby, go, go!

123
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,202
Fucking cunt!

124
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,954
Momma!

125
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,163
That's enough!

126
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,888
No!

127
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:55,936
Small world, huh?

128
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,069
Why'd they take her?

129
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:08,782
'Cause a bomb took my leg.
I went down, I came back.

130
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,576
They want to own me.

131
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,537
That's why they have her.

132
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,831
This ain't about me, man.

133
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,209
I don't give a shit
about what happens to me.

134
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,297
It's about my daughter.

135
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:08,451
Fucker!

136
00:16:08,514 --> 00:16:09,514
Fucker!

137
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:11,928
Let go!

138
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,182
Get the police!

139
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,092
For fuck's sake.

140
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,308
Hi. Wow!

141
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:02,771
Almost didn't recognize you.
You really don't clean up half bad.

142
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,565
No.

143
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,569
I'm pretty handy with a hammer.

144
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,780
Do you think that this particular shelf
hung its fucking self?

145
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:17,661
I just... I could...
I could go for a coffee, maybe.

146
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,579
Bye, Ivy.

147
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,756
There's a biker named Bronson.

148
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,299
Toshio wants him dead.

149
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,885
But they got him holed up
in town somewhere.

150
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,357
There we go.

151
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,778
Shigeru kageyama

152
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,491
toshio's son.

153
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:00,245
Kind of a stain
on the family name.

154
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:05,042
The little shig's going to try
to redeem himself

155
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,835
in his old man's eyes.

156
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,755
Shigeru needs help.

157
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,184
You're up.

158
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,271
You know who the fuck I am?

159
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,563
Get off.

160
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:31,235
Yeah, the little asshole
just tried to rip us off.

161
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,703
I'll pay you what we agreed on.
No, the price just doubled.

162
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:42,787
Fuck you.

163
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,040
Wait, relax, all right.

164
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:46,833
Fuck.

165
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,336
Who the fuck are you? Hold him.

166
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,964
Who the fuck are you, asshole?

167
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,216
You have any idea who you're fucking with?

168
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,552
- Come on.
- Let's get him, guys.

169
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,512
Stupid motherfucker.

170
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,835
Where the fuck is Bronson?

171
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,378
Where the fuck is he?

172
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,941
Ah!

173
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,527
Who the fuck are you?

174
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,031
Hey, yo, wait.

175
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,159
Hey, that was fucking awesome.

176
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,828
Seriously, man, I owe you.
Let me buy you a drink.

177
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,122
Got somewhere to be.
Come on.

178
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,624
Just a drink.

179
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:09,999
A talk.

180
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:14,546
You don't like what I say, you walk away.
Keep the cash.

181
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,180
What were you in for?

182
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,058
Which time?

183
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,310
Seriously, what for?

184
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:30,520
I have a temper.

185
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,189
I don't like idiots.

186
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:33,982
Not a good combination.

187
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,797
You ever kill anyone? Not officially.

188
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:46,119
I'm working on something.
You could be helpful.

189
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,955
You know nothing about me.

190
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,498
You'll be checked out.

191
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:51,750
But I need someone now. Someone good.

192
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,253
And I know you are that, huh?

193
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:56,672
Yeah? All right.

194
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,174
- Give me your number.
- Don't have a phone.

195
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:02,761
Never had a need for one.

196
00:21:11,749 --> 00:21:13,250
I'm taking your phone.

197
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,237
Here's my number.

198
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,114
And delete the rest.

199
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,992
- We haven't discussed payment.
- Don't worry about that.

200
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:01,236
Hi, am I interrupting anything?

201
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:04,281
No I... I exercise when I'm bored.

202
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,117
You must get bored a lot.

203
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,372
I am really busy tonight, so I thought,
sorry, that we could have an early dinner.

204
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:16,710
But, no funny business, we're just
neighbors. You fucking understand me?

205
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,338
- I fucking do.
- Ok.

206
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,137
So, I can tell that...

207
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:31,058
You're on the aloof end
of the social spectrum.

208
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,745
Which is not a problem for me,
I tend to talk enough for two.

209
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:37,064
But, the ex-con thing,
that may be an issue.

210
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:40,358
If you were put in
for abusing women or children then,

211
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,195
I gotta go.
And I'm gonna take my food with me.

212
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:47,783
Seriously, though, I think
that there's no lower form of life

213
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,326
than abusers of the innocent.

214
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,661
No arguments from me.

215
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:55,414
Ok.

216
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,085
Ok, great.

217
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,087
Let's eat.

218
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:04,925
Going to get some plates, and what else?
Silverware, probably.

219
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:06,885
No plates.

220
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,930
I guess a corkscrew
is out of the question.

221
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,432
Is out of the question, ok.

222
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,897
- Hmm.
- Ok, don't worry about it.

223
00:23:19,063 --> 00:23:20,731
I shouldn't have wine, anyways.

224
00:23:20,768 --> 00:23:22,567
If my students caught
that on my breath,

225
00:23:22,592 --> 00:23:24,513
half of them would relapse
right there in class.

226
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,906
We just stick to the pizza.

227
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,083
Hi.

228
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,172
So, what do you do?

229
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,800
Keeps you so busy,
you can't even buy the basics.

230
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:50,512
Sorry.

231
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:57,476
Yeah?

232
00:23:58,812 --> 00:23:59,812
I know where.

233
00:24:01,348 --> 00:24:02,348
Yeah.

234
00:24:05,561 --> 00:24:07,563
What I do, I gotta do it now.

235
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,615
- That's ok. Ok.
- I'm sorry.

236
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:16,788
We'll just share it later.

237
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:19,582
I'd like that.

238
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,750
Ok.

239
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,545
Well, I'll just...

240
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:27,424
Have fun doing whatever it is you do.

241
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,734
Four of them. Exit's on the other side.

242
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,195
These assholes killed three of my men.

243
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:56,536
You carrying?

244
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,147
You know how to use a semi, right?

245
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,500
All right.

246
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,590
I... I take the inside.

247
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,059
Come on, baby, daddy wants a queen.

248
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:21,561
Daddy is a queen.

249
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,105
Just fucking deal, Bronson.

250
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:26,274
I win this hand, I'm next.

251
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:29,319
Hey, girl, don't worry,
he won't even touch the sides.

252
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,763
What the fuck is this?

253
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:58,722
Go.

254
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,108
Bronson, it's a jap!

255
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,079
Come on, you motherfucker!

256
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,565
Die, chink.

257
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,529
Hey, I'm Japanese, asshole.

258
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,531
Same fucking difference.

259
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:17,260
Up there, that's where he is.

260
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,220
My father.

261
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:22,682
Emperor toshio kageyama.

262
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,517
An important man.

263
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,979
So very important.

264
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,255
Open your files.

265
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,930
As you can see from the chart...

266
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,015
Since coming to the U.S...

267
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:13,983
Gentlemen, please excuse the intrusion.

268
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,905
I have something you've been
desperately looking for.

269
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:26,913
Momma!

270
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,762
For this, your interrupt business?

271
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:58,027
I thought it was important.
You've been looking for him for weeks.

272
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,613
Finally, I found him.

273
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:01,948
Me...

274
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,658
And my new friend.

275
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,202
Jake Walters, my father.

276
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:09,414
The honorable toshio kageyama.

277
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,315
You brought a fucking <i>gaijin</i>?
Have you looked into him?

278
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,923
My father thinks you're a spy.

279
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,635
I killed three men in front of a witness.

280
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,724
You know any agency
that will condone that?

281
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:33,980
Wait outside.

282
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,742
Where did you find him?

283
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,702
He saved my ass.

284
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,954
And that's not suspicious to you?

285
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,498
He killed in front of me.

286
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:55,043
Besides, they would never try to get
a white guy inside.

287
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:58,213
Because we don't expect it

288
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:01,007
maybe that's exactly what they would do!

289
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:04,594
This guy is seriously good.
I've never seen anyone like him.

290
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:06,971
Trust me.

291
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,099
Just this once.

292
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,483
Remember this...

293
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:23,255
Don't speak about anything
important with him.

294
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,279
Of course.

295
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:29,077
I only hope he is
as good as you say he is.

296
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,995
I would stake my life on it.

297
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:49,556
Let's go.

298
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:57,689
Get me the dragons.

299
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:07,240
Fuck, yeah.

300
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,201
This is just the beginning.

301
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:13,580
Your brawn and my brain,
we're going to build am empire.

302
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:35,059
If you see anything you like,
she's on the house.

303
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:37,896
Kind of particular.

304
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,607
Hey, not me.

305
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,359
Have a look around,
I'm sure you'll find something.

306
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,712
<i>Gaijin.</i>

307
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:46,631
Is there a problem?

308
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:49,133
Yeah, you.

309
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,505
Shit. You ok, man?

310
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,048
You ok

311
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:55,301
- thanks for the help.
- I couldn't.

312
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,303
It was a test.

313
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,071
As a <i>gaijin</i>,

314
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,073
you'll never be yakuza.

315
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:18,282
I'm just here for the money.

316
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:19,992
Do your job,

317
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:22,453
and you'll be well rewarded.

318
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:24,288
I've already done one job.

319
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,502
Didn't you pay him?

320
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:36,300
Huh?

321
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:52,649
Wait.

322
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:01,367
You caused a great deal of damage
to my club.

323
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:03,744
Kanji will drive you home.

324
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,496
- I'll take a cab.
- No.

325
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,331
You work for us.

326
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,167
We'll get you home.

327
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,018
Find out everything you can.

328
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:31,314
This <i>gaijin</i> is hiding something.

329
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,153
Shigeru-San, sent me.

330
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:51,417
They're waiting to drive me back.
Please, if I don't stay...

331
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,796
I can be very good to you.

332
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,442
Do things that'll take your mind
off your injuries.

333
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,551
Come in. Please.

334
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:10,978
Have a seat.

335
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:17,735
Ah! No corkscrew.

336
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,783
Maybe I can help with that.

337
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:28,662
Wait.

338
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:42,051
Please.

339
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,099
That worked.

340
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:51,545
You wouldn't happened to have brought
any glasses with you.

341
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,021
Who needs a glass.

342
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:02,488
It's pretty bad.

343
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:05,442
Perfect with cold pizza.
Those things will kill you.

344
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:13,164
You're right.

345
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,302
Why are you here?

346
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:28,097
Why are you here, Lisa?

347
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:30,933
I'm not judging.

348
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:34,729
My mother was in the trade.

349
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:37,940
She had no choice.

350
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:44,447
My family borrowed money from toshio-San.

351
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:47,908
The business went bad...

352
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,037
- Until the debt's paid off...
- So if you disappear,

353
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:52,662
so does your family.

354
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,836
- Hmm!
- You need to get some rest.

355
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:02,714
Wait.

356
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:09,347
My mother never had any money of her own.

357
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,017
Buy something nice for yourself.

358
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,421
That's my fuckin' pizza.

359
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:02,315
So what?

360
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:05,486
- Need more information.
- Hey, I wanna know my daughter's alive.

361
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,259
That's the problem with today's cops.

362
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,199
No trust in the public.

363
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:14,869
<i>Daddy?</i>

364
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,122
<i>Daddy?</i>

365
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,499
Baby, listen to me. Listen to me!
<i>Daddy!</i>

366
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,629
Need to know who this is.

367
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,506
I'll text you a copy.

368
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:30,404
You better wrap your head around this.
'Cause if one thing happens to her,

369
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,221
I'm coming for you! You hear me?

370
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,072
So, she hit the spot.

371
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,366
The bitch I sent you?

372
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,035
I saw how you looked at her.

373
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,788
Seems all you white fuckers
like a bit of yellow.

374
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,416
But most of the girls
in the club were white.

375
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,460
Where do they come from?

376
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:04,545
All over the world, buddy.

377
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,590
Why do you think we got into
the shipping business?

378
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,511
You planning on starting out on your own?

379
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:14,262
What do you think?

380
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:21,479
I think you're smart enough to know
what would happen to you if you tried.

381
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,234
There. Pull over.

382
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,695
So, what do these guys owe you?

383
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:32,902
It's not a lot of money.
It's the disrespect.

384
00:41:32,927 --> 00:41:37,183
You know, China people not
paying sets a bad example.

385
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:43,167
Do you what Japanese really like?

386
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,586
Sushi and golf.

387
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:08,275
Wait, wait, please!
We didn't have a choice. We didn't...

388
00:42:11,857 --> 00:42:13,492
Everyone has a choice.

389
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:16,450
They make us, they make us!

390
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,035
Triple eight triad!

391
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:19,745
Triple eight triad!

392
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:21,705
They said they would take it over.

393
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,101
And you believed them.

394
00:42:28,194 --> 00:42:29,328
Fucking Chinese!

395
00:42:29,508 --> 00:42:30,527
The register!

396
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:34,843
- Take it. Whatever we have is yours!
- Damn straight, old woman.

397
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:43,269
This will always be
kogakai territory, granny.

398
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:45,354
Remember that.

399
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:50,818
Apologies for the interruption, folks.

400
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:58,701
Enjoy your meals.

401
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:03,163
Looks like we got to go hunting.

402
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:07,084
Time to visit Lee at the triple eight.

403
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:48,709
Hey! Hey!

404
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,615
Fucking Chinese!

405
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:10,833
Help!

406
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:20,259
Please, I'm unarmed.

407
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,761
No witnesses.

408
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,747
Where is Lee?

409
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,917
Where the fuck is Lee?

410
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,681
Relax ladies.

411
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:09,433
I don't kill women.

412
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:11,852
Unless they deserve it.

413
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:13,937
No!

414
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,440
There you go then.

415
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,191
Let's go.

416
00:46:18,775 --> 00:46:19,985
Grab everything you can.

417
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,671
Shigeru-San, back in a minute.

418
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,172
Shigeru.

419
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:26,718
Where's your new friend?

420
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:28,595
Somewhere around here...

421
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,097
He'll be back soon.

422
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:56,915
I see you again,
I'll drown you in your own fat.

423
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,340
Drown him in his own fat?

424
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:07,634
You ok?

425
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:11,555
Who are you?
What are you really doing here?

426
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,348
I'm looking for someone.

427
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:16,350
A girl.

428
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:19,187
Renee lafique.

429
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:22,648
She was here.

430
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:24,276
I took her food.

431
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:26,028
They moved her a few days ago.

432
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:27,486
To where?

433
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:29,239
I don't know.

434
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:32,367
They've got businesses everywhere.

435
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:35,621
Shipping yards, motels, private homes.

436
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,247
Think, Lisa.

437
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:40,125
Maybe someone mentioned something.

438
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:42,724
I have to find her. I'll try to find out.

439
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:51,345
- If she ends up back here, I can call you.
- Be careful.

440
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:54,722
You too.

441
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,727
They'd pay a lot for this information.

442
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:13,283
If Renee's taken back
to the brothel, she'll call me.

443
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:14,951
What do you mean

444
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:18,335
that's all you fuckin' got? Do you
understand the longer you're there,

445
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:20,212
the more of a chance
they find out who you are.

446
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:22,501
They're asking questions now
for Christ sakes.

447
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:23,919
Give them what they want.

448
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:26,505
Be a smart cop, leave out Japan.

449
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:31,843
Oh, come on, you're supposed to make shit
happen. That's why I got you out. Christ.

450
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:34,429
You gotta do something, goddamn it!

451
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:37,265
Do something?

452
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:39,601
Well, how much longer
do you think we've got?

453
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:41,852
Ok.

454
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:45,273
Wha... what does that mean? Ok.

455
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,486
Time to make shit happen.

456
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:21,977
That's everything.

457
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:25,147
What I could find anyway.

458
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:28,817
You gave me short notice, you know.

459
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,279
You're making excuses?

460
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:34,823
Well, that makes me suspicious.

461
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,750
No excuses. Hey, what
do you want me to say?

462
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,509
You want me to say he's bad fucking news?

463
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:42,371
All right.

464
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:44,958
He's bad fucking news.

465
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:58,448
<i>Couldn't imagine the American
back line hold defense like that.</i>

466
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:10,335
<i>Vasquez! Yes, yes, he's through.
He's through.</i>

467
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:14,381
<i>He drops the ball
before he makes the edge.</i>

468
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,968
<i>He's out of the game, how unfortunate.</i>

469
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:40,800
You motherfucker.

470
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,595
You are so dead.

471
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,107
Stay in here.

472
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:12,790
You!

473
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,834
I fucking knew it.

474
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,421
Get help!

475
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:21,007
Get help!

476
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:24,719
You hear me, girl?

477
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:28,056
Do it and your family debt is clean!

478
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,016
Good offer.

479
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,770
If I were her, I'd take it.

480
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:39,067
Who the fuck are you?

481
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:40,694
Think back.

482
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:45,030
Japan.

483
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:47,074
Chiba.

484
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:48,951
An alley.

485
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:54,207
Whore.

486
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:56,835
Her throat,

487
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:59,087
slit.

488
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:02,173
I was eight years old.

489
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,306
Darc boy?

490
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:13,268
I'm gonna kill you toshio-San.

491
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:15,812
We both know that.

492
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:17,229
Unless,

493
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,524
tell me where Renee lafique is.

494
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:25,613
Where?

495
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,453
Ok. Ok.

496
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:36,916
She's...

497
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:41,463
Your momma had some good moves.

498
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:58,980
You fucking idiot!

499
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:04,277
We'd never hide her
in such a public place.

500
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:40,145
Jake.

501
00:56:47,403 --> 00:56:48,530
You should've left.

502
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:50,281
I almost did.

503
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:53,243
They know I'm here.

504
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:55,620
You can't just leave me.

505
00:56:57,664 --> 00:57:00,264
They'll torture me, I'll tell them
everything and they'll kill me.

506
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:03,669
Lisa. Do it.

507
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,136
Do it.

508
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:15,264
Please.

509
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:50,883
Come with us.

510
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:57,432
That's a big gun.

511
00:57:58,057 --> 00:57:59,057
It's a big world.

512
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:01,352
They're just business associates.

513
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:04,022
Well, they're being loud.
I'd like them to go.

514
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,399
Oyabun is on his way from Japan.

515
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:08,485
Shigeru needs you.

516
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:11,654
Wait outside.

517
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:14,282
This gun is getting real heavy, boys.

518
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:17,118
It might just go off any minute.

519
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:33,676
You're a taciturn bastard.

520
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:37,180
The people you associate yourself with,

521
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,474
they speak volumes.

522
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:54,822
He'll be with us soon.

523
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:03,414
<i>One more time.</i>

524
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:06,251
Where'd you get these tattoos?

525
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:09,587
Do it.

526
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:18,221
Tell me who sent you, <i>gaijin</i>.

527
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:21,391
Did toshio

528
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:23,726
is that why you killed him?

529
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:27,814
Hit him!

530
00:59:28,189 --> 00:59:29,190
Harder!

531
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:33,111
Harder!

532
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:35,196
Do it again!

533
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:39,200
Get out.

534
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,370
He doesn't work for you

535
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:43,746
get out.

536
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:48,363
- Get out of or I'll fucking castrate you!
- Get out or I'll fucking castrate you!

537
00:59:51,629 --> 00:59:53,172
Who brought him here?

538
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:54,923
Me.

539
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:57,719
Who put you in charge?

540
00:59:58,344 --> 00:59:59,512
Look at his tattoos.

541
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:02,056
He is not who he says he is.

542
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:03,808
I knew about them!

543
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:06,311
It's one of the reasons I hired him!

544
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:07,854
What the fuck do you know?

545
01:00:08,229 --> 01:00:10,481
You were born in America.

546
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:12,650
I was toshi's aide.

547
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:16,112
He was my friend.

548
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,656
He was my father!

549
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:25,913
And he regretted that every day.

550
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:34,380
You were my father's pet dog.

551
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:37,884
Just a translator. Nothing more.

552
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:40,613
The only reason I won't kill you...

553
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:43,431
My grandfather will want to know
where you were when my father died!

554
01:00:58,237 --> 01:00:59,322
Taking you home.

555
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:01,615
And, Jake,

556
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:03,159
don't go too far.

557
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,662
You and I have a lot to discuss.

558
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:17,358
What about the whore?

559
01:02:19,944 --> 01:02:22,488
It's strange she was the only one
left alive.

560
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:24,031
She was knocked out.

561
01:02:24,198 --> 01:02:28,286
She called us as soon as she came round.

562
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:31,289
Why would she do that if she was involved?

563
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:32,999
- The <i>gaijin</i> is the...
- Not again.

564
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:35,898
He has done everything we've asked of him.

565
01:02:35,899 --> 01:02:37,712
He has done everything
we have asked of him.

566
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:39,046
For money.

567
01:02:39,797 --> 01:02:44,552
- What if someone offered him more?
- Like fucking who?

568
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:46,053
Enough.

569
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:49,557
If the <i>gaijin</i> is innocent

570
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:52,185
then the attack was carried out
by someone else.

571
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:55,312
Shigeru.

572
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:59,817
Find out who and clear his name.

573
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:01,194
Kanji.

574
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:05,782
When this is over,
I want to hear about how toshio died

575
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:09,744
while you were responsible
for his security.

576
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:11,621
And both of you,

577
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:13,331
remember this well.

578
01:03:15,249 --> 01:03:17,668
We are yakuza.

579
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:23,174
No individual is more important
than the family.

580
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:43,653
I think
you owe me an explanation.

581
01:03:49,742 --> 01:03:51,035
Oh, my god.

582
01:03:52,119 --> 01:03:53,204
What happened to you?

583
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:55,331
I bruise easily.

584
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,169
You're such an asshole. Come on.

585
01:04:04,131 --> 01:04:06,008
Let me talk to the cop.

586
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:11,180
This cop is mine. Get your own source.

587
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:13,432
This cop's mine. Get your own source.

588
01:04:14,058 --> 01:04:16,394
Speak fuckin' english, asshole.

589
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:20,290
No individual is more important

590
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:21,816
than the family.

591
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:41,711
Tell me.

592
01:04:41,794 --> 01:04:44,672
If you trust me, this isn't something
you want to know about.

593
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:48,466
I want to know.

594
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:56,976
They kidnapped someone.

595
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:00,813
I'm trying to find her.

596
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:04,025
'Cause it's a cop's daughter.

597
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:08,279
- He came to me.
- Oh!

598
01:05:10,114 --> 01:05:13,659
- I gotta go. I gotta get out there.
- Ok. Ok.

599
01:05:13,951 --> 01:05:16,388
I don't know if you're going to be
any help to anybody right now.

600
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:18,331
Don't be an idiot. Come on, ok.

601
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:23,544
Come this way.

602
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:31,552
Ivy, I...

603
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:34,013
I just wanted to tell you...

604
01:05:36,807 --> 01:05:37,807
Sorry.

605
01:05:47,985 --> 01:05:48,986
Wuss.

606
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:01,457
- Where's kanji?
- Fuck kanji.

607
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:04,585
- Get out!
- Calm down.

608
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:10,195
- Play fucking stupid with me. I dare you!
- I'm mot playing stupi...

609
01:06:10,219 --> 01:06:11,219
Who did it?

610
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:13,844
I'm not going to ask you again. Who?

611
01:06:16,055 --> 01:06:17,055
Lee.

612
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:20,850
Lee.

613
01:06:24,188 --> 01:06:25,231
From triple eight.

614
01:06:41,872 --> 01:06:42,872
Never.

615
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:45,626
No, no. He can't be.
He doesn't have the balls.

616
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:47,962
And what if he shot up your place, huh?

617
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:49,714
What if he killed your men?

618
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:50,983
What the fuck would you have done?

619
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,467
Your job's to keep people
from fucking back.

620
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:55,553
You fuckhead.

621
01:06:55,761 --> 01:06:57,013
If you're not doing that,

622
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:01,183
why the fuck do we need
your little bitch daughter?

623
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:24,373
You are certain it was him?

624
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:25,875
He admitted it.

625
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:29,003
His final words.

626
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:31,047
How did you find out?

627
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:33,507
I suspected from the beginning.

628
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:36,719
Our interpol dog confirmed it.

629
01:07:36,802 --> 01:07:40,389
The same man who provided
the dossier on your partner?

630
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:43,559
That's right. He's been very useful.

631
01:07:43,976 --> 01:07:47,646
So, your friend is cleared.

632
01:07:48,939 --> 01:07:50,441
As I expected.

633
01:07:53,086 --> 01:07:56,656
Shigeru, you've done well.

634
01:07:58,699 --> 01:08:02,828
You're becoming the man
we always hoped you would.

635
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:50,352
Sorry for the interruption

636
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:52,062
but we have more information.

637
01:09:53,147 --> 01:09:58,402
There were important details
omitted from the policeman's dossier.

638
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:07,786
<i>Only until late in the game.</i>

639
01:10:08,996 --> 01:10:11,290
<i>Then it can change everything.</i>

640
01:10:22,801 --> 01:10:23,802
Hey.

641
01:10:24,428 --> 01:10:25,846
He's alive.

642
01:10:28,182 --> 01:10:29,683
How did I get here?

643
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:31,560
You don't remember.

644
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:34,605
Those pills I gave you
really knocked you out.

645
01:10:35,105 --> 01:10:36,565
Ivy, how long have I been out?

646
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:41,487
- Ah... sixteen hours.
- Damn it, I got to go.

647
01:10:42,279 --> 01:10:43,864
Yeah, 'cause you seem fine.

648
01:10:46,283 --> 01:10:48,118
Ivy, there's a girl's life on the line.

649
01:10:51,163 --> 01:10:54,166
So, you're gonna risk yours to save hers.

650
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:08,889
I'm told, you're the last person
to see my son alive.

651
01:11:09,431 --> 01:11:12,059
You'll tell us exactly what happened.

652
01:11:12,893 --> 01:11:14,979
And before you begin,

653
01:11:15,813 --> 01:11:17,064
you should know,

654
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:20,693
I have a man on the way
to your family's home.

655
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:33,997
Huh!

656
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:37,626
I brought your pain killers.

657
01:11:38,377 --> 01:11:41,297
Supposed to take two.
They're really potent.

658
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:42,797
So...

659
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:51,765
Ok, or six.

660
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:56,895
- Ivy, you know...
- No, I'm sorry. I...

661
01:12:00,774 --> 01:12:01,942
Peace offering.

662
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:04,528
Unless you were planning on hitching.

663
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:13,578
Just come back.

664
01:12:17,541 --> 01:12:18,542
I promise.

665
01:12:36,435 --> 01:12:39,313
Please, please, please.

666
01:12:44,943 --> 01:12:46,945
All this for one woman?

667
01:12:47,237 --> 01:12:50,532
Two, if you count his mother.

668
01:12:51,575 --> 01:12:54,620
Bring me this woman.
And find kanji and shigeru.

669
01:13:18,602 --> 01:13:20,062
Grandfather?

670
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:33,301
Yeah?
<i>Hey, something went wrong.</i>

671
01:13:33,325 --> 01:13:34,636
<i>Something really went fucking wrong.</i>

672
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:37,037
They just told me to pick my daughter
up at the docks.

673
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:38,281
What the fuck does that mean?

674
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:39,248
<i>Lafique...</i>
- they know.

675
01:13:39,292 --> 01:13:41,211
Where?
- Pier 9.

676
01:13:41,275 --> 01:13:43,069
Wait outside. Do not go on your own.

677
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:44,880
<i>Can you hear me lafique?</i>

678
01:13:45,003 --> 01:13:47,005
A cartload of shit.

679
01:14:13,574 --> 01:14:14,574
Where's my daughter?

680
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:17,369
You were warned what would happen to her
if you ever lied to us.

681
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:18,453
So, where's my daughter?

682
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:25,085
Are you fucking insane?

683
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:26,753
Are you fucking insane?

684
01:14:27,171 --> 01:14:28,297
Hey!

685
01:14:41,268 --> 01:14:42,561
Baby! Baby!

686
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:48,025
Come on, listen to me.

687
01:14:48,442 --> 01:14:49,442
Cut her down.

688
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:54,823
- I'll tell you everything.
- We already know everything.

689
01:15:04,416 --> 01:15:05,459
Baby!

690
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:11,335
Cut her down! Cut her down!

691
01:15:14,468 --> 01:15:15,468
Cut her down.

692
01:16:16,321 --> 01:16:17,322
No!

693
01:16:20,325 --> 01:16:21,994
Renee, your dad's with me.

694
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:24,245
Renee.

695
01:16:24,913 --> 01:16:25,913
Renee? Lisa.

696
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:31,002
Lisa.

697
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:32,254
I'm sorry.

698
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:39,928
I got you.

699
01:16:40,554 --> 01:16:42,431
I told them, they know. They know.

700
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:43,973
I know. That's all right.

701
01:16:47,477 --> 01:16:49,521
Get away! Go!

702
01:16:57,613 --> 01:16:59,740
He fucking lied to me!

703
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:03,619
All this time, he's been lying to me,
making a fool of me!

704
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:06,997
Faster, you fucking monkey! Faster!

705
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:08,749
Faster!

706
01:17:27,559 --> 01:17:28,685
Where is he?

707
01:17:31,271 --> 01:17:32,564
Where the fuck is he?

708
01:17:48,872 --> 01:17:50,332
Where the fuck is he?

709
01:17:50,415 --> 01:17:52,459
He's not fucking here!

710
01:18:01,468 --> 01:18:02,678
Get off me!

711
01:18:13,563 --> 01:18:14,731
Tell me!

712
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:17,693
Where the fuck is he?

713
01:18:31,623 --> 01:18:32,623
Enough!

714
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:34,793
Don't!

715
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:37,796
- I fucking vouched for you!
- Drop the knife.

716
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:40,882
Those tattoos, the night we met,

717
01:18:41,216 --> 01:18:43,093
it wasn't just chance, was it?

718
01:18:44,177 --> 01:18:46,304
-Let her go, shigeru.

719
01:18:46,513 --> 01:18:48,140
She's just my neighbor.

720
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:49,890
Shigeru.

721
01:18:51,685 --> 01:18:54,104
Fuck you, and all your fucking lies!

722
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:56,022
Move! Secure him.

723
01:18:58,108 --> 01:18:59,151
It's pointless.

724
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:03,321
It'll just be you and me.

725
01:19:04,656 --> 01:19:08,285
You will never be oyabun.

726
01:19:09,995 --> 01:19:12,372
You fucking...

727
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:14,666
Do it.

728
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:17,627
The last thing you're gonna see
will be the inside of her throat.

729
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:20,922
- No, no, no.
- On your fucking knees, you piece of shit.

730
01:19:22,382 --> 01:19:23,382
Secure him!

731
01:19:24,259 --> 01:19:25,719
Hands behind your back!

732
01:19:26,636 --> 01:19:28,305
Ivy, it's ok.

733
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:33,226
It's ok.

734
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:35,603
Shigeru.

735
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:41,943
She's innocent.

736
01:19:42,235 --> 01:19:43,653
Shigeru-San,

737
01:19:44,488 --> 01:19:45,739
let her go.

738
01:19:48,992 --> 01:19:49,992
Fuck it.

739
01:19:56,082 --> 01:19:57,082
No!

740
01:20:30,408 --> 01:20:31,408
Enough!

741
01:20:35,121 --> 01:20:36,623
Put him in a chair

742
01:20:43,129 --> 01:20:44,130
Leave us.

743
01:20:48,218 --> 01:20:49,803
Shigeru, you too.

744
01:20:51,096 --> 01:20:52,222
Oyabun, please.

745
01:21:08,321 --> 01:21:09,698
Look at me.

746
01:21:22,836 --> 01:21:26,006
There was a boy once, a lifetime ago,

747
01:21:27,424 --> 01:21:30,051
with a whore for a mother.

748
01:21:31,386 --> 01:21:32,846
That he was even allowed to live,

749
01:21:32,929 --> 01:21:34,806
was a mistake.

750
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:39,019
I can't recall most
of the men I've killed,

751
01:21:39,436 --> 01:21:40,562
but women,

752
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:43,857
there's something different about them.

753
01:21:47,777 --> 01:21:50,488
You want to kill me, darc?

754
01:21:54,951 --> 01:21:56,411
It's like you said,

755
01:21:57,787 --> 01:21:59,414
it was a lifetime ago.

756
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:04,252
And yet, my son died in the present.

757
01:22:04,502 --> 01:22:05,962
Get that little shit in here.

758
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:13,261
He's weak, he's ambitious,
perhaps, even he's a coward.

759
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:17,474
But it is his duty to avenge
his father's death.

760
01:22:19,309 --> 01:22:20,602
Oyabun, I...

761
01:22:25,398 --> 01:22:29,444
You will take him away and deal with him.

762
01:22:34,074 --> 01:22:35,367
Leave it to me.

763
01:22:35,742 --> 01:22:38,328
You will take Mr. Kimuro with you.

764
01:22:39,412 --> 01:22:40,497
Wait a second, oya...

765
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:42,332
You'll do what I say!

766
01:22:47,587 --> 01:22:48,797
I understand.

767
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:36,821
Jake.

768
01:24:39,991 --> 01:24:41,034
Come on, Jake.

769
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:47,582
I fucking saved your life, Jake.

770
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:50,460
Fucking saved your life.

771
01:24:51,377 --> 01:24:52,545
I have money.

772
01:24:52,712 --> 01:24:54,339
You and I can start something.

773
01:24:54,839 --> 01:24:57,884
It was just a fucking girl! Come on.

774
01:24:59,511 --> 01:25:01,221
Jake, please.

775
01:25:01,471 --> 01:25:02,680
Come on, Jake.

776
01:25:03,264 --> 01:25:05,475
Jake, come on. Jake, please.

777
01:25:05,892 --> 01:25:07,435
Jake, Jake, Jake!

778
01:25:07,727 --> 01:25:09,312
Please, please don't.

779
01:25:10,063 --> 01:25:11,439
Jake, please!

780
01:25:28,623 --> 01:25:30,250
Prepare the men.

781
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:44,365
Get out! Move it, move!

782
01:26:44,824 --> 01:26:46,075
Move, get out, move!

783
01:29:12,638 --> 01:29:13,723
Juu...

784
01:29:15,099 --> 01:29:18,019
The card that can change everything.

785
01:29:22,690 --> 01:29:26,235
Are you here to save the girl?

786
01:29:26,861 --> 01:29:28,488
Or avenge your mother?

787
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:30,907
You don't even know anymore.

788
01:29:34,243 --> 01:29:35,243
Drop it.

789
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:39,415
You want to save her?

790
01:29:39,999 --> 01:29:42,710
Or let her end up like your whore mother?

791
01:29:56,057 --> 01:29:57,850
You're already dead.

792
01:29:58,518 --> 01:29:59,852
So, end it now,

793
01:30:00,103 --> 01:30:01,604
and I'll let her live.

794
01:30:09,821 --> 01:30:10,821
Her life.

795
01:30:11,531 --> 01:30:12,949
Or yours.

796
01:30:48,484 --> 01:30:49,485
I'm sorry.

797
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:53,739
Do it, or else.

798
01:31:16,429 --> 01:31:17,889
Of course,

799
01:31:18,347 --> 01:31:20,349
where I'm going to send her,

800
01:31:20,975 --> 01:31:23,144
she will be begging for death.

801
01:31:23,811 --> 01:31:24,979
She will wish...

802
01:31:38,409 --> 01:31:39,409
Mister.

803
01:31:48,544 --> 01:31:50,922
Stay with me. Stay with me!

804
01:31:54,759 --> 01:31:55,759
Breathe!

805
01:31:56,052 --> 01:31:59,639
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

806
01:32:00,389 --> 01:32:01,641
Come on, breathe!
