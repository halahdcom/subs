Don't close your eyes.

- Out of the way!

Roger that, doc.
I'll be right there.

Dr. Kersey,
you're needed in Trauma One.

58
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,879
- Chris, switch with me.
- Got it.

59
00:02:27,112 --> 00:02:29,079

62
00:02:32,784 --> 00:02:34,484
- Doc, please.
- Hold on.

63
00:02:34,486 --> 00:02:37,754
Thoracotomy tray now.
Five units of O-neg, stat.

64
00:02:37,756 --> 00:02:39,256
And five more
en route to the ER.

65
00:02:39,258 --> 00:02:40,958
Get the OR ready.

66
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,629
Yes, doctor.

67
00:02:47,432 --> 00:02:48,433
Let's call it.

68
00:02:50,301 --> 00:02:52,771
Time of death, 12:24 a.m.

69
00:02:56,908 --> 00:02:58,841
<i>Got here in six minutes.</i>

70
00:02:58,843 --> 00:03:00,710
I couldn't go any faster.

71
00:03:00,712 --> 00:03:02,346
It had nothing to do with you.

72
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:05,816
His heart stopped.
He's lost too much blood.

73
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,020
We did everything we could.

74
00:03:10,088 --> 00:03:11,254
Sorry for your loss.

75
00:03:11,256 --> 00:03:12,558
Shooter's in Two, doc.

76
00:03:16,094 --> 00:03:17,096
Sorry.

77
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:24,133
<i>Dr. Kersey,
OR Two. Dr. Kersey, OR Two.</i>

78
00:03:24,135 --> 00:03:28,040
What? Now you're gonna go
save the animal that shot him?

79
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:30,376
If I can.

80
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,540
I think
it's running a little slow.

81
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:05,976
Maybe it's time for a new one.

82
00:04:05,978 --> 00:04:08,046
- No, I like this one.
- Mmm.

83
00:04:10,314 --> 00:04:11,617
They said 9:00.

84
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,084
She's going to get in.

85
00:04:15,086 --> 00:04:17,689
I know. I just miss envelopes.

86
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,490
None of this online crap.

87
00:04:20,492 --> 00:04:22,925
Oh, my God! Yes!

88
00:04:24,062 --> 00:04:25,394
That sounds like a good scream.

89
00:04:25,396 --> 00:04:27,733
That sounded like
a very good scream.

90
00:04:32,504 --> 00:04:33,736
Oh, hey, guys, what's up?

91
00:04:33,738 --> 00:04:36,406
Hi, baby.
You want some breakfast?

92
00:04:36,408 --> 00:04:38,541
- Mmm-hmm.
- How are you? How you doing?

93
00:04:38,543 --> 00:04:41,411
- I'm good.
- Yeah? You're hungry?

94
00:04:41,413 --> 00:04:43,380
- Yeah, I'm starving.
- Want some eggs?

95
00:04:43,382 --> 00:04:45,084
Mmm. Yes, please.

96
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:48,752
Are you excited
for your game?

97
00:04:48,754 --> 00:04:51,822
Eh. It's just a game.

98
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:54,123
Hey, I thought
I heard a noise upstairs.

99
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,425
Did you hear anything?

100
00:04:55,427 --> 00:04:57,997
Yeah, I thought I heard
something, what was that?

101
00:04:59,298 --> 00:05:02,765
Thank you.
I got in. I got in! I got in!

102
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:06,469
So happy, honey.

103
00:05:06,471 --> 00:05:07,570
I'm so happy for you!

104
00:05:07,572 --> 00:05:08,772
I'm gonna be living
in New York City!

105
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,211
I will fly home on weekends
to do laundry, okay?

106
00:05:15,213 --> 00:05:16,279
I promise.

107
00:05:16,281 --> 00:05:17,680
Okay, okay, good.

108
00:05:17,682 --> 00:05:20,452
Oh, my God. I have to text
Sophie to see if she got in.

109
00:05:26,858 --> 00:05:29,394
Our girl is going
to college.

110
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:31,461
I'm happy.

111
00:05:31,463 --> 00:05:32,930
- Really.
- Yeah?

112
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:34,964
- Mmm-hmm.
- I think you have to tell that to your face.

113
00:05:34,966 --> 00:05:36,401
- Mmm. Baby.
- Mmm.

114
00:05:38,103 --> 00:05:39,836
Don't stop! Come here!

115
00:05:39,838 --> 00:05:42,040
- Watch the defender.
- Go, go, go!

116
00:05:43,442 --> 00:05:45,675
All right, come on, Jordan.
Let's go, Jordan!

117
00:05:45,677 --> 00:05:47,447
- Jordan!
- Let's go!

118
00:05:49,413 --> 00:05:50,848
I guess I always had it
in my head

119
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,683
that she'd go to
Northwestern. Someplace close.

120
00:05:53,685 --> 00:05:55,652
Yeah.
You think my dad was happy

121
00:05:55,654 --> 00:05:57,887
when I wanted to leave Texas
to go to college?

122
00:05:57,889 --> 00:05:59,456
Well, this is different.

123
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,024
How's it different?

124
00:06:01,026 --> 00:06:03,526
It's just that now we are
the ones that have to let go.

125
00:06:03,528 --> 00:06:06,596
That's a foul! Hey!
That was cleats up!

126
00:06:06,598 --> 00:06:09,365
- What the fuck, ref?
- Oh.

127
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:10,567
Really?

128
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:12,969
I guess I didn't think
it would happen so fast.

129
00:06:12,971 --> 00:06:16,005
That's a bullshit pass,
Brianna. You know that!

130
00:06:16,007 --> 00:06:17,608
I think we're gonna see her
more than we think.

131
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,709
Because we've got, um,
Thanksgiving,

132
00:06:19,711 --> 00:06:21,144
- we've got Christmas...
- Mmm.

133
00:06:21,146 --> 00:06:22,678
And we get to go
to New York City.

134
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,514
Foul! That's another foul!

135
00:06:25,516 --> 00:06:27,218
- Jesus Christ!
- Take it easy, pal.

136
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,053
You're gonna give yourself
a heart attack.

137
00:06:30,055 --> 00:06:32,723
I wasn't talking to you,
Lake Shore Drive.

138
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:36,493
No, as a matter of fact,
you were talking to everyone.

139
00:06:36,495 --> 00:06:38,995
Just dial down the language,
there's kids here.

140
00:06:38,997 --> 00:06:39,999
Or what?

141
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,534
Uh, Paul, come on.

142
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:46,070
I would just shut the fuck up
if I were you.

143
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,707
That's a good idea.
Why don't you do that?

144
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:55,047
Be me, and just shut the...
Fuck up.

145
00:06:56,548 --> 00:06:57,582
You think that's funny?

146
00:07:00,084 --> 00:07:01,250
Say it again.

147
00:07:01,252 --> 00:07:03,053
Come on, funny guy.

148
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:04,290
Say it again.

149
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:08,257
Now you're quiet, huh?

150
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:10,959
- Come on! Come on!
- Stop it!

151
00:07:10,961 --> 00:07:13,130
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Come here.

152
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:16,067
Oh, that's right.
Get your wife to defend you.

153
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:17,870
Pussy.

154
00:07:20,505 --> 00:07:22,441
It's all right. All right.

155
00:07:25,076 --> 00:07:28,077
Okay, so then the guy gets
right in Dad's face, okay?

156
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,146
And he starts shoving him

157
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:30,413
and it literally stops
the game.

158
00:07:30,415 --> 00:07:31,514
Spitting right in my face.

159
00:07:31,516 --> 00:07:32,949
I had to get in
the middle of it.

160
00:07:32,951 --> 00:07:34,851
I was gonna punch
the guy. Right?

161
00:07:34,853 --> 00:07:37,320
Why didn't you
whoop this guy's butt?

162
00:07:37,322 --> 00:07:38,589
Like in the old days.

163
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,457
Thank God your mom came over.

164
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:42,593
Wait, Dad, the "old days"?

165
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:43,760
Yeah, your dad was a scrapper.

166
00:07:43,762 --> 00:07:44,894
Yeah, I was a scrapper.

167
00:07:44,896 --> 00:07:46,596
Really?
You never told me that!

168
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:48,798
He would've, back in the day.

169
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,466
Tell her. Tell her.

170
00:07:50,468 --> 00:07:52,569
- I used to fight my dad.
- Oh.

171
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:53,836
Fighting all the time.

172
00:07:53,838 --> 00:07:55,904
You know, he was screaming
and crying in the house.

173
00:07:55,906 --> 00:07:57,341
And guess who was crying?

174
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,007
Me. I lost every fight.

175
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:01,144
- Terrible.
- I still love you, Dad.

176
00:08:01,146 --> 00:08:03,779
You should take Krav Maga.
You study that.

177
00:08:03,781 --> 00:08:05,882
This way, when you go
to college, and these guys,

178
00:08:05,884 --> 00:08:07,651
when they get a little too
aggressive with you,

179
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,252
you know what to do.

180
00:08:09,254 --> 00:08:10,753
Don't look at me like I don't
know what I'm talking about.

181
00:08:10,755 --> 00:08:12,288
No, no. Yeah, I'm just saying,
like, maybe I already know it.

182
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,555
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

183
00:08:13,557 --> 00:08:14,490
- Jordan!
- All right, all right.

184
00:08:14,492 --> 00:08:15,625
I tapped out.

185
00:08:15,627 --> 00:08:17,493
Seriously, she trains Monday,

186
00:08:17,495 --> 00:08:19,596
Wednesday, and Friday,
this one. Watch out.

187
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:20,831
- Really?
- I'm training.

188
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,164
And I actually found
a boxing gym in Tribeca

189
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,365
that all the supermodels go to.

190
00:08:23,367 --> 00:08:24,800
So I'm gonna start going there.

191
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:28,805
And speaking of college,
how about your PhD?

192
00:08:28,807 --> 00:08:30,606
Oh, that's very nice of you
to remember.

193
00:08:30,608 --> 00:08:31,942
How about that?

194
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:34,377
Yes, 15 years in the making,
I am soon to be a doctor.

195
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:36,946
- Cheers to Mom, right?
- How about that? Come on.

196
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:38,147
Two Dr. Kerseys.
Can you believe it?

197
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:39,349
Two doctors.

198
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:41,017
- Are you gonna call me Doctor?
- Yes, I am.

199
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:42,652
- You are?
- I'm gonna call you Dr. Baby.

200
00:08:42,654 --> 00:08:44,854
- Cheers to Dr. Kersey.
- Thank you.

201
00:08:44,856 --> 00:08:46,922
How about two Kerseys
that aren't doctors?

202
00:08:46,924 --> 00:08:49,528
- How about cheers to us?
- Non-doctors.

203
00:08:50,828 --> 00:08:53,498
I wanna get the big puffy
jackets, UGG slippers...

204
00:09:02,073 --> 00:09:03,339
How much?

205
00:09:03,341 --> 00:09:04,409
Two grand.

206
00:09:06,043 --> 00:09:08,512
What? Two grand, what?
Hey, man.

207
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:10,546
You know, I've been
convicted of a crime.

208
00:09:10,548 --> 00:09:12,384
I mean, it's not like
I'm a criminal, but...

209
00:09:13,785 --> 00:09:15,420
This cashmere?

210
00:09:18,423 --> 00:09:19,890
It's okay.

211
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,257
All right, thanks, man.

212
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:22,727
Pauly, thank you.

213
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:25,664
No worries.

214
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,032
He's got the money. Not me.

215
00:09:30,034 --> 00:09:31,437
Hey, thank you so much.

216
00:09:32,571 --> 00:09:33,873
MJ.

217
00:09:34,405 --> 00:09:35,972
Bulls fan?

218
00:09:35,974 --> 00:09:37,440
No, it's my name.

219
00:09:37,442 --> 00:09:39,209
- Miguel Javier.
- Ah.

220
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:40,544
I know, I know, I know!

221
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:41,878
La Bamba, at 1:00. I got it.

222
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,979
Love you!

223
00:09:42,981 --> 00:09:44,881
- It's La Fonda.
- At 8:00, okay?

224
00:09:44,883 --> 00:09:45,982
Three o'clock.
I got it.

225
00:09:45,984 --> 00:09:48,251
Wednesday, 8:00, La Fonda.

226
00:09:48,253 --> 00:09:50,621
All right, I wouldn't
forget a restaurant like that.

227
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,625
- See you guys.
- Bye.

228
00:10:17,849 --> 00:10:20,016
Wow, you look nice.

229
00:10:20,018 --> 00:10:21,019
So do you.

230
00:10:22,654 --> 00:10:24,054
Do you like
your present?

231
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:25,289
Yes.

232
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,922
- Aw.
- And I love you.

233
00:10:26,924 --> 00:10:28,860
Aw.

234
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,631
Oh, and who is this calling?

235
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:35,634
Oh, no.

236
00:10:38,803 --> 00:10:42,207
Hi, Susan.
Yes, he's right here.

237
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:44,110
You guys ready?

238
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:48,611
Hi, Susan.

239
00:10:48,613 --> 00:10:50,416
I was just trying on
my birthday present.

240
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:53,953
No, I had worked it out
with Terry.

241
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:55,920
He's...

242
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,259
Okay.

243
00:11:03,261 --> 00:11:05,296
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, see you soon.

244
00:11:06,431 --> 00:11:08,665
Terry has a 104 fever.

245
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:10,599
So, no birthday dinner
at La Fonda?

246
00:11:10,601 --> 00:11:11,603
Mmm-mmm.

247
00:11:14,371 --> 00:11:16,906
I'll go tell Uncle Frank.

248
00:11:16,908 --> 00:11:19,374
- Sorry, Daddy.
- Oh, it's all right, hon.

249
00:11:19,376 --> 00:11:21,545
I just had my heart set
on that tres leches cake.

250
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:23,379
I know, me, too.
We'll have it soon.

251
00:11:23,381 --> 00:11:24,382
All right, baby.

252
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:29,288
We will celebrate
tomorrow night.

253
00:11:31,722 --> 00:11:33,625
Don't worry at all, I promise.

254
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:35,458
Try and stay awake.

255
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,861
Okay, I will.

256
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,862
- Okay. I'm sorry.
- I will. Bye, honey.

257
00:11:39,864 --> 00:11:41,200
It's all right.

258
00:11:45,503 --> 00:11:46,504
<i>Hey, Paul.</i>

259
00:11:47,538 --> 00:11:48,972
Happy birthday, old man.

260
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,206
Oh, come on.

261
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51,874
- First baseline.
- You don't get me anything.

262
00:11:51,876 --> 00:11:53,676
You better be taking me
to that game.

263
00:12:12,597 --> 00:12:15,165
Why can't we just Postmates
La Fonda? It's so much easier.

264
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,233
Our cake is gonna be
so much better

265
00:12:17,235 --> 00:12:19,002
because we're gonna make it
with love.

266
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,704
Yeah, but La Fonda makes it
with love.

267
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:22,604
And we know that
Dad already loves it,

268
00:12:22,606 --> 00:12:24,007
so it's kind of a win-win.

269
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:25,441
No, it's his birthday.

270
00:12:25,443 --> 00:12:28,512
He's gonna love knowing that
we actually made the effort.

271
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:29,778
We did the work.

272
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,015
So we can make the effort
to dirty up the kitchen,

273
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:33,182
and then when he gets home,

274
00:12:33,184 --> 00:12:34,251
we just pretend that
we cooked all night.

275
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,621
Honey, we're making the cake.

276
00:12:39,957 --> 00:12:41,358
Honey,
could you get me my iPad?

277
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,392
I think it's upstairs
on the nightstand.

278
00:12:43,394 --> 00:12:44,927
Sure.

279
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:45,930
Thank you.

280
00:12:51,102 --> 00:12:53,536
Hi, Soph.

281
00:12:53,538 --> 00:12:55,073
I can't hear you.

282
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,515
Okay, so I've narrowed it
down to two options.

283
00:13:05,517 --> 00:13:08,618
I'm thinking either
Third North or Seventh Street.

284
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,052
Third North has bigger bedrooms

285
00:13:10,054 --> 00:13:11,555
but I think that
Seventh Street is just, like,

286
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:12,758
a way cooler area.

287
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:52,963
Honey, did you get that iPad?

288
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:54,934
Yeah, it was in your dresser,
not on it.

289
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:23,195
Jordan? Can you please
come down here? I need it.

290
00:14:37,008 --> 00:14:38,842
Jordan, come down here,
right now.

291
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:42,045
Mom, I am grabbing a charger,
relax.

292
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,546
So what are you guys
gonna do tonight?

293
00:14:43,548 --> 00:14:44,948
Jordan!

294
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,282
Oh, my God. Will you calm down?
I said I'm coming.

295
00:14:47,284 --> 00:14:48,450
Now!

296
00:14:48,452 --> 00:14:49,651
I'm gonna have to
call you back.

297
00:14:49,653 --> 00:14:51,287
My mom is being a total psycho.

298
00:14:53,524 --> 00:14:55,293
No!

299
00:15:03,567 --> 00:15:05,902
Mom.

300
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:08,106
Put the fucking phone down
right now.

301
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,708
No.

302
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,512
Please. Please don't hurt her.

303
00:15:15,013 --> 00:15:17,012
Don't hurt her, please!

304
00:15:17,014 --> 00:15:18,082
Shh.

305
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:21,883
Shh. Shh.

306
00:15:21,885 --> 00:15:24,954
Now here's, uh,
here's what's gonna happen.

307
00:15:24,956 --> 00:15:26,656
Mom, you're gonna save me
20 minutes

308
00:15:26,658 --> 00:15:27,757
by opening the safe.

309
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:28,959
Okay.

310
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:30,725
Then I'm gonna tie you up
with your daughter,

311
00:15:30,727 --> 00:15:32,963
so you won't be calling anyone
till we're long gone.

312
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:34,064
Okay.

313
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:35,498
Now if you could do that,
nobody gets hurt.

314
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,565
Okay.

315
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:38,033
- You understand me?
- Mmm-hmm.

316
00:15:38,035 --> 00:15:39,670
Go on.

317
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,537
Mom, Mom!

318
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:44,074
Don't hurt her.
Do not hurt her.

319
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:45,677
Oh, that's entirely up to you.

320
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,412
It's okay, Mom.
Just do it. Just go.

321
00:15:49,414 --> 00:15:51,079
Tie her up.

322
00:15:51,081 --> 00:15:53,682
No fucking games.

323
00:15:53,684 --> 00:15:54,886
We need to move.

324
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:02,792
Hey.

325
00:16:02,794 --> 00:16:04,960
Hey, no fucking games.
What, are you deaf?

326
00:16:04,962 --> 00:16:06,262
Put that thing away.

327
00:16:06,264 --> 00:16:08,433
All right, man. Relax.

328
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,166
Jesus.

329
00:16:10,168 --> 00:16:11,803
Just fucking watch her.

330
00:16:15,273 --> 00:16:18,742
My husband has two watches,
there's cash...

331
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,542
You can take it all.
Whatever you want.

332
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:22,814
That's nice. Thank you.

333
00:16:30,121 --> 00:16:31,122
Where's the rope, girl?

334
00:16:33,491 --> 00:16:34,826
Check the garage.

335
00:16:55,312 --> 00:16:57,680
Don't get amnesia on me.

336
00:16:57,682 --> 00:16:59,482
I'm sorry. I'm just
not used to doing it

337
00:16:59,484 --> 00:17:00,751
with a gun pointed at me.

338
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:02,754
Yeah, well, get used to it.

339
00:17:12,964 --> 00:17:14,665
You play sports?

340
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,341
You look like you play sports.

341
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,674
No.

342
00:17:25,676 --> 00:17:27,413
- Shh.
- No, no, stop.

343
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,215
Did you say something?

344
00:17:31,249 --> 00:17:32,649
Please don't.

345
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:33,652
Please don't.

346
00:17:46,097 --> 00:17:47,331
Oh, you can do it.

347
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,835
And then we're done.

348
00:17:51,569 --> 00:17:54,069
Goddamn, you're strong.

349
00:17:55,339 --> 00:17:56,574
That's good.

350
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,409
No.

351
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,809
- No, no, no.
- Please.

352
00:18:00,811 --> 00:18:02,680
It's nice. It's nice.
It's good.

353
00:18:06,818 --> 00:18:07,819
I got it.

354
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:27,569
Hey. Hey, what the fuck
is your rush, bro?

355
00:18:27,571 --> 00:18:29,604
We don't have time
for this shit.

356
00:18:29,606 --> 00:18:31,641
Just give me
two fucking minutes, please.

357
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:33,241
I'm begging you,
two minutes, please.

358
00:18:33,243 --> 00:18:36,077
It's not that kind
of a party, all right?

359
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:38,648
Why don't you just stop
being such a fucking pussy?

360
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,486
What the fuck?
What the fuck, man?

361
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:45,455
God damn it!

362
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,458
Fuck!

363
00:18:49,326 --> 00:18:51,126
Fuck! God damn it!

364
00:18:51,128 --> 00:18:53,129
- You motherfucker!
- No!

365
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:55,230
- No! No!
- The fuck are you doing?

366
00:18:55,232 --> 00:18:56,865
She cut my fucking face!

367
00:18:56,867 --> 00:18:58,769
She can see your fucking face!

368
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,272
Mom!

369
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:05,878
Jordan, run!

370
00:19:06,877 --> 00:19:07,977
Fuck it.

371
00:19:14,152 --> 00:19:16,452
<i>Trauma,
two incoming, Level One.</i>

372
00:19:16,454 --> 00:19:18,822
<i>Female, 17,
basal skull fracture.</i>

373
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:22,057
<i>Female, 43,
gunshot wound to the chest.</i>

374
00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:24,293
Dr. Simone, would you mind
closing, please?

375
00:19:24,295 --> 00:19:25,831
Yes, doctor.

376
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:27,830
Put her on the monitor.

377
00:19:27,832 --> 00:19:28,931
Get two IV's
and put her on oxygen.

378
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:30,400
Yes.

379
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:31,968
Jordan, open your
eyes. Open your eyes, Jordan.

380
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,068
She needs to be intubated.

381
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,539
Prepare 100 milligrams
of propofol...

382
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,613
Doc, hold up, man.

383
00:19:44,615 --> 00:19:46,149
It's fine, it's fine.

384
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:48,683
Listen. Paul,
something's happened.

385
00:19:48,685 --> 00:19:51,353
You can't go in there.

386
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,259
Where are they?

387
00:19:57,261 --> 00:19:58,494
Paul. Paul.

388
00:19:58,496 --> 00:20:00,662
Where is she?

389
00:20:00,664 --> 00:20:02,632
They took your daughter
up to surgery, doc.

390
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:04,700
Your wife's in Two.

391
00:20:04,702 --> 00:20:05,971
Lucy!

392
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:12,808
Paul...

393
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,512
We did everything we could.

394
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,420
Baby.

395
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,630
<i>Our passports,
Jordan's birth certificate,</i>

396
00:21:07,632 --> 00:21:09,534
$2,000 in cash...

397
00:21:12,069 --> 00:21:14,237
My Stanford class ring,

398
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:16,642
two Panerai watches
on the desk.

399
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,611
Can you describe the watches?

400
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:22,644
One was all black.

401
00:21:22,646 --> 00:21:24,348
The other one...

402
00:21:26,384 --> 00:21:30,753
It was a birthday present.
Silver and black.

403
00:21:30,755 --> 00:21:32,622
Were there any firearms
in the house?

404
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,222
No.

405
00:21:34,224 --> 00:21:35,824
A lot of these guys,

406
00:21:35,826 --> 00:21:38,994
they break in looking for guns
'cause they're easy to sell.

407
00:21:38,996 --> 00:21:40,563
I had a couple of assholes
break in

408
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,198
to my house looking for mine.

409
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,565
So that's
what you think this was?

410
00:21:43,567 --> 00:21:45,267
It was a robbery gone bad?

411
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:46,735
Well, there have been
a string of break-ins

412
00:21:46,737 --> 00:21:47,836
along the North Shore.

413
00:21:47,838 --> 00:21:49,439
So we're looking at
the possibility.

414
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:51,108
You said string.
How many in this string?

415
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:55,276
Uh, six,
in the last nine months.

416
00:21:55,278 --> 00:21:59,282
Six? Six robberies.
Did you know about this?

417
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:00,783
No, I didn't know about it.

418
00:22:00,785 --> 00:22:01,984
What, you don't think
it's important enough

419
00:22:01,986 --> 00:22:03,251
to tell the residents?

420
00:22:03,253 --> 00:22:05,854
We post every crime
on the Neighborhood Watch.

421
00:22:05,856 --> 00:22:07,088
If it's big enough,

422
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,257
the media picks it up
and reports about it.

423
00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:10,392
If not,
these are just burglaries.

424
00:22:10,394 --> 00:22:12,161
Just burglaries.

425
00:22:12,163 --> 00:22:13,261
Frank, that's not
what he meant.

426
00:22:13,263 --> 00:22:14,564
No, I'm just wondering,

427
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:16,932
if it's important enough
now, to go on their radar...

428
00:22:16,934 --> 00:22:18,601
You're not helping.

429
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:20,703
You guys,
it's been a long night.

430
00:22:20,705 --> 00:22:22,571
I think we got enough
to start with.

431
00:22:22,573 --> 00:22:24,039
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

432
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:25,708
This is my card.

433
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:26,808
Thanks.

434
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:28,444
It's got my cell phone
number on there,

435
00:22:28,446 --> 00:22:30,947
if you've got anything else.

436
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:32,718
Thank you, Detective Raines.

437
00:22:33,951 --> 00:22:35,619
You know, I... I get that
you're upset.

438
00:22:37,121 --> 00:22:39,321
We're upset, too.

439
00:22:39,323 --> 00:22:41,426
But we're gonna get these guys.

440
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:48,029
Again, I'm... I'm
deeply sorry for your loss.

441
00:22:48,031 --> 00:22:49,731
- Thank you.
- Thanks for your time.

442
00:22:49,733 --> 00:22:52,701
Dr. Kersey, your daughter's
out of surgery.

443
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,008
Her surgery went well.

444
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,679
She's still in a coma,
but she's stable.

445
00:23:02,346 --> 00:23:04,313
They were able
to evacuate the hematoma

446
00:23:04,315 --> 00:23:06,051
and remove
the bullet fragments.

447
00:23:07,818 --> 00:23:09,721
I wish I had more to tell you.

448
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:24,001
So, I gotta take Mom home
to Grandpa today.

449
00:23:26,237 --> 00:23:29,508
Uncle Frank's gonna take
over reading duties for now.

450
00:23:31,342 --> 00:23:36,480
I love you so much.
Oh, so much, baby.

451
00:23:38,883 --> 00:23:40,885
I'll see you soon, kiddo.

452
00:23:42,686 --> 00:23:44,923
When Lucy's mother passed,

453
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:48,224
she turned to me and said,

454
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:50,595
"Why did God take her so soon?"

455
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:56,899
All I could say was,
"Honey, I don't know.

456
00:23:56,901 --> 00:23:59,901
I think it's part of His plan.

457
00:23:59,903 --> 00:24:02,307
And we have to trust
His plan."

458
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:10,148
We used to come up here
and visit her and...

459
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,051
Well...

460
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:19,054
Now here I am.

461
00:24:19,056 --> 00:24:22,894
And I'm seeing something
I was never meant to see.

462
00:24:24,394 --> 00:24:27,465
How is this part of His plan?

463
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:31,570
How is this part of any plan?

464
00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:41,480
Thank you, Paul,
for bringing her home.

465
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:47,249
This is where she wanted
to be. With her mom.

466
00:24:47,251 --> 00:24:48,787
One day, I'll join 'em.

467
00:24:50,321 --> 00:24:52,490
There'll always be
a place here for you.

468
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:56,292
Thanks.

469
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:59,026
Have the police
gotten anywhere?

470
00:24:59,028 --> 00:25:03,434
One of the neighbors saw three
repairmen in a white van.

471
00:25:04,468 --> 00:25:06,035
The police seem
pretty confident.

472
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,698
Oh, damn. Run!

473
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:38,602
Poachers! Come on!

474
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,376
Go, go!

475
00:25:54,251 --> 00:25:57,788
People rely on the police
to keep them safe.

476
00:25:59,656 --> 00:26:01,692
That's the problem.

477
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:03,859
The police only arrive

478
00:26:03,861 --> 00:26:06,331
after the crime
has taken place.

479
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:08,365
That's like...

480
00:26:09,433 --> 00:26:11,167
Trapping the fox

481
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:13,271
as he's comin' out
of the hen house.

482
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:19,174
If a man really wants to
protect what's his...

483
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:23,448
He has to do it for himself.

490

491
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:42,197
<i>The numbers are up.</i>

492
00:26:42,199 --> 00:26:44,366

493
00:26:44,368 --> 00:26:46,067
<i>I'm sorry, Dr.
Kersey, nothing yet.</i>

494
00:26:46,069 --> 00:26:47,436
Nothing?

495

<i>Don't be alarmed.
It's not uncommon.</i>

496
00:26:49,105 --> 00:26:50,873
<i>Forensics usually takes a week

497
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,376
<i>Uh, same with informants.</i>

498
00:26:53,376 --> 00:26:55,411
Hey!

499
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:57,845
I'm sorry. Some asshole's
trying to clean my windshield.

500
00:26:57,847 --> 00:27:00,181
Hey, that's enough. Go on.

501

<i>Run 'em over.
Doesn't count as a crime.</i>

00:27:02,385 --> 00:27:03,686

503
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:05,487
<i>Look, I have someone

504

505
00:27:07,191 --> 00:27:08,958

506
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,392
<i>We'll get back to you as soon

- Yep.

508
00:27:14,131 --> 00:27:18,433
- Fuck you!
- Yes, fuck me.

509

Sophie.

515
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,419
- Hi.
- Dr. Kersey, hi.

516
00:27:35,618 --> 00:27:36,919
The nurses let me come in here.

517
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:37,922
No, it's okay.

518
00:27:38,622 --> 00:27:40,291
I'm glad you're here.

519
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:42,690
How are you doing?

520
00:27:42,692 --> 00:27:45,760
I'm okay. How are you?

521
00:27:45,762 --> 00:27:48,363
Doing okay. Thank you.

522
00:27:48,365 --> 00:27:50,365
What are you reading?

523
00:27:50,367 --> 00:27:55,336
Um, <i>Essays in Positive
Economics</i> by Milton Friedman.

524
00:27:55,338 --> 00:27:57,707
I'm not sure that's
gonna help her wake up.

525
00:27:57,709 --> 00:28:00,543
Yeah, I know, it's boring.

526
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:01,709
Um...

527
00:28:01,711 --> 00:28:03,645
But it's on
the NYU summer reading list

528
00:28:03,647 --> 00:28:05,649
and I'm reading it
anyway, so...

529
00:28:07,351 --> 00:28:09,721
I thought, I don't know,
maybe this way...

530
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:12,791
This way, she won't get behind.

531
00:28:15,459 --> 00:28:17,125
I can leave, if you want.

532
00:28:17,127 --> 00:28:20,397
No, no. Stay. Stay.

533
00:28:21,531 --> 00:28:22,533
It'd be good for her.

534
00:28:25,135 --> 00:28:26,471
Dr. Kersey...

535
00:28:28,806 --> 00:28:30,706
Do you think it helps?

536
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:32,509
I know it does.

537
00:28:37,213 --> 00:28:39,183
I can't sleep on our bed.

538
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:44,722
So I sleep on the couch.
I watch TV until I pass out.

539
00:28:47,758 --> 00:28:50,225
Even then I...

540
00:28:50,227 --> 00:28:52,193
I'm just not getting any sleep.

541
00:28:52,195 --> 00:28:54,563
That's to be expected.

542
00:28:54,565 --> 00:28:58,199
I can prescribe sleeping pills
if it gets worse.

543
00:28:58,201 --> 00:29:00,869
I feel like I'm in purgatory.

544
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:05,043
I can't go back to work,
I can't be around my house.

545
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:10,412
When I was a kid,

546
00:29:10,414 --> 00:29:13,617
I used to ride the trains
to avoid my father.

547
00:29:15,618 --> 00:29:18,085
<i>And I would
even do my homework then,</i>

548
00:29:18,087 --> 00:29:20,524
<i>just to stay away from him.</i>

549
00:29:22,726 --> 00:29:23,762
<i>So...</i>

550
00:29:24,961 --> 00:29:27,161
<i>I've been doing that.</i>

551
00:29:27,163 --> 00:29:29,032
<i>Just riding the trains...</i>

552
00:29:31,568 --> 00:29:33,070
<i>Just to think.</i>

553
00:29:39,576 --> 00:29:42,980
<i>I wish I could say everything
I see reminds me of Lucy.</i>

554
00:29:44,882 --> 00:29:48,350
<i>But everything I see
reminds me of them.</i>

555
00:29:48,352 --> 00:29:50,421
<i>The men I've never seen.</i>

556
00:29:55,993 --> 00:29:57,995
<i>The men who came
and took her from me.</i>

557
00:30:00,096 --> 00:30:01,730
<i>This is Detective Kevin Raines</i>

558

00:30:54,951 --> 00:30:57,055
No. It's not a "U."

"E."

K-E-R-S-E-Y.

578
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:05,294

Yes.

582
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:13,067
This is a process.

583
00:31:13,069 --> 00:31:14,437
And it's gonna take time.

584
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:15,874
Yeah, I know it's a process.

585
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:19,143
I'm just...

586
00:31:21,178 --> 00:31:24,549
Starting to wonder
about the result, that's all.

587

Listen,
I understand the process

589
00:31:42,933 --> 00:31:44,932
Just fill out all the boxes

Hello, sir.
Fill out this application,

every single box, please.

593
00:32:20,837 --> 00:32:21,969
Sir, can I help you?

594
00:32:21,971 --> 00:32:24,273
Yeah, I'm here
to see Detective Raines.

595
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,441
Detective Raines. Do you have
an appointment, sir?

596
00:32:26,443 --> 00:32:27,575
No. No, I don't.

597
00:32:27,577 --> 00:32:29,247
My name is Paul Kersey.

598
00:32:30,513 --> 00:32:32,315
K-U-R...

599
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:33,414
E-R...

600
00:32:33,416 --> 00:32:34,583
- Sorry about that.
- It's all right.

601
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:36,754
Hey, Dr. Kersey.
Dr. Kersey, come on back.

602
00:32:37,454 --> 00:32:39,054
Thank you. Thanks.

603
00:32:39,056 --> 00:32:40,422
Buzz him in, Willy.

604
00:32:40,424 --> 00:32:41,992
Yeah.

605
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:48,263
What about the DNA
in the blood and skin

606
00:32:48,265 --> 00:32:49,998
from the guy that got burned?

607
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,266
We got that test back.

608
00:32:51,268 --> 00:32:53,334
It didn't match anybody
in our database.

609
00:32:53,336 --> 00:32:54,569
But we can use it
to put 'em there

610
00:32:54,571 --> 00:32:56,073
when we get one in custody.

611
00:32:58,709 --> 00:32:59,711
Yeah, Raines.

612
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:02,880
Get a number,
I'll call him back.

613
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:11,719
CCA?

614
00:33:11,721 --> 00:33:13,724
Cleared. Closed by arrest.

615
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:19,030
So all these other ones
are open cases?

616
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:20,798
Yep.

617
00:33:23,166 --> 00:33:24,732
Most of these are gang-related.

618
00:33:24,734 --> 00:33:26,802
Just asshole-on-asshole
violence.

619
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:29,505
Some banger posts some shit
on social media

620
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,676
and they retaliate
with an AR-15.

621
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:35,611
Last weekend,
a guy shot up a party.

622
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:41,315
One guy shoots 14 people,
no one sees anything.

623
00:33:41,317 --> 00:33:44,221
They don't talk to the cops,
that's why these stay open.

624
00:33:46,355 --> 00:33:49,527
Point is, your wife's case
is different.

625
00:33:51,327 --> 00:33:52,861
You wanna have a seat?

626
00:33:52,863 --> 00:33:53,865
Thanks.

627
00:33:55,365 --> 00:33:58,299
I mean, that's three
burglars who panicked.

628
00:33:58,301 --> 00:33:59,834
I guarantee at least
one of 'em

629
00:33:59,836 --> 00:34:01,970
is shittin' himself somewhere.

630
00:34:01,972 --> 00:34:03,372
He's got a friend
who's gonna get picked up

631
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,940
on something unrelated.

632
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:07,642
He's gonna sell his buddy down
the river for his own freedom.

633
00:34:07,644 --> 00:34:09,010
Okay?

634
00:34:09,012 --> 00:34:11,313
I've seen guys
turn in their own mother.

635
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:13,782
What if I offered
some kind of reward?

636
00:34:13,784 --> 00:34:15,883
We'll just get flooded
with false leads.

637
00:34:15,885 --> 00:34:17,318
Me and my partner
are gonna have to

638
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,387
waste time tracking 'em down.

639
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:22,057
What about
a private investigator?

640
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:26,695
PI's good for cheating
spouses, missing persons...

641
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:29,430
But murder case,
they'll just take your money.

642
00:34:29,432 --> 00:34:32,066
They can't get involved
in a police investigation.

643
00:34:32,068 --> 00:34:35,637
It's tampering with evidence,
they could lose their license.

644
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,972
So there's nothing
that I can do.

645
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:38,874
Is that what you're saying?

646
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:40,745
You can have faith.

647
00:34:46,416 --> 00:34:48,552
How'd faith work out for them?

648
00:34:50,086 --> 00:34:52,688
<i>This is
Lake transfer to Orange...</i>

649
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:55,025
<i>Green, Purple, and Brown.</i>

650
00:34:58,195 --> 00:34:59,831
<i>This is Red Line train
to Howard.</i>

651
00:35:02,432 --> 00:35:03,701
Oh, shit!

652
00:35:05,268 --> 00:35:06,534
Damn, what's up, baby?

653
00:35:06,536 --> 00:35:07,702
Hey, mama.

654
00:35:07,704 --> 00:35:09,304
What's poppin', redbone?

655
00:35:09,306 --> 00:35:11,273
Look at you.
Where you going, baby?

656
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,773
Can I come with you?

657
00:35:12,775 --> 00:35:15,075
Look at your fine ass.
Look at them thick-ass thighs.

658
00:35:15,077 --> 00:35:16,445
Can I get your number, baby?
Can I call?

659
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,648
Hey!

660
00:35:19,949 --> 00:35:21,782
What the fuck you say, <i>puto?</i>

661
00:35:21,784 --> 00:35:23,117
Just leave her alone.

662
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:25,086
Fuck you talking to?

663
00:35:25,088 --> 00:35:27,054
Just leave her alone.

664
00:35:27,056 --> 00:35:28,192
What the fuck is your problem?

665
00:35:29,659 --> 00:35:30,758
Punk-ass.

666
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,063
Who the fuck you think you are?

667
00:35:52,782 --> 00:35:56,150
<i>I don't shoot to kill,
I shoot to stay alive.</i>

668
00:35:56,152 --> 00:35:59,753
<i>Law-abiding criminals
don't exist.</i>

669
00:35:59,755 --> 00:36:01,992
<i>When seconds count,
cops are minutes away.</i>

670
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,461
<i>Come on down to Jolly Roger's.</i>

671
00:36:06,463 --> 00:36:09,430
<i>We've got some badass deals
on our F-1 firearms.</i>

672
00:36:09,432 --> 00:36:10,798
<i>Ooh, and right now,</i>

673
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,068
<i>we have a special
on our tactical furniture.</i>

674
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:15,269
<i>Surprise 'em.</i>

675
00:36:15,271 --> 00:36:17,438
Okay, here's a good one
for you. Easy on the...

676
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:22,280
No, no, hold it, son.

677
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:25,149
First gun?

678
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:27,849
Uh, yeah.

679
00:36:27,851 --> 00:36:29,452
It can be pretty overwhelming
at first.

680
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,452
I'll say.

681
00:36:31,454 --> 00:36:33,387
Don't worry, I got your
back. I'm Bethany.

682
00:36:33,389 --> 00:36:35,023
- Hi.
- Welcome to Jolly Roger's.

683
00:36:35,025 --> 00:36:36,126
Come on back,
let me show you around.

684
00:36:37,994 --> 00:36:40,929
So over here we have
all of our bladed weapons.

685
00:36:40,931 --> 00:36:43,030
Behind me on this wall
are all of our rifles.

686
00:36:43,032 --> 00:36:46,001
Each one comes with
a free case and two PMAGs.

687
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:47,635
And if you follow me over here,

688
00:36:47,637 --> 00:36:49,137
all of our new pistols
are over there.

689
00:36:49,139 --> 00:36:51,642
And all of our used weapons
are right here.

690
00:36:53,643 --> 00:36:55,376
- Used?
- Oh.

691
00:36:55,378 --> 00:36:58,646
Not used in crimes, obviously.
But, you know, used.

692
00:36:58,648 --> 00:37:00,380
I don't know where to begin.

693
00:37:00,382 --> 00:37:02,349
Well, personally,
my very favorite

694
00:37:02,351 --> 00:37:03,617
is right over here.

695
00:37:03,619 --> 00:37:04,786
Forgive me for asking,

696
00:37:04,788 --> 00:37:06,820
but what is the process
for all of this?

697
00:37:06,822 --> 00:37:08,623
There must be
a lot of paperwork, right?

698
00:37:08,625 --> 00:37:10,425
Oh.

699
00:37:10,427 --> 00:37:11,925
Don't even worry.

700
00:37:11,927 --> 00:37:13,095
We'll get you set up with

701
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:15,329
your FOID application
right here today.

702
00:37:15,331 --> 00:37:16,831
State Police send it
pretty quick.

703
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:19,200
And then you'll just have
to take a gun safety class,

704
00:37:19,202 --> 00:37:21,436
but don't worry,
no one ever fails.

705
00:37:21,438 --> 00:37:23,371
You can do that anytime
within 30 days

706
00:37:23,373 --> 00:37:25,173
of the time period you're
waiting for your city permit.

707
00:37:25,175 --> 00:37:26,708
And then it's just 72 hours,

708
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:29,878
and you're cocked, locked,
and ready to rock.

709
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,146
Ooh, and we can set you up
with a gun safe.

710
00:37:32,148 --> 00:37:33,481
If someone ever steals
that gun,

711
00:37:33,483 --> 00:37:35,552
those bullets can be traced
right back to you.

712
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:40,357
I'm gonna think about it...

713
00:37:41,057 --> 00:37:42,157
And I'll come back.

714
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:43,958
Great, just ask for Bethany.

715
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:49,066
<i>Dr. Kersey,
OR Two. Dr. Kersey, OR Two.</i>

716
00:37:51,501 --> 00:37:52,733
Put him on the monitor
and oxygen.

717
00:37:53,903 --> 00:37:55,369
On my count.

718
00:37:55,371 --> 00:37:57,074
Three, two, one.

719
00:37:59,009 --> 00:38:00,742
And breathe. Good.

720
00:38:00,744 --> 00:38:04,179
Blood's on its way.
Get an IV. Get his pants off.

721
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:06,516
Okay.
Take it easy, you're okay.

722
00:38:10,653 --> 00:38:12,155
You'll be all right, sir.

723
00:38:30,873 --> 00:38:32,706
<i>This is the Glock 17,</i>

724
00:38:32,708 --> 00:38:35,876
<i>arguably the most
iconic pistol of all time.</i>

725
00:38:35,878 --> 00:38:38,679
<i>Today, I'm gonna teach you
how to take it apart.</i>

726
00:38:38,681 --> 00:38:41,682
<i>Then put it back together
by simply reversing the steps.</i>

727
00:38:41,684 --> 00:38:45,720
<i>Put slight backwards pressure
on the slide,</i>

728
00:38:45,722 --> 00:38:47,722
<i>and the slide will release
forward.</i>

729
00:38:47,724 --> 00:38:49,590
<i>Step three, remove the barrel.</i>

730
00:38:49,592 --> 00:38:50,691
<i>Step three...</i>

731
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:21,722
<i>Brush from the
breach end of the barrel.</i>

732
00:39:21,724 --> 00:39:23,226
<i>I do this four
to five times or until...</i>

733
00:39:53,356 --> 00:39:55,590
<i>Dr. Kersey to ICU.</i>

734
00:39:55,592 --> 00:39:57,994
<i>Dr. Kersey,
please report to ICU.</i>

735
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:14,941
<i>She's had a seizure.</i>

736
00:40:14,943 --> 00:40:16,945
Is she gonna be okay?

737
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:18,713
The only thing we know for sure

738
00:40:18,715 --> 00:40:21,619
is her odds get less every day.

739
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:26,123
She's in handcuffs.

740
00:40:28,391 --> 00:40:30,460
My daughter is in handcuffs.

741
00:40:31,561 --> 00:40:34,329
And the men who did it
are out there.

742
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:36,033
Free.

743
00:40:39,001 --> 00:40:41,304
Look what these animals did
to my baby.

744
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:38,293
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

745
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:39,296
So...

746
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,099
Keys, now!

747
00:41:46,101 --> 00:41:47,702
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, man. Come on, man.

748
00:41:47,704 --> 00:41:48,936
Give it up, bitch.

749
00:41:48,938 --> 00:41:50,771
It's all right.
Come on, man.

750
00:41:50,773 --> 00:41:52,141
Hey!

751
00:42:02,418 --> 00:42:03,420
Ah!

752
00:43:18,628 --> 00:43:21,531
It's okay, it's okay,
get out of here. Go! Go!

753
00:44:17,619 --> 00:44:18,621
Move over.

754
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,313
<i>A rainy July...</i>

755
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:47,081
<i>Tickets
are now on sale for the...</i>

756
00:44:47,083 --> 00:44:48,148
<i>Chicago's
teacher's union</i>

757
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:49,152
<i>has taken the first step...</i>

758
00:45:06,568 --> 00:45:07,938
Hey!

759
00:45:12,275 --> 00:45:13,941
<i>I didn't know him.</i>

760
00:45:13,943 --> 00:45:15,646
He just came out of nowhere.

761
00:45:16,646 --> 00:45:18,248
He saved my life.

762
00:45:19,681 --> 00:45:21,284
Like a guardian angel.

763
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,458
<i>I heard that girl screaming</i>

764
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:33,028
and then
I heard tires squealing,

765
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:35,295
a whole bunch of shots
and then a crash.

766
00:45:35,297 --> 00:45:37,199
What about the shooter?

767
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:38,501
He looked like a white dude.

768
00:45:39,869 --> 00:45:41,469
He had a hoodie.

769
00:45:41,471 --> 00:45:44,304
It's the same description
the couple gave outside.

770
00:45:44,306 --> 00:45:45,673
White guy in a hoodie.

771
00:45:45,675 --> 00:45:47,775
They called him
a guardian angel.

772
00:45:47,777 --> 00:45:50,043
Yeah, more like
a Grim Reaper.

773
00:45:50,045 --> 00:45:51,345
I mean, did you see how

774
00:45:51,347 --> 00:45:53,180
he stood over that guy
and shot him?

775
00:45:53,182 --> 00:45:55,014
That shit was cold.

776
00:45:55,016 --> 00:45:56,486
Did you see his face?

777
00:45:56,885 --> 00:45:58,052
Mmm-mmm.

778
00:45:58,054 --> 00:46:01,157
How about marks
on his arms or tattoos?

779
00:46:01,657 --> 00:46:02,724
Mmm-mmm.

780
00:46:02,726 --> 00:46:05,894
So nothing that can help us?

781
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:08,796
It was dark. He was shooting.

782
00:46:08,798 --> 00:46:10,398
Um...

783
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,666
He kept waving his hand around
like this.

784
00:46:12,668 --> 00:46:13,967
Like his hand got shot?

785
00:46:13,969 --> 00:46:16,737
I don't know. Watch the video.

786
00:46:16,739 --> 00:46:18,972
I mean, you've seen as much
as I did.

787
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:21,979
- There!
- Yeah.

788
00:46:23,045 --> 00:46:24,177
It doesn't look like
it was shot.

789
00:46:24,179 --> 00:46:25,181
Hmm.

790
00:46:28,885 --> 00:46:31,052
No, that is the slide
kicking back

791
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:32,854
and cutting his hand

792
00:46:32,856 --> 00:46:34,755
because he doesn't know
how to hold a gun.

793
00:46:34,757 --> 00:46:37,391
So we're looking for a guy
who never fired a gun?

794
00:46:37,393 --> 00:46:39,894
Well, not in anger.

795
00:46:39,896 --> 00:46:42,095
Well, he has now.

796
00:46:42,097 --> 00:46:44,199
Natasha, listen,
we're gonna need you to

797
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:46,333
keep this video
confidential, okay?

798
00:46:46,335 --> 00:46:47,834
No posting on social media,

799
00:46:47,836 --> 00:46:49,371
and all that stuff you guys do.

800
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:51,405
I uploaded
that shit hours ago.

801
00:46:51,407 --> 00:46:52,842
I'm getting hits

Who wants gluten?

804
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:03,184
Oh, man, that's just cruel.

805
00:47:03,186 --> 00:47:04,286
A little support.

806
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:05,586
You know
you want a bear claw.

807

Yeah, I saw that guy

00:49:17,753 --> 00:49:19,322
but you should check on him.

849
00:49:20,423 --> 00:49:21,692
I'll check that.

850
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:26,896
This poor kid.
Got shot on the way to school.

851
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:30,197
Tyler.

852
00:49:30,199 --> 00:49:31,201
Mmm-hmm.

853
00:49:32,101 --> 00:49:35,503
Hi, Tyler. I'm Dr. Kersey.

854
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:37,673
I'm here to look at
your wound. Is that all right?

855
00:49:41,443 --> 00:49:44,347
I have my little
flashlight pen.

856

Let's take a look.

857
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:51,954
That must've hurt.

858
00:49:54,389 --> 00:49:56,225
A LeBron fan?

859
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,095
Me?

860
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:02,896
I'll always be a Jordan guy.

861
00:50:02,898 --> 00:50:08,903
He had swagger, he had style,
he could fly through the air.

862
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:13,807
Still, LeBron might be
the best ever.

863
00:50:13,809 --> 00:50:15,778
- Maybe.
- Yeah.

864
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,115
You got caught
in some crossfire?

865
00:50:21,284 --> 00:50:23,584
The Ice Cream Man done it.

866
00:50:23,586 --> 00:50:25,318
The Ice Cream Man?

867
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:28,155
Can't walk to school
if you don't work for him.

868
00:50:28,157 --> 00:50:29,259
Selling ice cream?

869
00:50:31,393 --> 00:50:32,428
Nah.

870
00:50:34,898 --> 00:50:37,834
He said next time,
it ain't gonna be my leg.

871
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:49,275
Tyler,
you are gonna be all right.

872
00:50:49,277 --> 00:50:51,113
I promise.

873
00:50:51,981 --> 00:50:53,514
Thanks.

874
00:50:53,516 --> 00:50:55,818
I'll see you
in a little while. All right?

875
00:50:56,318 --> 00:50:57,320
Okay.

876
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:18,338
- The cat, Tanisha.
- Word?

877
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:22,008
Yo, that's it, MUBU.

878
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:24,646
That's what I'm talkin' about.
Yeah, Tanisha.

879
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:29,486
That was next level business
she was doing.

880
00:51:31,621 --> 00:51:33,521
- Pimp out your crib?
- That's it.

881
00:51:33,523 --> 00:51:35,722
That's what I'm
talking about. Thank you.

882
00:51:35,724 --> 00:51:37,557
Yeah, so,
brought her up to my crib,

883
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:38,791
show him the picture...

884
00:51:38,793 --> 00:51:40,061
Of course I got mine,

885
00:51:40,063 --> 00:51:41,662
but show him the picture,
you'll see.

886
00:51:41,664 --> 00:51:44,801
- Let's see that cat, man.
- Hey, look here.

887
00:51:46,902 --> 00:51:49,072
You're the Ice Cream Man?

888
00:51:51,474 --> 00:51:53,407
Who the fuck are you?

889
00:51:53,409 --> 00:51:54,809
Your last customer.

890
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:57,043
Oh, shit!

891
00:52:03,418 --> 00:52:06,019
- Yo, give me that shit!
- Out my way.

892
00:52:06,021 --> 00:52:08,554
He was, uh...
He was white.

893
00:52:08,556 --> 00:52:10,190
A white guy, he had a hoodie...

894
00:52:10,192 --> 00:52:12,025
And that's all I know.

895
00:52:12,027 --> 00:52:13,728
- Was he tall? Short?
- Thanks.

896
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:16,530
- He was not short.
- Fat? Skinny?

897
00:52:16,532 --> 00:52:18,432
He was taller
than me, you know.

898
00:52:18,434 --> 00:52:20,235
I don't know.
He just went over there...

899
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:21,367
He was just some white guy.

900
00:52:21,369 --> 00:52:22,735
Let me guess,
white guy with a hoodie?

901
00:52:22,737 --> 00:52:24,237
Yeah, exactly.
White guy with a hoodie.

902
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:27,374
Fucking bullshit.
Nine witnesses, one story.

903
00:52:27,376 --> 00:52:29,075
The Grim Reaper.

904
00:52:29,077 --> 00:52:30,545
They say
he didn't take anything.

905
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:33,213
Just walked up,
shot the victim and left.

906
00:52:33,215 --> 00:52:35,215
That's Ray Shawn Core.

907
00:52:35,217 --> 00:52:37,617
Multiple drug offenses suspect
and three shootings.

908
00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:39,623
- Mmm, real community leader.
- Yeah.

909
00:52:41,623 --> 00:52:43,759
You really think
it's the same shooter?

910
00:52:46,427 --> 00:52:48,628
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!

911
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:50,733
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!

912
00:52:53,536 --> 00:52:54,871
Pull up that video.

913
00:52:55,771 --> 00:52:57,773
- Reaper?
- Yeah.

914
00:52:59,376 --> 00:53:01,945
- What hand does he shoot with?
- Hold up.

915
00:53:10,119 --> 00:53:12,956
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!

916

946

Detroit, New York.

948
00:54:34,503 --> 00:54:38,005
Everybody's nervous about
a copycat. Where are we?

949
00:54:38,007 --> 00:54:40,974
Well, we assume
the carjacking was random.

950
00:54:40,976 --> 00:54:42,075
Mmm-hmm.

951
00:54:42,077 --> 00:54:43,344
And our subject was just in

952
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:44,677
the wrong place
at the wrong time.

953
00:54:44,679 --> 00:54:46,847
- But he got a taste for it.
- Mmm-hmm.

954
00:54:46,849 --> 00:54:48,715
So we were trying to figure out

955
00:54:48,717 --> 00:54:50,485
how he selected
the second victim.

956
00:54:50,487 --> 00:54:52,420
- The drug dealer.
- Mmm-hmm.

957
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:54,822
Oh, we also know
he's left-handed.

958
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:57,325
Um, and we're pretty sure
he's not in the system.

959
00:54:57,327 --> 00:54:59,992
We figured that out
after the first shooting.

960
00:54:59,994 --> 00:55:03,563
Um, he had
a lack of basic weapon skills.

961
00:55:03,565 --> 00:55:04,898
To say the least.

962
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:06,200
Wow. Great.

963
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:09,536
You got it narrowed down
to about a million suspects.

964
00:55:09,538 --> 00:55:12,275
Detectives,
get off your fucking asses!

965
00:55:15,545 --> 00:55:17,077
He's pissed.

966
00:55:22,184 --> 00:55:23,349
You wanna tell me

967
00:55:23,351 --> 00:55:24,619
where we're gonna start looking

968
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:27,019
for our white needle
in the haystack?

969
00:55:27,021 --> 00:55:28,357
Not where.

970
00:55:29,391 --> 00:55:30,393
But when.

971
00:55:31,561 --> 00:55:32,729
I mean, why now?

972
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:34,961
What, uh...

973
00:55:34,963 --> 00:55:38,735
Lit the fuse
that set off our Mr. Reaper?

974
00:55:39,467 --> 00:55:41,136
You look much better.

975
00:55:42,704 --> 00:55:45,072
Thank you. I feel much better.

976
00:55:45,074 --> 00:55:46,409
You exercising?

977
00:55:47,409 --> 00:55:48,876
I do my push-ups.

978
00:55:48,878 --> 00:55:52,048
Mmm-hmm. Good.
Getting out? Socializing?

979
00:55:53,048 --> 00:55:54,050
Mmm...

980
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:56,050
Not so much.

981
00:55:56,052 --> 00:55:58,655
It's like you said.
It's a process.

982
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:00,722
Takes time.

983
00:56:00,724 --> 00:56:02,655
Well, whatever you're
doing, keep it up.

984
00:56:02,657 --> 00:56:04,958
Okay. I will.

985
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:12,432
Keep on bagging.
Push the O-neg.

986
00:56:12,434 --> 00:56:13,566
Got it!

987
00:56:13,568 --> 00:56:14,668
Give me
the ultrasound machine.

988
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:17,438
Hold compressions.
Give me the defib.

989
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,938
Charge to 300.

990
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:21,777
Jesus. I know this kid.

991
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,815
- Charged.
- Clear.

992
00:56:27,817 --> 00:56:30,450
- Continue bagging.
- Charge again to 300.

993
00:56:34,322 --> 00:56:35,424
<i>Charged.</i>

994
00:56:35,958 --> 00:56:36,960
Clear.

995
00:56:42,864 --> 00:56:45,200
Time of death, 9:35 p.m.

996
00:57:45,894 --> 00:57:47,396
Dr. Kersey?

997
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:49,866
Dr. Kersey?

998
00:58:10,219 --> 00:58:13,253
Wednesday, 8:00, La Fonda.

999
00:58:13,255 --> 00:58:14,289
See you guys.

1000
00:58:29,271 --> 00:58:31,104
<i>Hi.
This is Detective Kevin Raines</i>

1001
00:58:31,106 --> 00:58:33,106
<i>of the Chicago
Police Department.</i>

1002
00:58:33,108 --> 00:58:35,577
<i>If this is an emergency,
please dial 911.</i>

1003
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:04,941
What?

1004
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:07,442
You scared the shit out of me.

1005
00:59:08,943 --> 00:59:11,110
What are you doing here?

1006
00:59:11,112 --> 00:59:13,512
What do you mean?
I can't check on my niece?

1007
00:59:13,514 --> 00:59:16,148
And her dad who doesn't
return my texts?

1008
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:18,985
Yeah, yeah. Look, I'm sorry,
it's been a crazy week.

1009
00:59:18,987 --> 00:59:20,086
Yeah?

1010
00:59:20,088 --> 00:59:21,787
Still getting used
to being back.

1011
00:59:21,789 --> 00:59:23,055
You sleeping better?

1012
00:59:23,057 --> 00:59:24,291
'Cause I gotta tell you,
you still look like shit.

1013
00:59:24,293 --> 00:59:26,526
Thanks for your diagnosis,
Dr. Frank Kersey.

1014
00:59:26,528 --> 00:59:28,362
Go fuck yourself. Jesus.

1015
00:59:28,364 --> 00:59:30,363
Come on, let's go get a bite.
I'm buyin'.

1016
00:59:30,365 --> 00:59:32,599
- What, now?
- Hey, I'm back to work.

1017
00:59:32,601 --> 00:59:34,671
Union wages, no less. Come on.

1018
00:59:35,871 --> 00:59:37,436
Ah, no, no, I can't.

1019
00:59:37,438 --> 00:59:40,206
I got a meeting with
a bunch of hospital staff.

1020
00:59:40,208 --> 00:59:42,775
All right.
What about this weekend?

1021
00:59:42,777 --> 00:59:45,278
- We go get a bite. Yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's better.

1022
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,680
That's better.
I'll call you later, all right?

1023
00:59:47,682 --> 00:59:48,949
What's up with your hand here?

1024
00:59:48,951 --> 00:59:51,052
It's nothing, it's a scratch.
Leave it alone.

1025
00:59:51,054 --> 00:59:53,454
Look, do you need somethin'?

1026
00:59:53,456 --> 00:59:56,557
Some cash? What, some help?

1027
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:57,860
Is that what this is about?

1028
01:00:01,829 --> 01:00:04,130
- No.
- Frank.

1029
01:00:04,132 --> 01:00:05,298
Here, it's all right.

1030
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:07,534
Look, this is the $2,000
I owed you. Here you go.

1031
01:00:07,536 --> 01:00:08,802
It's all right.

1032
01:00:08,804 --> 01:00:10,037
I wanted to maybe take you
to lunch, you know.

1033
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:13,743
Celebrate that I can actually
pay you back.

1034
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:15,511
It's all right.

1035
01:00:16,644 --> 01:00:18,480
- Frank.
- Later, man.

1036
01:00:20,215 --> 01:00:21,751
- I'll see you.
- Yeah.

1037
01:01:18,606 --> 01:01:21,041
Hey, hey, buddy,
you can't be back here.

1038
01:01:21,043 --> 01:01:23,046
I'm looking for Trebol.

1039
01:01:24,246 --> 01:01:26,315
Well, you found him,
now you can get out.

1040
01:01:28,650 --> 01:01:31,251
Miguel sent me.

1041
01:01:31,253 --> 01:01:32,822
Who the fuck is Miguel?

1042
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:38,124
He works as a valet
at my restaurant.

1043
01:01:38,126 --> 01:01:42,065
He's got an MJ tattooed
on his wrist.

1044
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:48,271
He said you could help me find
a gift for my wife.

1045
01:01:49,405 --> 01:01:50,640
He works for you?

1046
01:01:51,273 --> 01:01:52,639
Yes.

1047
01:01:52,641 --> 01:01:54,641
At your restaurant?

1048
01:01:54,643 --> 01:01:56,012
Yes.

1049
01:01:57,512 --> 01:01:59,081
Yeah, all right. Sit down.

1050
01:02:03,918 --> 01:02:05,119
Hey.

1051
01:02:28,844 --> 01:02:29,978
So, uh...

1052
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:33,612
Is this a "thanks for
the years of service"

1053
01:02:33,614 --> 01:02:34,815
kind of thing, honey,

1054
01:02:34,817 --> 01:02:36,115
or is this more of

1055
01:02:36,117 --> 01:02:37,983
a "sorry, I boned the
babysitter" kind of thing?

1056
01:02:37,985 --> 01:02:38,987
Neither.

1057
01:02:54,902 --> 01:02:56,538
So you're looking
for something...

1058
01:02:58,007 --> 01:02:59,008
Specific?

1059
01:03:01,076 --> 01:03:02,641
Very specific.

1060
01:03:02,643 --> 01:03:04,478
Well, how specific
are we talking?

1061
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:08,317
Panerai watches.
You got any of those?

1062
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:11,017
Well, why don't you just
let me check

1063
01:03:11,019 --> 01:03:12,351
the reserve collection
over here,

1064
01:03:12,353 --> 01:03:13,720
because I think
there's something here

1065
01:03:13,722 --> 01:03:14,924
that might interest you.

1066
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:21,164
Drop it.

1067
01:03:22,264 --> 01:03:23,932
- Fuck! It's dropped.
- Kick it away.

1068
01:03:27,103 --> 01:03:29,735
I want my stuff.

1069
01:03:29,737 --> 01:03:31,704
It's in the back.

1070
01:03:31,706 --> 01:03:32,708
Keep moving.

1071
01:03:33,909 --> 01:03:35,074
Who's Fish?

1072
01:03:35,076 --> 01:03:37,177
He's just a drop guy.

1073
01:03:37,179 --> 01:03:40,079
Yeah. Your crew that stole
the shit out of my house!

1074
01:03:40,081 --> 01:03:43,050
You just described half
the shit in my shop, man.

1075
01:03:43,052 --> 01:03:44,284
And you killed my wife!

1076
01:03:44,286 --> 01:03:45,519
Look.

1077
01:03:45,521 --> 01:03:47,887
- Who are they?
- I just know Fish, okay?

1078
01:03:47,889 --> 01:03:50,523
I don't know the other
guys. I told you!

1079
01:03:50,525 --> 01:03:53,626
- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.
- It's all here. It's all here.

1080
01:03:53,628 --> 01:03:55,295
I don't organize it by house,

1081
01:03:55,297 --> 01:03:56,929
just take whatever's yours,
all right?

1082
01:03:56,931 --> 01:03:58,030
What, are you gonna talk?

1083
01:03:58,032 --> 01:03:59,199
Or are you gonna tell me
where my shit is?

1084
01:03:59,201 --> 01:04:00,534
It's here.

1085
01:04:00,536 --> 01:04:02,068
Where is it? I'm gonna blow
your fucking head off

1086
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:03,302
if you don't tell me...

1087
01:04:03,304 --> 01:04:06,408
What the... What is this?
What is this bullshit?

1088
01:04:07,742 --> 01:04:09,008
Now you're gonna tell me
where it is

1089
01:04:09,010 --> 01:04:11,478
in the next three seconds
or your head comes off.

1090
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,115
All right. It's all there.

1091
01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:18,453
You see this? You know
what it is, don't ya?

1092
01:04:19,253 --> 01:04:21,289
It was on my wife's arm.

1093
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:24,927
I hope it was worth it,
asshole.

1094
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:36,403
If I knew...

1095
01:04:36,405 --> 01:04:38,338
If I knew it was your shit,
I wouldn't have taken it, man.

1096
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:41,441
All my love for my wife
and my family is keeping me

1097
01:04:41,443 --> 01:04:43,309
from putting one
right in your fucking mouth.

1098
01:04:43,311 --> 01:04:46,079
I'm not a killer, okay?
I don't kill people.

1099
01:04:46,081 --> 01:04:47,783
It's not what I do.

1100
01:04:52,655 --> 01:04:53,789
Fuck!

1101
01:05:08,637 --> 01:05:09,772
Motherfucker!

1102
01:05:18,713 --> 01:05:20,215
Shit!

1103
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:27,487
Fuck!

1104
01:05:33,896 --> 01:05:34,897
Oh, shit!

1105
01:05:52,914 --> 01:05:54,983
Fuck!

1106
01:05:59,889 --> 01:06:01,057
Fuck!

1107
01:06:03,025 --> 01:06:04,691
Shit!

1108
01:06:06,862 --> 01:06:09,563
I didn't shoot her.
I didn't shoot her.

1109
01:06:09,565 --> 01:06:11,067
I promise, I didn't shoot her.

1110
01:06:14,737 --> 01:06:16,036
Fuck!

1111
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:17,773
- Who did?
- It wasn't me.

1112
01:06:20,342 --> 01:06:23,376
Fuck! Please!

1113
01:06:23,378 --> 01:06:25,278
- It wasn't me. It's Joe.
- What?

1114
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:26,512
- Joe!
- Joe who?

1115
01:06:26,514 --> 01:06:27,713
Joe Gannon!

1116
01:06:27,715 --> 01:06:29,950
The fat greasy fuck
at the auto body shop.

1117
01:06:29,952 --> 01:06:32,017
- Where's Joe?
- It's in my phone.

1118
01:06:32,019 --> 01:06:34,090
It's got pictures, everything.
I'll bring you to him.

1119
01:06:48,036 --> 01:06:49,038
Stupid motherfuck.

1120
01:07:09,590 --> 01:07:11,291
<i>Watch what
I do in the next few seconds.</i>

1121
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:12,626
<i>You might learn something</i>

1122
01:07:12,628 --> 01:07:14,561
<i>that could help you
solve your problem.</i>

1123
01:07:14,563 --> 01:07:16,262
<i>Grab this drill.</i>

1124
01:07:16,264 --> 01:07:18,430
<i>I'm going to drill
several holes</i>

1125
01:07:18,432 --> 01:07:20,001
<i>around this circle right here.</i>

1126
01:07:20,936 --> 01:07:22,269
<i>And when I do that,</i>

1127
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:25,838
<i>the information that's
inside of this metal box</i>

1128
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:28,443
<i>will be a lot harder to access.</i>

1129
01:07:34,016 --> 01:07:35,481
<i>With any luck, your metal box</i>

1130
01:07:35,483 --> 01:07:37,150
<i>should now look
something like this.</i>

1131
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:44,191
<i>Again, FBI, CIA, NSA, Interpol,</i>

1132
01:07:44,193 --> 01:07:47,659
<i>this video was strictly made
for entertainment purposes.</i>

1133
01:07:47,661 --> 01:07:49,597
<i>Stay out of trouble,
you crazy kids.</i>

1134
01:08:04,146 --> 01:08:05,347
Morning, Paul!

1135
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:12,385
<i>Reaper alert!</i>

1136
01:08:12,387 --> 01:08:13,887
<i>Reaper alert! Reaper alert!</i>

1137
01:08:13,889 --> 01:08:16,322
<i>Where's the Reaper?</i>

1138
01:08:16,324 --> 01:08:17,824
The Grim Reaper strikes again.

1139
01:08:17,826 --> 01:08:19,459
This time
in the Pilsen neighborhood.

1140
01:08:19,461 --> 01:08:21,126
In front of this liquor store,

1141
01:08:21,128 --> 01:08:24,296
which was a fencing operation
for stolen goods.

1142
01:08:24,298 --> 01:08:26,299
Not anymore, when last night,

1143
01:08:26,301 --> 01:08:28,668
the Grim Reaper
paid them a visit.

1144
01:08:28,670 --> 01:08:29,870
Dude, I look over, I see

1145
01:08:29,872 --> 01:08:31,571
this dude walking out,
this old white dude,

1146
01:08:31,573 --> 01:08:33,138
and he's walking
with his hood up,

1147
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:34,473
looking super suspicious.

1148
01:08:34,475 --> 01:08:36,343
Just like, you know...

1149
01:08:36,345 --> 01:08:38,077
Kind of idolizing him.
Man, right now,

1150
01:08:38,079 --> 01:08:39,678
this dude is all over
the Internet, man.

1151
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:41,880
- There's memes coming up.
- Get outta here.

1152
01:08:41,882 --> 01:08:43,517
Yeah, there's memes.
Like, people are making memes.

1153
01:08:43,519 --> 01:08:45,018
Look at this one right here.

1154
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:46,686
Oh, that's too intense.

1155
01:08:46,688 --> 01:08:47,853
He's become a folk hero.

1156
01:08:47,855 --> 01:08:49,322
He's a real hero
to these people.

1157
01:08:49,324 --> 01:08:50,822
They're being affected
by all this crime

1158
01:08:50,824 --> 01:08:52,025
in their neighborhood.

1159
01:08:52,027 --> 01:08:53,360
As long as it's not
in your neighborhood.

1160
01:08:53,362 --> 01:08:55,393
Clearly, if he didn't
just kill somebody,

1161
01:08:55,395 --> 01:08:56,495
I don't know what he did.

1162
01:08:56,497 --> 01:08:58,731
I still stand by my point that

1163
01:08:58,733 --> 01:09:01,534
we're normalizing
dangerous behavior.

1164
01:09:01,536 --> 01:09:03,536
You know? Should we be
policing ourselves

1165
01:09:03,538 --> 01:09:04,870
in our own neighborhoods...

1166
01:09:04,872 --> 01:09:07,607
I have said we need a guy
like Grim Reaper for years.

1167
01:09:07,609 --> 01:09:10,175
Are you Team Reaper or not?

1168
01:09:10,177 --> 01:09:11,844
Give us a call.
<i>Sway in the Morning</i>

1169
01:09:11,846 --> 01:09:13,882
at Shade 45, Sirius XM.

1170
01:09:31,733 --> 01:09:33,199
Dr. Kersey,

1171
01:09:33,201 --> 01:09:35,034
it's Detective Raines
and Jackson.

1172
01:09:35,036 --> 01:09:36,635
May we come in?

1173
01:09:36,637 --> 01:09:38,207
Of course. Come on in.

1174
01:09:40,809 --> 01:09:42,808
How you doing?
Sorry to drop in like this.

1175
01:09:42,810 --> 01:09:44,710
Oh, no.

1176
01:09:44,712 --> 01:09:46,278
Uh, something's
come to our attention.

1177
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:48,647
We were hoping you could
offer some insight.

1178
01:09:48,649 --> 01:09:50,416
I'm happy to see you guys.
Have a seat.

1179
01:09:50,418 --> 01:09:52,086
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

1180
01:09:53,255 --> 01:09:54,957
Okay, um...

1181
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:57,760
Have you ever seen this man?

1182
01:10:01,595 --> 01:10:02,597
No.

1183
01:10:03,465 --> 01:10:05,298
Is he a suspect?

1184
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:08,802
Well, his name is Tate Karp.
He goes by "The Fish."

1185
01:10:08,804 --> 01:10:11,737
He's a career burglar and,
we believe,

1186
01:10:11,739 --> 01:10:13,472
involved in
your wife's shooting.

1187
01:10:13,474 --> 01:10:15,411
How did you find him?

1188
01:10:16,145 --> 01:10:17,477
What did he say?

1189
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:20,345
Well, unfortunately,
he was killed last night

1190
01:10:20,347 --> 01:10:22,184
before we had a chance
to question him.

1191
01:10:23,786 --> 01:10:27,323
But we did find this ring
at the crime scene.

1192
01:10:31,826 --> 01:10:33,860
That's my ring.

1193
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:36,495
Yeah. That's what we thought.

1194
01:10:36,497 --> 01:10:38,999
Um, but this right here,

1195
01:10:39,001 --> 01:10:40,769
it's the break
we've been waiting for.

1196
01:10:42,170 --> 01:10:43,803
- It's great.
- Yeah.

1197
01:10:43,805 --> 01:10:46,039
Now that we have Karp,
it's just a matter of time

1198
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:47,840
before we have the rest of 'em.

1199
01:10:47,842 --> 01:10:50,376
We'll run through his priors,
see who he liked to work with,

1200
01:10:50,378 --> 01:10:52,544
subpoena his cell phone
records, his texts.

1201
01:10:52,546 --> 01:10:54,182
Even the phone's GPS.

1202
01:10:55,382 --> 01:10:59,152
Great. Do you need
anything else from me?

1203
01:10:59,154 --> 01:11:01,954
Appreciate that.
I think we're good for now.

1204
01:11:01,956 --> 01:11:04,290
Um... I know you've been
frustrated and I wanted to

1205
01:11:04,292 --> 01:11:06,858
come by in person
to give you the good news.

1206
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:10,362
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1207
01:11:10,364 --> 01:11:12,233
I told you to have faith.

1208
01:11:13,033 --> 01:11:14,467
Thanks for your time.

1209
01:11:14,469 --> 01:11:15,471
Thank you.

1210
01:12:13,694 --> 01:12:16,130
Yo, we're closed, pal.

1211
01:12:17,032 --> 01:12:18,534
You're Joey, right?

1212
01:12:21,036 --> 01:12:23,471
Yeah. Who the fuck are you?

1213
01:12:28,777 --> 01:12:31,279
Hey, fuckstick,
I said we were closed.

1214
01:12:56,438 --> 01:12:59,507
What the fuck?
Get me the fuck outta here.

1215
01:13:03,177 --> 01:13:05,077
Fuck! Get me the fuck
outta here, man!

1216
01:13:05,079 --> 01:13:06,614
- What the fuck are you...
- Shut the fuck up.

1217
01:13:08,216 --> 01:13:10,185
You're gonna tell me
what I wanna hear.

1218
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:17,525
You don't want this.
But guess what?

1219
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:20,093
You'll get some.

1220
01:13:20,095 --> 01:13:22,498
I'm just gonna help you out.

1221
01:13:24,431 --> 01:13:26,702
Trust me, I know where to cut.

1222
01:13:28,136 --> 01:13:29,968
Now right back here,
don't move...

1223
01:13:29,970 --> 01:13:32,671
...is your sciatic nerve.

1224
01:13:37,112 --> 01:13:40,282
Longest,
strongest nerve in the body.

1225
01:13:42,650 --> 01:13:43,652
Fuck!

1226
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:46,655
God damn!

1227
01:13:49,157 --> 01:13:50,623
You're that doctor.

1228
01:13:50,625 --> 01:13:52,491
I am that doctor.

1229
01:13:52,493 --> 01:13:54,129
But right now, I'm your doctor.

1230
01:13:55,128 --> 01:13:57,062
Your friend, Fish,
is already dead.

1231
01:13:57,064 --> 01:13:59,033
You can thank him
for giving you up.

1232
01:13:59,801 --> 01:14:03,135
No. No, no, no, no.

1233
01:14:03,137 --> 01:14:06,140
What I want to know
is who else was there.

1234
01:14:06,875 --> 01:14:07,973
Nobody.

1235
01:14:07,975 --> 01:14:09,209
Who else was there?

1236
01:14:09,211 --> 01:14:10,212
No one, man.

1237
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:19,818
What you're feeling
is a caustic agent

1238
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:22,888
being applied directly
to a nerve.

1239
01:14:25,527 --> 01:14:27,192
In med school,
we were taught that

1240
01:14:27,194 --> 01:14:28,995
this is the most
painful experience

1241
01:14:28,997 --> 01:14:30,228
that a person can endure

1242
01:14:30,230 --> 01:14:32,531
without possibly going into
cardiac arrest.

1243
01:14:32,533 --> 01:14:35,034
Please stop. It hurts.

1244
01:14:35,036 --> 01:14:36,835
The bad news is

1245
01:14:36,837 --> 01:14:39,438
you've got a shit ton
of brake fluid here.

1246
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:42,275
So we might be here all night.

1247
01:14:42,277 --> 01:14:44,246
Now you're gonna
start talking, aren't ya?

1248
01:14:45,546 --> 01:14:48,080
Knox! That's his name. Knox!

1249
01:14:48,082 --> 01:14:50,016
Knox. What's his full name?

1250
01:14:50,018 --> 01:14:51,884
I don't know
anything else, man!

1251
01:14:51,886 --> 01:14:54,254
His name is Knox and he's
from the South Side.

1252
01:14:54,256 --> 01:14:56,223
Look, Fish planned
the whole fucking thing!

1253
01:14:56,225 --> 01:14:57,857
I never met the guy before!

1254
01:14:57,859 --> 01:14:59,592
Where do I find Knox?

1255
01:14:59,594 --> 01:15:02,195
You don't. He finds you.

1256
01:15:02,197 --> 01:15:04,429
- Joe.
- I don't know anything else!

1257
01:15:04,431 --> 01:15:06,398
I swear to fucking God!

1258
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,934
I have no reason
to protect this asshole!

1259
01:15:08,936 --> 01:15:13,039
I don't even fucking know him!
You gotta believe me, please.

1260
01:15:13,041 --> 01:15:14,976
I fucking swear it!

1261
01:15:16,243 --> 01:15:17,813
I believe you, Joe.

1262
01:15:19,247 --> 01:15:22,417
I think you're gonna find
the propofol is wearing off.

1263
01:15:24,752 --> 01:15:26,088
Thanks for your help.

1264
01:15:34,229 --> 01:15:35,998
Fuck.

1265
01:15:38,899 --> 01:15:41,233
So you're not gonna kill me?

1266
01:15:41,235 --> 01:15:42,237
No.

1267
01:15:43,404 --> 01:15:44,405
The jack is.

1268
01:15:51,979 --> 01:15:54,647
Damn. Hell of a swing.

1269
01:15:54,649 --> 01:15:56,516
Lefty, no less.

1270
01:15:56,518 --> 01:15:57,849
Hey, Frank.

1271
01:15:57,851 --> 01:15:59,518
You know,
when I asked your supervisor

1272
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:01,588
where you like to
hang out after work,

1273
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:03,121
he told me here.

1274
01:16:03,123 --> 01:16:04,290
I thought he was
jerking my chain.

1275
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,692
Then I looked you up.

1276
01:16:07,694 --> 01:16:10,329
You were a legitimate prospect.

1277
01:16:10,331 --> 01:16:11,696
What happened?

1278
01:16:11,698 --> 01:16:13,366
So you want my autograph?

1279
01:16:13,368 --> 01:16:15,267
We just wanna talk.

1280
01:16:15,269 --> 01:16:16,602
All right.

1281
01:16:16,604 --> 01:16:19,539
Have you heard of this
Grim Reaper fellow

1282
01:16:19,541 --> 01:16:20,639
that people are talking about?

1283
01:16:20,641 --> 01:16:21,876
Yeah, yeah. I heard about it.

1284
01:16:23,145 --> 01:16:26,611
Well, last night,
he went into a liquor store.

1285
01:16:26,613 --> 01:16:28,680
And he killed
one of the three men

1286
01:16:28,682 --> 01:16:30,148
that broke into
your brother's house.

1287
01:16:30,150 --> 01:16:33,986
Traffic cam caught him walking
in and out. White, fit...

1288
01:16:33,988 --> 01:16:35,823
- Lefty.
- Lefty. Yeah. He's a lefty.

1289
01:16:36,890 --> 01:16:38,891
So I ask myself, you know,

1290
01:16:38,893 --> 01:16:41,794
"What streetwise lefty
do I know?"

1291
01:16:41,796 --> 01:16:43,195
You know,
the kind of guy that could

1292
01:16:43,197 --> 01:16:46,066
put word out
he would pay for info.

1293
01:16:46,068 --> 01:16:48,735
Would want to
execute our suspects.

1294
01:16:48,737 --> 01:16:52,972
A real do-it-himself
kind of guy.

1295
01:16:52,974 --> 01:16:55,842
So you think I had something
to do with it, huh?

1296
01:16:55,844 --> 01:16:57,209
Well, you should talk
to my brother.

1297
01:16:57,211 --> 01:17:00,379
He'll tell you
that I don't pay for shit.

1298
01:17:00,381 --> 01:17:04,318
Of course. So, do you mind
if we see your hands?

1299
01:17:12,527 --> 01:17:14,596
Hey!

1300
01:17:16,764 --> 01:17:19,098
<i>Tragedy struck earlier this
evening in West Englewood,</i>

1301
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:20,400
<i>where police think</i>

1302
01:17:20,402 --> 01:17:22,735
<i>a 49-year-old father of three
was killed</i>

1303
01:17:22,737 --> 01:17:25,604
<i>while trying to commit
vigilante justice.</i>

1304
01:17:25,606 --> 01:17:27,173
<i>Police believe
this was a copycat</i>

1305
01:17:27,175 --> 01:17:29,407
<i>of the so-called
"Chicago Grim Reaper."</i>

1306
01:17:29,409 --> 01:17:31,443
<i>A guy who went out,
tried to fight crime,</i>

1307
01:17:31,445 --> 01:17:33,545
<i>and ended up a victim himself.</i>

1308
01:17:33,547 --> 01:17:35,080
<i>Police are still looking
for the shooter.</i>

1309
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:02,141
This is Paul Kersey.

1310
01:18:02,143 --> 01:18:04,809
<i>I hear
you're looking for me.</i>

1311
01:18:04,811 --> 01:18:06,111
That's right.

1312
01:18:06,113 --> 01:18:09,214
<i>Come to Blowout.
Last club off Ashland.</i>

1313
01:18:09,216 --> 01:18:10,549
<i>I'll be waiting.</i>

1314
01:18:10,551 --> 01:18:12,250
Why would I do that?

1315
01:18:12,252 --> 01:18:14,620
<i>Because it's safe. Public.</i>

1316
01:18:14,622 --> 01:18:17,889
<i>And I wanna tell you what
your wife's last words were.</i>

1317
01:18:17,891 --> 01:18:20,093
<i>You have 30 minutes.</i>

1318
01:18:35,777 --> 01:18:37,279
<i>Come on, Paul.</i>

1319
01:18:39,980 --> 01:18:41,615
Paul, come on, man.

1320
01:18:42,984 --> 01:18:44,686
We gotta talk, Paul.

1321
01:18:49,524 --> 01:18:50,525
Hey, man.

1322
01:18:51,993 --> 01:18:52,994
Are you here?

1323
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:02,704
Hey, man.

1324
01:19:20,188 --> 01:19:21,456
Paul.

1325
01:20:53,914 --> 01:20:54,916
Get out.

1326
01:21:55,976 --> 01:21:57,311
Jackson.

1327
01:21:59,881 --> 01:22:01,880
- What?
- We're on our way.

1328
01:22:01,882 --> 01:22:03,648
Shooting at a club downtown.

1329
01:22:03,650 --> 01:22:05,785
Guy in a hoodie
pulled out a gun,

1330
01:22:05,787 --> 01:22:08,387
then got shot himself.
Ran out in the crowd.

1331
01:22:08,389 --> 01:22:10,488
Hey. Alert all the
local hospitals, all right?

1332
01:22:10,490 --> 01:22:12,392
Any gunshot wound
being treated,

1333
01:22:12,394 --> 01:22:14,229
a male, 40s or 50s,
give us a call!

1334
01:22:19,733 --> 01:22:21,133
<i>County reports
they have no one</i>

1335
01:22:21,135 --> 01:22:22,901
<i>matching the shooter's
description.</i>

1336
01:22:22,903 --> 01:22:25,637
<i>One of the victims
is en route to Chicago North.</i>

1337
01:22:25,639 --> 01:22:27,309
<i>He says he saw the shooter.</i>

1338
01:22:40,721 --> 01:22:42,389
The patient's this way.

1339
01:22:49,764 --> 01:22:51,729
How you doing?

1340
01:22:51,731 --> 01:22:53,366
Did you see the shooter?

1341
01:22:53,368 --> 01:22:55,735
Yeah, I did.

1342
01:22:55,737 --> 01:22:57,505
Can you describe him to us?

1343
01:23:37,311 --> 01:23:38,313
Fuck!

1344
01:24:10,478 --> 01:24:12,076
- Open it.
- Uh-huh.

1345
01:24:32,099 --> 01:24:34,032
Paul, what you gonna do?
Shoot me, too?

1346
01:24:34,034 --> 01:24:35,233
What are you doing here?

1347
01:24:35,235 --> 01:24:36,869
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

1348
01:24:36,871 --> 01:24:38,003
What is this,
your little war room?

1349
01:24:38,005 --> 01:24:39,205
Don't you judge me!

1350
01:24:39,207 --> 01:24:42,107
I'm not judging you!
I'm worried about you!

1351
01:24:42,109 --> 01:24:44,943
You... You can't do this.

1352
01:24:44,945 --> 01:24:46,512
Paul, you're not a cop.

1353
01:24:46,514 --> 01:24:49,048
Then somebody has to do it!

1354
01:24:49,050 --> 01:24:51,886
My wife and daughter
just disappear.

1355
01:24:52,820 --> 01:24:54,788
And there's no consequences.

1356
01:24:58,024 --> 01:25:00,127
I did everything
I was supposed to do.

1357
01:25:00,828 --> 01:25:02,861
Everything.

1358
01:25:02,863 --> 01:25:06,865
I worked hard.
I obeyed the law.

1359
01:25:06,867 --> 01:25:11,469
I made a life for my family.
For my wife and daughter!

1360
01:25:11,471 --> 01:25:13,237
And what?
Just forget about that?

1361
01:25:13,239 --> 01:25:15,175
They're just gone now?

1362
01:25:18,345 --> 01:25:20,345
You need to leave now, Frank.

1363
01:25:20,347 --> 01:25:22,581
I don't want you
to be part of this.

1364
01:25:22,583 --> 01:25:25,720
No. Hey, hey.
I'm already a part of this.

1365
01:25:37,164 --> 01:25:38,166
Stay, stay.

1366
01:25:45,739 --> 01:25:47,742
If it isn't Chicago's finest.

1367
01:25:48,908 --> 01:25:51,076
Hello, Frank.

1368
01:25:51,078 --> 01:25:52,777
We were expecting your brother.

1369
01:25:52,779 --> 01:25:56,714
Yeah, he's out.
Dinner party. Why, what's up?

1370
01:25:56,716 --> 01:25:59,186
Well, he could be
in real trouble.

1371
01:26:00,387 --> 01:26:03,354
Believe or not, we wanna help.

1372
01:26:03,356 --> 01:26:07,460
That's so sweet. I appreciate
your concern, Detective.

1373
01:26:07,462 --> 01:26:09,797
Like I said, when I see him,
I'll tell him.

1374
01:26:12,265 --> 01:26:13,934
That was some bullshit.

1375
01:26:15,903 --> 01:26:17,238
He's in there.

1376
01:26:19,273 --> 01:26:20,638
But we're not
arresting the surgeon

1377
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:22,476
without an ironclad proof.

1378
01:26:27,247 --> 01:26:30,081
Well, the good news is
I'm not a suspect anymore.

1379
01:26:30,083 --> 01:26:33,220
The bad news is
I'm not a suspect anymore.

1380
01:26:35,922 --> 01:26:37,425
Paul, this has to end.

1381
01:26:38,292 --> 01:26:39,592
It's gotta end, man.

1382
01:26:39,594 --> 01:26:41,425
I don't wanna have to bury
you next to your wife.

1383
01:26:41,427 --> 01:26:44,095
You're not gonna bury me.

1384
01:26:44,097 --> 01:26:45,664
All right.
We gotta figure this out

1385
01:26:45,666 --> 01:26:47,499
if you think there's
anything the cops can find.

1386
01:26:47,501 --> 01:26:49,936
There were cameras in the club.

1387
01:26:49,938 --> 01:26:51,969
I kept my head down
the whole time.

1388
01:26:51,971 --> 01:26:53,438
Where's your car?

1389
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:54,673
Near the hospital.

1390
01:26:54,675 --> 01:26:56,441
Okay, you gotta get it,

1391
01:26:56,443 --> 01:26:58,242
before the police
start checking tags.

1392
01:26:58,244 --> 01:26:59,811
Okay.

1393
01:26:59,813 --> 01:27:01,248
Who'd be calling
at 2:30 in the morning?

1394
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:03,751
Let's see.

1395
01:27:04,618 --> 01:27:05,752
It's the hospital.

1396
01:27:06,854 --> 01:27:08,021
Hello?

1397
01:27:11,291 --> 01:27:13,023
Thank you.
I'll be right there.

1398
01:27:13,025 --> 01:27:15,128
It's Jordan. She's awake.

1399
01:27:31,145 --> 01:27:32,680
Oh, baby.

1400
01:27:44,559 --> 01:27:45,726
Daddy.

1401
01:27:47,694 --> 01:27:48,996
Hi, Daddy.

1402
01:27:50,131 --> 01:27:51,132
Baby.

1403
01:27:54,335 --> 01:27:56,671
Dad, they won't tell me
where Mom is.

1404
01:28:02,143 --> 01:28:04,878
Dad, they won't
tell me where Mom is.

1405
01:28:07,148 --> 01:28:08,382
Dad, where is Mom?

1406
01:28:09,882 --> 01:28:13,820
I wanna see Mom. Where is she?
Please, Dad, where is she?

1407
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:28,236
Oh, Jesus.

1408
01:28:37,078 --> 01:28:39,512
- Hey.
- How's she doing?

1409
01:28:39,514 --> 01:28:42,446
Physically, I can take her
home in a week.

1410
01:28:42,448 --> 01:28:45,284
Mentally, she just found out
her mother died.

1411
01:28:45,286 --> 01:28:46,788
Jesus, Pauly.

1412
01:28:49,923 --> 01:28:51,223
It's a miracle though,
you know,

1413
01:28:51,225 --> 01:28:52,927
that we got her back.
It's a miracle.

1414
01:28:54,694 --> 01:28:55,928
It was a miracle.

1415
01:28:55,930 --> 01:28:57,865
All that matters
now is that...

1416
01:29:01,301 --> 01:29:02,933
You look after her.

1417
01:29:02,935 --> 01:29:04,535
Yes, of course.

1418
01:29:04,537 --> 01:29:07,371
You, though. Her father.

1419
01:29:07,373 --> 01:29:08,607
I will.

1420
01:29:08,609 --> 01:29:11,643
Not this other thing,
not this other guy. You.

1421
01:29:11,645 --> 01:29:12,714
It's over.

1422
01:29:15,649 --> 01:29:16,918
It's over.

1423
01:29:18,552 --> 01:29:19,718
Okay.

1424
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:20,885
- Slowly.
- Thanks.

1425
01:29:20,887 --> 01:29:21,954
You sure
you got everything?

1426
01:29:21,956 --> 01:29:23,054
Yeah, I got it.

1427
01:29:23,056 --> 01:29:24,121
You got her, Dad?

1428
01:29:24,123 --> 01:29:25,456
I got it, Dad. I'm okay.

1429
01:29:25,458 --> 01:29:28,393
- All right, I know you got it.
- Easy does it.

1430
01:29:28,395 --> 01:29:29,961
I can't believe
I have to leave in this,

1431
01:29:29,963 --> 01:29:31,262
I feel like an invalid.

1432
01:29:31,264 --> 01:29:32,934
You're not an invalid.

1433
01:29:34,001 --> 01:29:35,334
- Bye, Jordan.
- Bye.

1434
01:29:35,336 --> 01:29:36,771
- You ready?
- Yes, take me home.

1435
01:29:40,774 --> 01:29:42,339
- Hey, Dr. Kersey.
- Dr. Kersey.

1436
01:29:42,341 --> 01:29:45,143
- Jordan.
- Jordan.

1437
01:29:45,145 --> 01:29:48,013
I told you guys, we'll call you as
soon as she remembers something.

1438
01:29:48,015 --> 01:29:50,449
It's okay, Dad. Um...

1439
01:29:50,451 --> 01:29:52,351
I wanna help you guys,
I really do.

1440
01:29:52,353 --> 01:29:54,318
It's just that...

1441
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:57,455
I don't remember anything after
going upstairs to get the iPad.

1442
01:29:57,457 --> 01:30:00,125
Any little detail
you can remember

1443
01:30:00,127 --> 01:30:02,460
will really help us out
a lot, Jordan.

1444
01:30:02,462 --> 01:30:05,330
I don't remember a thing.
I'm sorry.

1445
01:30:05,332 --> 01:30:07,700
It's okay. Maybe over time,
you'll remember something.

1446
01:30:07,702 --> 01:30:10,434
Either way, we'll, uh, we'll
keep looking for the guys.

1447
01:30:10,436 --> 01:30:11,970
- Thank you.
- Thanks, guys.

1448
01:30:11,972 --> 01:30:13,504
- Dr. Kersey.
- We'll let you know.

1449
01:30:13,506 --> 01:30:16,040
Bye.

1450
01:30:16,042 --> 01:30:17,608
<i>Dr. Meredith,</i>

1451
01:30:17,610 --> 01:30:20,314
<i>Dr. Ronald Meredith,
please report...</i>

1452
01:30:22,948 --> 01:30:24,652
Well, they seem okay.

1453
01:30:27,354 --> 01:30:28,655
Hey, hold that.

1454
01:30:34,060 --> 01:30:35,195
Thank you.

1455
01:30:39,899 --> 01:30:42,233
What happened to you?

1456
01:30:42,235 --> 01:30:45,504
Oh, um, I was in an accident.

1457
01:30:45,506 --> 01:30:47,074
Oh, I'm sorry.

1458
01:30:48,708 --> 01:30:51,043
Are you better?

1459
01:30:51,045 --> 01:30:52,413
Yeah.

1460
01:30:55,483 --> 01:30:56,818
That's nice.

1461
01:30:59,552 --> 01:31:01,389
You going home?

1462
01:31:02,221 --> 01:31:05,192
Yeah. I'm going home.

1463
01:31:06,659 --> 01:31:09,562
I'm going home, too.

1464
01:31:09,564 --> 01:31:12,066
Well, what happened to you?

1465
01:31:12,766 --> 01:31:14,434
I got shot.

1466
01:31:17,070 --> 01:31:19,003
Oh, well...

1467
01:31:19,005 --> 01:31:21,275
I'm glad you're okay.

1468
01:31:21,942 --> 01:31:23,775
Thank you.

1469
01:31:26,546 --> 01:31:28,080
Take care.

1470
01:31:28,082 --> 01:31:30,551
I'll see you around,
Dr. Kersey.

1471
01:31:31,752 --> 01:31:33,852
Dad, who was that?

1472
01:31:33,854 --> 01:31:37,592
Not a clue, honey.
Somebody else's patient.

1473
01:31:47,268 --> 01:31:49,701
Welcome to Jolly Roger's.
How can I help you?

1474
01:31:49,703 --> 01:31:51,736
I wanna buy a gun.

1475
01:31:51,738 --> 01:31:53,607
Don't I know you?

1476
01:31:59,113 --> 01:32:00,711
Yeah, I'm taking
Writing and History.

1477
01:32:00,713 --> 01:32:03,147
Mainly just
introduction classes.

1478
01:32:03,149 --> 01:32:05,116
I'm doing it online,
just a couple hours a day.

1479
01:32:05,118 --> 01:32:06,451
So that way,
I don't fall behind

1480
01:32:06,453 --> 01:32:07,555
when school starts next fall.

1481
01:32:08,387 --> 01:32:09,657
Well, that's smart.

1482
01:32:11,658 --> 01:32:14,462
You know, I think you're
the smartest one in the family.

1483
01:32:15,328 --> 01:32:16,827
So how's your therapy coming?

1484
01:32:16,829 --> 01:32:18,964
'Cause you look like
you're getting around better.

1485
01:32:18,966 --> 01:32:21,598
It's good. You know,
boring. I'm almost done,

1486
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:23,402
but I just had to teach my body

1487
01:32:23,404 --> 01:32:25,139
how to do basic things again.

1488
01:32:26,238 --> 01:32:27,841
It feels good to have you home.

1489
01:32:28,841 --> 01:32:30,610
Feels good to be home.

1490
01:32:37,150 --> 01:32:40,186
And that's him in
the middle. Him and the girl.

1491
01:32:42,288 --> 01:32:43,754
Good night, Uncle Frank.
Love you!

1492
01:32:43,756 --> 01:32:44,925
Okay, Frankie!

1493
01:33:14,622 --> 01:33:16,891
Dad, the kitchen's clean.
I'm going to bed.

1494
01:33:19,193 --> 01:33:20,494
Okay, honey.

1495
01:33:24,197 --> 01:33:27,031
Hey, can you help me with this?

1496
01:33:27,033 --> 01:33:28,532
- Move this?
- Slide it down a little.

1497
01:33:28,534 --> 01:33:29,701
Yeah, just a little bit.
Mmm-hmm.

1498
01:33:29,703 --> 01:33:30,835
Why are you moving this?

1499
01:33:30,837 --> 01:33:33,671
Because I need you
to come over here.

1500
01:33:33,673 --> 01:33:35,305
I just saw somebody run by.

1501
01:33:35,307 --> 01:33:37,075
What do you mean you just saw
someone run by?

1502
01:33:37,077 --> 01:33:39,210
- You saw someone run by here?
- Yeah, I did. I did.

1503
01:33:39,212 --> 01:33:40,678
I want you to
get under the stairs.

1504
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:42,045
Dad, why are you putting me
under the stairs?

1505
01:33:42,047 --> 01:33:44,415
- Call the cops right now.
- Dad, please be careful.

1506
01:33:44,417 --> 01:33:46,084
- Take your phone and dial 911.
- Dad, please!

1507
01:33:51,925 --> 01:33:53,491
<i>911,
what is your emergency?</i>

1508
01:33:53,493 --> 01:33:54,826
There's men, they're
breaking into my house.

1509
01:33:54,828 --> 01:33:55,994
They're on my front lawn.

1510
01:33:55,996 --> 01:33:57,061
I think they're coming
to kill me.

1511
01:33:57,063 --> 01:33:58,196
My name is Jordan Kersey.

1512
01:33:58,198 --> 01:34:01,199
I'm at 20 Dorset Road
in Evanston.

1513
01:34:01,201 --> 01:34:02,403
I think they're here.

1514
01:35:32,359 --> 01:35:34,192
Jordan, I'm okay.

1515
01:35:34,194 --> 01:35:35,860
Dad. Dad!

1516
01:35:35,862 --> 01:35:39,697
Stay quiet.
Just wait for the police.

1517
01:35:39,699 --> 01:35:42,470
Do not come out.
Stay in there.

1518
01:36:28,347 --> 01:36:30,180
Sit down.

1519
01:36:30,182 --> 01:36:31,351
Dad?

1520
01:36:32,853 --> 01:36:34,486
I think they just shot my dad.

1521
01:36:34,488 --> 01:36:37,222
Dad! Dad!

1522
01:36:37,224 --> 01:36:39,223
Jordan, just stay up there!

1523
01:36:39,225 --> 01:36:42,227
Is that your little girl?

1524
01:36:42,229 --> 01:36:44,597
Now, you ever hear someone
burn to death?

1525
01:36:45,698 --> 01:36:47,398
You're in for a treat,
Dr. Kersey.

1526
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:48,568
Dad!

1527
01:37:15,895 --> 01:37:18,796
So you're saying
you got both the cut

1528
01:37:18,798 --> 01:37:21,398
on your hand
that's almost healed

1529
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:24,969
and the shot in the shoulder
tonight? That's your story.

1530
01:37:24,971 --> 01:37:27,705
That's what happened.
That's my story.

1531
01:37:27,707 --> 01:37:29,273
Hmm.

1532
01:37:29,275 --> 01:37:33,378
And the paperwork for
the pistols and the rifle?

1533
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:35,981
You can call Jolly Roger's
Sporting Goods.

1534
01:37:35,983 --> 01:37:37,449
Ask for Bethany.

1535
01:37:37,451 --> 01:37:40,818
And you bought these guns...

1536
01:37:40,820 --> 01:37:43,987
The day my daughter came home.

1537
01:37:43,989 --> 01:37:47,161
Just in case something like
this ever happened again.

1538
01:37:48,295 --> 01:37:50,661
What about a Glock?

1539
01:37:50,663 --> 01:37:55,068
I had one for a while.
Decided to get rid of it.

1540
01:37:56,235 --> 01:37:57,637
Gone for good?

1541
01:37:58,939 --> 01:38:01,008
Yeah. Gone for good.

1542
01:38:03,409 --> 01:38:06,110
Well, I got everything I need.

1543
01:38:06,112 --> 01:38:08,513
Seems pretty straightforward.
Knox came back,

1544
01:38:08,515 --> 01:38:10,781
'cause he thought
Jordan could ID him.

1545
01:38:10,783 --> 01:38:13,487
And you defended your family
like any man would.

1546
01:38:14,020 --> 01:38:15,289
Thank you.

1547
01:38:17,291 --> 01:38:20,424
And Dr. Kersey,
stick to saving lives.

1548
01:38:20,426 --> 01:38:21,793
You're good at it.

1549
01:38:21,795 --> 01:38:22,960
I will.

1550
01:38:22,962 --> 01:38:24,298
Thanks for everything.

1551
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:44,350
So, you satisfied?

1552
01:38:45,185 --> 01:38:46,620
No.

1553
01:38:52,792 --> 01:38:54,862
Now I'm satisfied.

1554
01:39:10,511 --> 01:39:11,576
Sway in the Morning,

1555
01:39:11,578 --> 01:39:13,009
<i>Shade 45 at Sirius XM.</i>

1556
01:39:13,011 --> 01:39:14,312
<i>Hey, Grim Reaper,</i>

1557
01:39:14,314 --> 01:39:15,647
<i>we don't know where you
are, where you went,</i>

1558
01:39:15,649 --> 01:39:16,848
<i>or what happened to you,</i>

1559
01:39:16,850 --> 01:39:19,153
<i>whoever that is,
stay there. Peace.</i>

1560
01:39:21,721 --> 01:39:23,787
Have I told you
how proud I am of you?

1561
01:39:23,789 --> 01:39:26,958
Yes, Dad, you've told me,
like, a billion times.

1562
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:29,561
If you ever need anything,
I'm just three stops away.

1563
01:39:29,563 --> 01:39:32,099
I know, Dad.
I've got the number.

1564
01:39:34,266 --> 01:39:35,733
I love you.

1565
01:39:35,735 --> 01:39:37,003
I love you, honey.

1566
01:39:40,573 --> 01:39:43,174
Well, you can go now.

1567
01:39:43,176 --> 01:39:45,612
All right. Go be smart.

1568
01:39:49,515 --> 01:39:50,516
Bye, baby.

1569
01:40:05,998 --> 01:40:07,001
Hey!
