<i> One of the sergeants stated</i>

312
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,810
<i> that he was dispatched</i>
<i> to this location</i>

313
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,310
<i> to assist</i>
<i> Child Protective Service</i>

314
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,410
<i> and remove</i>
<i> two or three children</i>

315
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:05,880
<i> who had not been</i>
<i> attending school.</i>

316
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:09,020
<i> Upon walking in,</i>
<i> he saw several crucifixes,</i>

317
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:12,390
<i> candles which had been burnt,</i>
<i> and Bibles.</i>

318
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,450
And he stated
that he had an eerie feeling

319
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,490
within inside the residence.

320
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:18,890
<i> In my 37 years</i>
<i> of police investigation,</i>

321
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:21,660
<i> I've never run into anything</i>
<i> like that before.</i>

322
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,900
<i> [zapping sound effects]</i>

323
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:29,170
<i> So we stayed up here</i>
<i> for approximately 45 minutes,</i>

324
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,770
<i> and I was in disbelief.</i>

325
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:34,910
- What time do the things
in this usually start?

326
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,210
You said in the evening?

327
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,640
- They don't have
a special time.

328
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,250
-<i> So I'm saying,</i>
<i> yeah, okay, right.</i>

329
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,750
<i> This is really occurring.</i>

330
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,950
-<i> The officers then</i>
<i> went down into the basement.</i>

331
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,260
-<i> And it was a table</i>

332
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,590
<i> with a crucifix, a Bible,</i>

333
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,830
<i> and a candle</i>
<i> which had been lit.</i>

334
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,100
We stayed down here
for about 15 minutes.

335
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,270
<i> And he was videotaping.</i>

336
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,800
<i> I was taking my iPhone</i>

337
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,600
<i> and I was taking pictures</i>
<i> and whatever.</i>

338
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,040
And I said,
"It's time for me to leave.

339
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:08,310
I've had enough."

340
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,240
<i> I immediately started walking.</i>

341
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,880
And as I walked, I say...

342
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,650
"That's weird."

343
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,420
I don't know that much
about construction.

344
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:21,690
But why would somebody concrete
a whole basement

345
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,160
and leave dirt
under the stairs?

346
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,130
I said,
"That don't make sense."

347
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,630
And as I look closer,

348
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:31,530
<i> I saw floor pan</i>
<i> with a candle on it.</i>

349
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,670
Don't make sense.

350
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,000
Don't make common sense.

351
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,440
-<i> At this stage</i>
<i> of the police investigation,</i>

352
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,140
<i> what Captain Austin</i>
<i> perceives as odd</i>

353
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:44,410
<i> may be something much graver.</i>

354
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:49,220
<i> Is it possible this discovery</i>
<i> is the remnants of a ritual,</i>

355
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:53,450
<i> one capable of conjuring</i>
<i> something terrifying?</i>

356
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:02,530
- Then, in fact,
things start occurring.

357
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,200
- What do you mean things?

358
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,400
What kind of things?

359
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:08,800
<i> [eerie creaking]</i>

360
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,600
- We noticed when
we went in the basement,

361
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,240
there's actually two doors.

362
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,910
<i> The one on the left that</i>
<i> actually goes to the room,</i>

363

at various times
we were in the basement,

364
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,180
it was in a different position,

365
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:20,950
and neither one of us
had went into the room.

366
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,920
- I had an audio recording

367
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,790
that I was walking
around the house,

368
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:30,920
<i> just making notes</i>
<i> or commenting on things.</i>

369
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:35,830
<i> There was an unusual,</i>
<i> unidentifiable voice</i>

370
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,760
<i> that appeared on that audio.</i>

371
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,570
<i> They're burning stuff</i>
<i> all over the place here.</i>

372
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,000

<i> [indistinct</i>
<i> background chatter]</i>

374
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,180
-<i> I'm surprised</i>
<i> the fire department</i>

375
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,680
<i> hasn't been here.</i>

376
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,480
It sounds like "heys" to me.

377
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,750
<i> [indistinct whooshing]</i>

<i> [indistinct whooshing]</i>

382
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,650
-<i> Did you hear that</i>
<i> with your own ears?</i>

383
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:00,790
- When that happened that day,

384
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,320
I did not hear any voice.

385
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,860
I only heard it
on the recording.

386
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:08,200
<i> [indistinct whooshing]</i>

387
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,000
- And I walked out of here

388
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,830
and got in my unit,
squad car,

389
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:15,200
<i> and I drove approximately</i>
<i> a mile and a half away.</i>

390

- You pulled over, no?

391
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,340
- Right, I'm in
a gas station parking lot.

392
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,140
And all of a sudden,

393
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:29,650
<i> the AM/FM radio in my car</i>
<i> changed and went to static.</i>

394
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,820
And it said,
"Who in there?"

395
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,720
<i> [crickets chirping]</i>

396
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,190
-<i> The home's previous owner</i>
<i> told me</i>

397
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,660
<i> that other police officers</i>

398
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,260
<i> had experienced things</i>
<i> in the house</i>

399
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,800
<i> that had caused them</i>
<i> to quit their jobs</i>

400
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,900
<i> and move away from the area.</i>

401
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,470
- I have come
to the conclusion,

402
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,510
because of everything
that had transpired

403
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,340
and all the things
that I had witnessed

404
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,710
and heard about,

405
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:00,480
that it affected women
and children physically

406
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,680
and the stronger men
electronically.

407
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,950
We set up another meeting
to come to this house.

408
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:07,790
- Who did?

409
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,590
- Myself, the other officers,

410
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,120
Child Protective Services.

411
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,390
-<i> The same CPS worker</i>
<i> from before?</i>

412
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,230
- No, she wouldn't come back.

413
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,300
- Why?

414
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:17,960
- She was terrified.

415
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,740
<i> Something was coming</i>
<i> from underneath those stairs</i>

416
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:27,540
that was causing
the whole house...

417
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,410
To turn.

418
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:33,710
<i> [eerie music]</i>

419
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,590
-<i> In light</i>
<i> of these developments,</i>

420
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,290
<i> Reverend Maginot gets approval</i>

421
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,030
<i> to perform a minor rite</i>
<i> on the mother, Latoya Ammons.</i>

422
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:48,800
-<i> You basically want to try</i>
<i> to either aggravate the demon</i>

423
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,800
<i> or abate it.</i>

424
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,570
But if it's consistent,

425
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,000
okay, you're not really
affecting the demon,

426
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,070
and you may be
endangering the person.

427
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:00,670
<i> Behold the cross of the Lord.</i>

428
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,740
<i> Flee bands of enemies.</i>

429
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,180
<i> May you be snatched away</i>

430
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,580
<i> and driven</i>
<i> from the church of God</i>

431
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,150
<i> and from the souls redeemed</i>

432
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:12,250
<i> by the precious blood</i>
<i> of the Divine Lamb.</i>

433
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:14,820
<i> I saw she had an aversion</i>
<i> to holy objects.</i>

434
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,320
I put the crucifix on her head.

435
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,560
She began convulsing.

436
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,960
I took it off;
she stopped convulsing.

437
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,590
<i> And then I did it</i>
<i> a second time.</i>

438
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,760
<i> Again, watching,</i>
<i> it's consistent.</i>

439
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,270
And did it a third time.

440
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,800
- Father Maginot sat
on the couch with a Bible,

441
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,900
<i> some holy water,</i>
<i> and some salt.</i>

442
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,470
And he was reading the Bible.

443
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,670
He was just intense.

444
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,940
He was really reading.

445
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,880
-<i> While Reverend Maginot</i>
<i> tends to Latoya,</i>

446
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:41,050
<i> the three police officers</i>
<i> who are present</i>

447
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:46,820
<i> begin digging in the basement,</i>
<i> under the stairs.</i>

448
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,420
-<i> We were digging, whatever.</i>

449
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,420
<i> He had dug about 4 feet.</i>

450
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,460
-<i> The officer?</i>

451
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:54,230
-<i> Right.</i>

452
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,530
<i> And he found a nail,</i>

453
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,100
<i> a finger nail, a clip-on nail.</i>

454
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:59,030
I think it was pink in color.

455
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,200
- A nail?

456
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,300
- Right, right,
a finger nail, a clip-on nail.

457
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,640
And he found some panties.

458
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,240
- Panties?

459
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:09,610
-<i> Women's panties,</i>
<i> women's underwear.</i>

460
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,440
-<i> Also dug up that day:</i>

461
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:17,220
<i> a comb, two children's socks,</i>
<i> a heavy bar, and a red tin.</i>

462
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:21,050
<i> So who buried these objects</i>
<i> under the stairs?</i>

463
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,990
<i> And why?</i>

464
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,230
Do you believe that
that house was haunted

465
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,200
before Latoya and her family
moved in?

466
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:35,400
- If those items were there
from that original family,

467
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,740
it could be.

468
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:38,040
Now, I think it would be

469
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,840
what you would call
"necromancy,"

470
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:44,180
which is trying to communicate
with the dead.

471

- We only assumed,
because we had no expertise,

472
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:50,950
that this was a portal to Hell.

473
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:53,950
-<i> Upstairs,</i>
<i> something begins to happen</i>

474
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,590
<i> in the center bedroom.</i>

475
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,790
- We went in the center bedroom
on the first floor,

476
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:01,490
and the blinds
were dripping oil.

477
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,230
In fact, they weren't dripping
from the top,

478
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,560
as you would expect.

479
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,300
They were dripping
from the middle of the blinds.

480
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,340
-<i> There was</i>
<i> some liquid material</i>

481
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:13,340
<i> that had appeared</i>
<i> on some blinds in there,</i>

482
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:15,840
and we had no source
for that material.

483
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,540
-<i> We left the room.</i>

484
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,380
<i> First, we photographed it</i>
<i> and documented it.</i>

485
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,580
<i> And then I wiped down</i>
<i> the blinds.</i>

486
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,980
<i> And then we sealed the room,</i>

487
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,090
<i> and I thought,</i>
<i> if the grandmother</i>

488
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,360
<i> had went in there</i>
<i> and introduced the oil,</i>

489
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:32,790
I wanted to make sure that she
didn't go in the second time.

490
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,190
<i> So we stuck a Q-tip</i>
<i> in the door,</i>

491
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,960
<i> at the bottom of the door,</i>

492
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,530
<i> and then we came back</i>
<i> about 40 minutes later,</i>

493
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:39,200
<i> after Father Maginot</i>
<i> had blessed the house.</i>

494
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,900
<i> And the Q-tip</i>
<i> was still in the door.</i>

495
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,140
We went in, and the blinds
were dripping oil again.

496
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,100
<i> Lieutenant Gruszka</i>
<i> went outside,</i>

497
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,770
<i> and we shined flashlights</i>
<i> on the outside of the window</i>

498
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:49,240
<i> to see if it was coming in</i>

499
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,980
<i> from the outside</i>
<i> or from the ceiling,</i>

500
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:54,110
and we could never determine
the source of that.

501
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,990
-<i> This CPS worker would be</i>
<i> the next to fall victim</i>

502
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,960
<i> to the malevolent energy</i>
<i> in this home.</i>

503
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:05,090
-<i> The CPS opened the cabinet,</i>

504
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:07,060
and she took her left hand,
I remember.

505
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,530
She may be left-handed.

506
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,160
And she touched the dripping.

507
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,900
-<i> The fluid...</i>
<i> - The fluid.</i>

508
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:13,770
-<i> That you'd been seeing.</i>
<i> - Right, right.</i>

509
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,270
- And when she touched
the fluid,

510
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,370
a whole half of her hand
changed

511
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,510
like all the blood
had been drawn out of it.

512
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,570
- It went white?

513
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:21,740
- White.

514
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,580
<i> It was just completely white.</i>

515
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:27,250
And she had to leave the house.

516
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,650
- She had complained
of pain in that,

517
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,190
and it did turn white.

518
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,950
- I went on the investigation,
like I said,

519
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:36,920
at the very beginning,
thinking that it was a hoax.

520
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,460
The more investigation we did,

521
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:41,060
I believe
that there's something there.

522
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,660
There's just too many people

523
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,400
that I know
are truthful people

524
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:49,040
that saw things,
some of them which I saw,

525
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,700
to discount everything.

526
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:54,040
- I was talking to the Child
Protective Services worker.

527
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,440
Her hand was starting
to come back to life.

528
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,110
- Okay.

529
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:03,280
- And Father Maginot came to
the front porch stairs outside,

530
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,520
and he stood there,
and he looked.

531
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,450
I say, "Father, what's wrong?"

532
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:12,760
And he looked exactly
like the CPS worker's hand.

533
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:15,860
He was flush
as a sheet of paper.

534
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,660
And it was like...

and she was just
snapping off.

1092
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,360
- Look down in pity on this,

1093
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:54,460
your servant Erica,

1094
00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:57,830
now in the toils
of the unclean spirit,

1095
00:51:57,860 --> 00:52:00,330
now caught up
in the fearsome threats

1096
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:02,470
of man's ancient enemy,

1097
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,540
sworn full of our race.

1098
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:05,940
-<i> Another weird thing</i>

1099
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:08,240
that happened when
we was at the hospital--

1100
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:11,910
and I'm not making this up,
on everything I love--

1101
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:14,410
my daughter was laying
in the bed.

1102
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:15,880
And where Erica got up,

1103
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,350
there was a "6," like,
engraved in her back.

1104
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:20,520
So my daughter was like...

1105
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:21,750
- Wait, what?

1106
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:22,920
- A "6," like a number "6."

1107
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,360
- Was engraved in whose back?

1108
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:25,920
- It was in Erica's back.

1109
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:29,290
"Mommy, Mommy, Erica got
a 6 on her back."

1110
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:31,200
- Do you remember
seeing this 6

1111
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:32,560
that was carved in her back?

1112
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,830
- Yeah.

1113
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:36,570
She was being all calm
and weird.

1114
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,270
- How was she being weird?

1115
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:39,840
- Because it wasn't her.

1116
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:41,840
Like it was somebody else
in her stomach or something.

1117
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:45,310
- Do you know how this 6
got carved in her?

1118
00:52:45,350 --> 00:52:46,310
- Mm-mm.

1119
00:52:46,350 --> 00:52:50,980
- It was a number six.

1120
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:52,250
-<i> Let us pray.</i>

1121
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:55,320
God, creator and defender
of the human race,

1122
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:58,190
Who made man
in your own image,

1123
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:02,090
Look down in pity on this,
your servant Erica...

1124
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:05,330
[echoing] now in the toils
of the unclean spirit...

1125
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:08,700
<i> So it seemed like that</i>
<i> might have been the moment.</i>

1126
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:09,870
-<i> Of what?</i>

1127
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:11,740
- The moment
that it might have...

1128
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:13,400
- Left her?
- Left her.

1129
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,040
- So it seemed like it...
you know...

1130
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,810
So I don't know
if that's what she does.

1131
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,840
She doesn't remember that.

- Yes.
- Yes.

1189

So we'll see what happens.

1197
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:47,750
I want to talk to him

1198
00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:49,090
if he had anything to do

1199
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:52,520
with putting a curse
on that family.

1200
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:53,830
Even if he won't tell me,

1201
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:55,930
I can still just get
a good sense

1202

of his personality.

1203
00:56:58,730 --> 00:57:00,900
I'll get a sense of his energy,

1204
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:03,470
to see if he would be
the type of person

1205
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:06,470
that would be into the occult.

1206

Are these natural
