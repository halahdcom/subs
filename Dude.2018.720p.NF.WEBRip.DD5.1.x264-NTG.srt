First prom with my dudes.

It's hot. I need something to drink.

36
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,554
- Hello.
- Hello.

37
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:28,606
Making you thirsty?

38
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,607
- Yeah.
- Okay.

39
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,691
- Having fun?
- Yeah, I'm having fun.

40
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:42,036
- The fields, field of dreams.
- Yup.

41
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,413
And that's home base.

42
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,082
- Did I get that right?
- No, that's the pitcher's...

43
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,810
- That's the pitcher's mound.
- You don't have an idea.

44
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,960
There is home base.

45
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:51,504
- And that's where you stand?
- Yeah, yeah.

46
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,468
Where all your dreams came true.

47
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,550
Yeah.

48
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,932
Are you sad about graduating?

49
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,352
Not really. Are you?

50
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,730
Chloe and I are gonna come visit you...

51
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,689
obviously.

52
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,153
I'm just glad I have another year here.

53
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,448
I can't imagine leaving this place.

54
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:23,244
I think if you do it right,
it never really leaves you.

55
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,540
Sorry, I just heard that
and threw up in my own mouth.

56
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:32,712
I hope you're right.

57
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:41,971
Hey! Come on. Limo's here.
Let's get some double-doubles.

58
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,140
Okay. Be right there.

59
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,196
Oh, my God,
I got so wasted last night.

60
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,240
So, wait, what happened?

61
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:03,117
The bouncer wouldn't let you in
with your In-N-Out.

62
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,173
Which was obviously unacceptable.

63
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,456
Right. So, that's when we hoisted
you over the wall of the patio.

64
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,466
And then,
you fall into the cactus.

65
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,120
Oh, dude. They're everywhere.

66
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,464
It's like I was giving blowies
in the desert all night.

67
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,717
Oh, fuck. I have work tomorrow.

68
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,886
Yeah, I have a practice exam
in the morning.

69
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,345
All right.

70
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,807
- Bye, ladies.
- Bye.

71
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,725
- I love you.
- Bye.

72
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,227
Bye.

73
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,204
Okay. To the homestead?

74
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,453
Thomas wants us to come
to Top of the World.

75
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,446
- Cool.
- Okay, okay, okay.

76
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,699
Would you rather
lose all the hair on your body

77
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,492
or be a prostitute for a week?

78
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,161
- Prostitute for a week.
- Easily.

79
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,163
You didn't even hear the parameters.

80
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,083
No hair whatsoever,
no eyebrows, no lashes.

81
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,502
Oh, please. Come on.
I pay good money to have hot wax

82
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:55,938
rip most of that shit
out of my body anyway.

83
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:59,299
Yeah, for real.
But seriously, feel how smooth.

84
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,259
Is it good?

85
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,678
It might be cool
to be all slithery like a dolphin.

86
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:09,475
I don't think I'd do well as a prostitute.
I'd definitely end up a truck-stop boy.

87
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,228
I'd be an escort, but I'd only take jobs
from Johns who, like,

88
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,022
- wanted to be dominated and stuff.
- Yeah.

89
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,025
You guys have always sucked at this.

90
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:20,320
Whatever. Your go-to used to be
fart out of your mouth or sweat piss?

91
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,197
Still a valid question.
You lack imagination.

92
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:28,369
Can't believe school's in your hands now.
It's all downhill.

93
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,905
Every year says that.

94
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,207
And this bitch will be president
and these things will be extra special.

95
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,859
All right. Come on.
I'm tired as balls. Let's get out of here.

96
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,632
Thomas, I told mom
we'd be home soon.

97
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,760
Xi'an dinner tomorrow night?

98
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,220
- Oh, definitely.
- Okay.

99
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,639
We got to hit all the usual spots
before you go.

100
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,811
Okay. Bye, Thomas.
See you at home.

101
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,189
Don't be too long. Mom's gonna be pissed.

102
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,068
Love you.

103
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:03,821
Love you, girls.

104
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,553
<i>Today we mark a moment
we will never understand,</i>

105
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,431
<i>that life stops.</i>

106
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:34,102
<i>A son, a brother,</i>

107
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:38,606
<i>a friend was taken from us.</i>

108
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:41,543
<i>I've tried to take comfort in the fact</i>

109
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,569
<i>that we are now
the stewards of his story...</i>

110
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,114
<i>...of his joy,</i>

111
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,282
<i>of his life.</i>

112
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,370
<i>We must hold on to that and to each other.</i>

113
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:07,343
Oh, my God. Chloe,
we're so sorry. He meant so much to us.

114
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:10,263
No. Not right now. No.

115
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,277
<i>What other way is there to heal
the pain than to think of him and cry,</i>

116
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:30,116
<i>and laugh, and be together?</i>

117
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,179
Mint?

118
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:56,767
I'm gonna chug it.

119
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,773
Oh! My eyes.

120
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:08,112
Oh shit. You guys, we're late for yoga.

121
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,864
Namast-gay.

122
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:13,576
Oh. I got to meet with Student Council
Noah about prom.

123
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,299
You, you have your college meeting, yeah?

124
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,746
Oh, yeah. I should roll.

125
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,748
- Love you.
- Love you, bye.

126
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,561
Okay. So it's all finished?

127
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:23,961
- Pretty much.
- Okay. Great.

128
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:27,256
Are you sure you want to shut down
a full road for a red carpet?

129
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:31,844
Yes. Big gestures are very important.
Okay. So, what I'm thinking...

130
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,054
Hey, Lil.

131
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,348
Top of the afternoon, Guy.

132
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,559
Aren't you supposed to be
in my class right now?

133
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,395
Aren't you supposed to be
in your class right now?

134
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,149
- This never happened.
- What never happened?

135
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:47,860
Here you go.

136
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,321
Okay. I'm super excited.
I'm gonna plaster these around.

137
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:51,989
I'm thinking bathroom stalls.

138
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,273
Because people taking shits
are a very captive audience.

139
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,160
Ooh. Yeah. I like the way you move.

140
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,162
- Yeah. Bye.
- Bye.

141
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,171
- Hey.
- Hey.

142
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,506
How'd it go?

143
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,925
Uh, waitlist. Should find out this week.

144
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:13,844
She just keeps telling me
to think positive thoughts.

145
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:17,431
Sometimes I just wanna punch her
in her third eye.

146
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:21,727
I guess if I don't get in,
Santa Barbara wouldn't be that bad.

147
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,021
No. Hm-mmm.

148
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,357
You're going to NYU
and I'm going to Columbia.

149
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,109
We're gonna be life partners forever.

150
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,487
God, imagine how many times
we've walked these halls and thought

151
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,699
three months, two months, two weeks.

152
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,243
How the fuck did we get here?

153
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,539
"Time has a terrible way of fleeting by."

154
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,584
My mom wrote that to me
in a letter when I was eight.

155
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,460
Okay. I got to dump out.

156
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,402
I can't believe
you like shitting at school.

157
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,719
I'm very comfortable here.

158
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:56,804
So...

159
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,389
- Yo! What's up?
- Hey.

160
00:09:58,472 --> 00:09:59,908
Just the girl I was looking for.

161
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,475
- Oh, Sam.
- Jared.

162
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,269
Jared. Hey guys, what's up?

163
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:08,149
So, we got a create-a-party tomorrow
at Carrie's and I need to spread the word.

164
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,360
- Hold on.
- Uh-oh.

165
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,154
I know what this is.

166
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:14,904
Hi, guys.

167
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:20,578
Hi. So, it was a really good day
at Path Less Taken, wasn't it?

168
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,621
Yeah, this guy knows
what I'm talking about. Cool.

169
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,957
Okay. So we only have
two weeks left, right?

170
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,921
- We need to cherish...
- And so, at prom, you two going together?

171
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:31,047
Well, yeah. <i>Mein Fuhrer</i> 's orders.

172
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,258
Yeah, she used to pencil in our playdates.

173
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:37,637
Prom, May 18th, it's gonna be
the best night of your life.

174
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,531
- But it's a shame though.
- I promise you.

175
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,635
- Buy tickets, please.
- I look fine in a tux.

176
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:45,144
Please, please.
Also, party at Carrie's tomorrow night.

177
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,896
Yes, thank you.

178
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,774
- Bye.
- Here you go.

179
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,319
Hey.

180
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:54,820
- Yo.
- Yo.

181
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,865
- Pretty good, huh?
- Mmm, that was nice.

182
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:00,117
- Bemis alarm. 3:00.
- Oh. Ooh,

183
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,244
Bemis.

184
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,372
Bite my penis.

185
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:09,117
- Bemis is really hot.
- I know, right?

186
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,503
I like his wizard glasses.

187
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,089
Yeah, I'd let him Harry Potter this.

188
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,514
You should hide Donkey Bong better.

189
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:25,351
Come on. We need him around.
His last days of high school, too.

190
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,704
So we'll pick up tree
then meet at my house, yeah?

191
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:28,771
- For sure.
- Okay. Bye.

192
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,192
Becks.

193
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:35,693
Beck.

194
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,197
Rebecca, come on.

195
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:40,824
Becks.

00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,011
Hello? Yeah, father.

205
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,806
Divorce meeting tomorrow, remember?

206
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,851
Why don't you call her?

207
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,435
Bye.

208
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,138
Are you f...

209
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,564
Hey, don't text and drive.

210
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:16,527
From Dad, "Your mother is a bitch."

211
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,946
Is everything okay?

212
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:24,910
Do you ever feel like your parents only
see you as an extension of their own ego

213
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,830
and have no regard
for your personal happiness

214
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,290
as an autonomous human being?

215
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,727
Yes. And they just don't know how to
support you in the ways that you need,

216
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:35,171
and that makes you feel alienated,
and then you feel guilty

217
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,773
for feeling alienated,
and then you resent them

218
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,900
for making you feel guilty
for feeling alienated, but the truth is

219
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,677
they just don't have the capacity
to understand or care?

220
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,305
Yeah. Hold on.

221
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,807
What were you and Bemis talking about?

222
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:51,645
Ugh. So, I gave a great presentation
on Kant today,

223
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:55,483
and then found this in my locker.

224
00:12:56,567 --> 00:13:00,779
"I KANT stand this KUNT."
That's actually pretty clever.

225
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,657
Well, fuck you, because Bemis

226
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:07,453
said that my unpacking
of the third formulation was enlightened.

227
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:11,665
Mmm. Are you sure he wasn't talking
about the unpacking of his cock?

228
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,751
That... Ten and two.

229
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,669
Jesus.

230
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:18,881
Who goes there? What up?

231
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,966
- What up?
- Okay, okay. I knew it was you.

232
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,011
Thank you for putting up
my draconian security protocol.

233
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,327
How y'all doing? Have a seat.

234
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,308
Uh, I laid out
a little sample sale here.

235
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:33,145
We got Pluto OG,
aka Neil deGrasse Tyson.

236
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:37,149
Next up we got one I call Kramer,
because it like pops in.

237
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,010
You know I'm saying?
And then we got Strawberry Cough

238
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,877
and Barack O'bubba Kush,
because I know you're political and shit.

239
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,615
- Ha!
- Get some Cough.

240
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,518
That was your bro's favorite, too.

241
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,748
Highs and lows?

242
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:56,418
I'll go first. Highs,

243
00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:00,506
prom-planning, duh. Uhm, and lows,

244
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,927
hmm, only having two weeks left
of high school with you guys.

245
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,971
That was so sad, it sucks.

246
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,366
Becks' eye-fucked Bemis
for, like, 30 full seconds.

247
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:13,852
Oh, yeah, I did, because Amelia,
in yoga, was pose banging Aaron Jakes'

248
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:14,979
like cat and cow.

249
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,982
How about this? You like that one?
You like this one?

250
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,359
How's my pussy looking downward dog?

251
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,288
Oh, look at that.
What's that one?

252
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,280
How's that back arch
for my vagina?

253
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,574
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Aaron Jakes,

254
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,535
the, the sophomore
who wears that puka shell necklace?

255
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,912
- Have his balls even dropped yet?
- Yes.

256
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:33,873
Into your mouth?

257
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,625
A couple times. He could be fun for prom.

258
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:42,047
Have you guys given thought
to going to prom together?

259
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,174
Just girls?

260
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,052
Oh, I want a real prom date,
like with a penis.

261
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:50,514
I know. There will be plenty of guys
to satisfy us at After Prom.

262
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,224
Okay. Sorry, Slutty B. Anthony.

263
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,977
But this is about more than just
girl power and getting laid.

264
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,396
Ugh, fine, you guys are such girls.

265
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,371
You should invite Bemis to prom.

266
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,734
I might invite him
to the graduation party.

267
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,402
- Ooh.
- Hi, guys.

268
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,112
- Hi, Jill.
- Hi.

269
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,947
Jill, who did you take to prom?

270
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:11,035
Uhm, I went with, uh, Lily's dad.

271
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:16,165
So, look how well that turned out.
Just kidding.

272
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,542
- Little girls.
- Love you.

273
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,628
Not so little anymore.

274
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,667
Now they're just a bunch
of washed-up skanks.

275
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,132
- What the fuck? Shut up.
- Whoa.

276
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,776
- Excuse me.
- They washed-up, they swag.

277
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,986
- They all washed-up.
- Fuck you.

278
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,030
- It's over.
- Crap, I got to pick up your sister.

279
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,374
I need some perfume. You got any?

280
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,724
Mom, she, she knows that you smoke.

281
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:39,021
When you have kids,
you will know how important it is

282
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:42,107
to keep up appearances for your children,

283
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:46,195
and then slowly reveal all your flaws
when they're old enough to handle them.

284
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:47,528
Okay, bye.

285
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,507
- I love you girls so much.
- Love you.

286
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:50,532
Love you.

287
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:53,786
I can't wait to be a mother.

288
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,581
- Go away. Get out of here.
- So weird. Go away.

289
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,710
- How's everybody doing?
- Excited.

290
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,671
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Uhm,

291
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,507
Chloe hasn't heard from NYU yet,
so that's a bummer.

292
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:09,468
Yeah, but I mean, wasn't she feeling
really good about UCSB?

293
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:14,014
No. Us, going to school together,
near each other, that is part of the plan.

294
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,476
Okay, my little cruise director.

295
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,228
- It is.
- Okay.

296
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,690
- Sorry.
- Okay. Okay.

297
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,860
- What's this? What are you writing?
- Oh. No, that's, uh...

298
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,029
it's for Clo.

299
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:34,952
Tomorrow's Thomas' 19th birthday.
So, I just had some nice things planned.

300
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,164
Do you wanna talk about it?

301
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:41,583
I'm fine.

302
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:46,088
It's gonna be a tough day, for everybody.

303
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,814
You know,
he would have hated this shrine.

304
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:33,112
"Don't be such a sad sack, mom. Turn it
into a pool room or a sex dungeon."

305
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,490
Hmm.

306
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,202
It's not
how it's supposed to be.

307
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,205
I know.

308
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,874
But it's how it is, mom.

309
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,885
We, we could do something later, maybe.

310
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,931
Yeah. Yeah.

311
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,696
Top of the morning, Jerry.
You wanted to see me?

312
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,324
So, how you doing?

313
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,409
Great.

314
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,245
A little wound-up lately?

315
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,248
Uh, it's kind of my default.

316
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:30,919
Okay. So, I wanted to talk to you about
some prom stuff before Student Council.

317
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,547
I wanna talk to you about delegating.

318
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,426
- You suck at it.
- Don't do this to me, Jerry. Don't do it.

319
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:40,220
You know who...
- And just because it hasn't worked before,

320
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,514
doesn't mean it never will.

321
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:48,275
People can be there, if you let them. You have to share
this process, you have to share it with Student Council,

322
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:52,498
especially with Noah, because
it looks like he's gonna be the one

323
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,650
taking over next year.

324
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:58,530
Okay. A wise man once told me, "The world
begins when I'm born and ends when I die."

325
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:02,075
And I really feel that that applies
to my tenure here. So, let's just,

326
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,578
you know, let that one marinate
and then we can circle back.

327
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,290
That doesn't make any sense.

328
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:14,804
My buddy was in jail at San Quentin. He was jonesing for some blow.
Uh, those days I had a pretty good arm. So, I loaded up a tennis ball

329
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:25,224
with some grade A quality snow,
hurled it over the wall.

330
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:26,975
It worked out great.

331
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:31,355
Okay. Let's get started
with those drug presentations.

332
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:34,316
- PCP?
- I have to go to the bathroom.

333
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:38,487
- Uhm, can it wait?
- If you want a bloody beanbag.

334
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:46,328
Menstruation is a miracle. I'm jealous
that I can't experience it myself.

335
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,414
Take your time.

336
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:55,337
All right. Who's ready? Angel dust?

337
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,329
<i>Hey, Clo, you still at Lil's?</i>

338
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,791
<i>I'm, uh, I'm gonna swing by
and get you girls in 30.</i>

339
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,127
<i>I love you.
I'll call you when I'm outside.</i>

340
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,720
<i>Hey, Clo, you still at Lil's?</i>

341
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,223
<i>I'm, uh, I'm gonna swing by
and get you girls in 30.</i>

342
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,642
<i>I love you.
I'll call you when I'm outside.</i>

343
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,896
<i>Hey, Clo, you still at Lil's?</i>

344
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:58,608
<i>I'm, uh, I'm gonna swing by
and get you girls in 30.</i>

345
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,236
<i>I love you.
I'll call you when I'm outside.</i>

346
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,543
Clo. Clo.

347
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,921
- Hey.
- Hey. I took the liberty.

348
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,216
- Is class over?
- Yeah.

349
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,304
- Thank you.
- No problem.

350
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:37,354
It was a hard day.

351
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:41,692
Here.

352
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,323
To Thomas,

353
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,744
who showed us that

354
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,790
you can be smart,

355
00:22:56,166 --> 00:23:00,629
athletic, kind, and...

356
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:04,216
fucking high all at the same time.

357
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:06,885
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

358
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,231
You want me to get Lil?

359
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:24,486
No, it's okay. She's off saving the world,
one prom at a time.

360
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,363
Yeah.

361
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:33,078
Well, you know, uhm, speaking of prom...

362
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:35,287
Uhm...

363
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,168
I was a little worried that

364
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:43,713
you might think I was just, like,
fucking around earlier.

365
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:50,428
Definitely. I'd really like to go
with you, if you're into it?

366
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,284
I don't know about your face.
I don't know if you would. But...

367
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,850
No, I have this, uhm...

368
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,938
I have this pre-frosh thing
at UCSB this weekend.

369
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,106
-No. That's, that's chill.

370
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,917
- I totally get that.
- No. No. No. No. I'm not saying that.

371
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:07,070
I don't, I don't know
if I'm gonna go to that or not, uhm,

372
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,282
but if I don't go,
I'd love to go to prom with you.

373
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,868
Well you should then. Cool.

374
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:16,705
<i>So Jerry will make</i>

375
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:19,666
an announcement
and then it'll be girls' soccer,

376
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:20,876
led by yours truly.

377
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:25,213
Then it'll be boys' soccer,
though I really object to that order,

378
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,924
but then we'll both celebrate
our crushing victories.

379
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,759
Okay. Prom?

380
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:39,019
I really need your guys' help on this.
So Noah...

381
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:42,105
will you check the rates
at these catering companies?

382
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:47,319
Uhm, try Alphonso at Café Food,
just let me know if you need any help.

383
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,842
You know what, I can actually, I can...

384
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:56,745
Noah, uh, are there some
agenda issues you'd like to address?

385
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:01,750
So, there are many things
that are important for prom,

386
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:05,879
but the most important thing,
is, uh, your date.

387
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,842
Hmm. What's going on?

397
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:13,321
That was... doesn't that...

398
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:18,222
Okay. Email tonight,
meeting adjourned, thank you guys.

399
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:22,580
Look, I know I'm no Heath Ledger,
but I know you like big gestures so...

400
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:25,792
Prom is my prom date
and it should be yours too.

401
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,173
<i>I mean, dude, the ukulele...</i>

402
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:35,051
Seriously? Have some self-respect.

403
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,470
Yeah, but he planned
the whole thing though.

404
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:38,846
Pretty fucking cute.

405
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,516
- Hey.
- Hey.

406
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:45,645
- Hey.
- Guys, I just had a serious CRAFT moment.

407
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,708
What did you play, Light as a feather,
stiff as a board? I love that game.

408
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:52,277
No. So I was sitting in the library,
and guess who walks in.

409
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:05,040
- Hey. Rebecca.
- Hey. What's up?

410
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,542
- A little light reading I see?
- Yeah.

411
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:10,128
My parents never done one,
so I'm just trying to sort through

412
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:12,630
and this one's my personal reading.

413
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:15,759
Ah, well, uh,

414
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:20,430
you know, sometimes
there's just no reason at all

415
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,934
- and there's nothing pure about it.
- Yeah.

416
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,479
Right.

417
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,483
I'll just, uh, you know,

418
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,495
- finish the shift.
- Yeah, nice seeing you.

419
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:30,142

What's up?

429
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:04,826
- Hey.
- Hey.

430
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:06,661
The water hot enough for you?

431
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:13,918
Have you ever masturbated to completion
next to a total stranger before?

432
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,088
Bemis is hot.

433
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:22,218
but in my fantasy,
it's Gore Vidal and Trent Reznor.

434
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,186
Is that fucking crazy?

435
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:33,354
Wait. So she knew you were masturbating?

436
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,565
She knew who I was fantasizing about.

437
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:38,127
I masturbate at school all the time,
it's a great burst of energy.

438
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:40,236
It totally focuses and relaxes you.

439
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,222
I'm never holding your hand again.

440
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:47,619
Okay. So, if you send a sext
to somebody and they text you back,

441
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:50,830
"O period K period", what do you reply?

442
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:52,916
Aaron Jakes is a douche.

443
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,068
Have you seen him again?

444
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,378
Just a few times,
late night at his house,

445
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,881
younger boy throwdown,
they do what you say.

446
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,300
Hm. Unless they turn you down.

447
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:07,305
Anyway, indifference
is the greatest aphrodisiac.

448
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:10,767
Yup, because Iceberg Slim said,
"You can't need the pussy."

449
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:12,727
And who is Iceberg Slim?

450
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,188
A great writer and renowned pimp.

451
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,983
- How did the meeting go, Meils?
- Dude, divorce stuff sucks.

452
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:24,405
My dad refuses to give Rosa benefits,
but then I see him and he gives me this.

453
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,115
That's fucking suck.

454
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,244
It's just such a fucking letdown,
you know.

455
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:33,581
And this bracelet's
like really fucking tacky.

456
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:37,252
- You should tell him it upsets you.
- No, you can't. He's a dick.

457
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,254
You might as well enjoy the perks.

458
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,714
I fucked up my eyeliner.

459
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:44,467
- This corner.
- Yeah.

460
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,511
Okay. So...

461
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,596
I have a little something.

462
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,518
It's Thomas' favorite.

463
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:04,403
Oh.

464
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:14,956
<i>♪ Happy birthday dear Thomas ♪</i>

465
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:20,128
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

466
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:30,346
Okay. To Thomas. All right.
Here we go, all right.

467
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,575
That was the one, good cake.

468
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:34,976
Very good cake.

469
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,728
Taxi's here bellas.

470
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:41,482
All right ladies, let's throw on
some slutty dresses and get fucked up.

471
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:44,628
- Is that what you're wearing?
- Yeah, I'm over it.

472
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:49,240
<i>♪ Give me my shot, give me my shot
Give me my shot, keep calm ♪</i>

473
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:53,745
<i>♪ Give me my shot, give me my shot

474
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:58,416

Give me my shot, keep calm ♪</i>

475
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,628
All right. Let's get schwatsy faced,

476
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:04,923
zanzi-bars? Shrooms?
I don't care, whatever, I'll get weird.

477
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:09,010
I'm gonna grab that blunt
from the Travises. Travis!

478
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,307
Oh.

479
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,441
Okay. I'm, I'll go to the bathroom.

480
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,115
A lot of Wagner biographies.

481
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,535
You go to Catcher High?

482
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:38,622
That's a bummer.

483
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:40,917
Uh-hmm. You a Path girl?

484
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Hmm.

485
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,756
Enjoy yourself.

486
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,549
Yeah, you too.

487
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,178
Psst. Madame President?

488
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:54,597
What the fuck?

489
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:03,022
Were you waiting out here
for me with a joint?

490
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:06,567
I was. Uh, it's an apology joint.

491
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:11,739
No. I should apologize.

492
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,826
You were really sweet. I was...

493
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:17,537
I was a really big bitch, I'm sorry.

494
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,373
No. You weren't a bitch, you weren't.

495
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:23,501
I, it's, most guys look so cool to you

496
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:28,464
and I thought that I would join the ranks
of those great uke players, but, uhm...

497
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:31,426
I found out
that I'm not one of those guys,

498
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:35,263
and I feel really bad
that I embarrassed you, I, I didn't...

499
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,891
- I'm just not that kind of girl.
- Yeah.

500
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,977
- Yeah. Uhm, and, and plus,
- Okay.

501
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,271
I already have dates.

502
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,523
I thought prom was your date?

503
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:50,778
Well, the girls and I
were probably gonna go together.

504
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:54,866
Yeah, but, I mean, who are they
gonna dance with during slow songs?

505
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:58,995
You'll be the one running shit,
they can't dance with you.

506
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:03,875
Besides, I thought it might be nice
if you have someone to give you their coat

507
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:04,958
if you get cold.

508
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,803
Fuck. I'm a bitch.
That would be nice. You...

509
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:17,805
You're so nice, you are. It's just,
I have a lot of things...

510
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,023
I'm not that nice.

511
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,745
Okay. So, let's just hold our horses.

512
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:42,264
- I'm here with my girls.
- Oh, no. No. No. Don't...

513
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:45,291
Look, it's dark outside,
you're probably really drunk,

514
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:47,227
I could be anyone to you.
So, if we're gonna do this,

515
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,294
you need to come over

516
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,589
in the afternoon,
it's much better lighting.

517
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:52,672
Give me your phone.

518
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:01,766
You are really fucking nice. Thank you.

519
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,600
- See you.
- Bye.

520
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,978
Bye. Thank you.

521
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:10,817
Fuck yeah.

522
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,781
Well, this is fucking cute.

523
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:20,660
Meanwhile, my chocolate chunk prom date
is over there feeling on some

524
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:22,495
just-started-birth-control-titties.

525
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:26,749
Fuck Aaron Jakes
and screw that tiny Tinkerbell cunt.

526
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,876
I mean, what are we gonna do
about tree next year?

527
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,372
That East Coast weed
is some schwag-ass shit.

528
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:35,716
I feel like we're gonna be doing,
like, cool, like, brooding winter drugs,

529
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,260
like, opium,

530
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:38,718
you know?

531
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,889
Chloe? Earth to Chloe.

532
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,306
What's up?

533
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,102
I, uhm,

534
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,356
I got into NYU this morning.

535
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,199
- You better fucking stop.
- Oh, my God.

536
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,318
- Dude?
- Really?

537
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,464
- Hm-mmm.
- What? What's wrong?

538
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:57,905
You love Ol' West City.

539
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:03,870
I think I wanna go to UCSB,
like, be close to my mom and stuff.

540
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,205
Have you to talked to Lil?

541
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,500
Oh, sorry, excuse me. Hey.

542
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:15,339
Hey. They attached a trash bag
to a vaporizer, it's fucking dope, hit it.

543
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,775
Wait, what happened to your lip?

544
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:24,015
Younger boy throwdown?

545
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:25,725
You fought a little boy?

546
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:27,392
Mmm. Yeah.

547
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,730
- What? Did I miss something?
- ...are star people.

548
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:36,194
Oh, my God, something’s off
in PussTown USA. I'm so sorry.

549
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:42,116
Uh, ah, Chloe, I know I said get weird
and do shrooms and shit,

550
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,577
maybe, maybe you're getting
a little too weird?

551
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:48,372
There's nothing weird about
just hanging with your prom date.

552
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:53,252
But hold on,
what about those shrooms, though?

553
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,713
It's disgusting,
there's splash everywhere.

554
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:58,965
Damn it.

555
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,475
Cops, cops with dogs.

556
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,101
Shit. Go. Go.

557
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:12,688
- Ah. Becks. Where's Becks? Where...
- Find her. Find her, meet me outside, go.

558
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,608
Got a little roof on there. A little roof.

559
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,172
Oh, what the...

560
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:42,343
Ah! Ah! What the fuck! Really?

561
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,238
- Becks.
- Becks? Becks.

562
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,931
- No.
- Cops, cops, cops. Come on.

563
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:49,141
Guys, I pulled out two tampons.

564
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:51,269
- Dude, gross.
- I know.

565
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:53,771
- How long were they in there?
- One was mummified.

566
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,648
- So, they're like all...
- Yeah.

567
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,650
- Like a loom.
- No.

568
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:59,902
Like Penelope fighting off suitors.

569
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:03,656
Okay. Come on, we got to go. Come on.

570
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,328
All right.
Party's over, let's go.

571
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,133
Where are you ladies going?

572
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,167
- Uhm...
- Yeah?

573
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:19,297
Our friend Rebecca here
just had two tampons inside of her,

574
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,215
and it was quite a struggle
to get them out.

575
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:25,761
Maybe you, you have a, a daughter

576
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:28,222
and you know how difficult tampons
can be sometimes.

577
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:31,976
Yeah. She's got a point.
Nora just turned 13.

578
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:34,162
I spent an hour outside the bathroom
yelling through the door,

579
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:36,522
"Just shove it up there." Tampons.

580
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:41,152
All right, ladies, that's it, come on,
party's over. Let's go. Be safe. Come on.

581
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:44,655
Thank you, officers. Thank you.

582
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,641
- Anyone else?
- Oh, oh, oh.

583
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,201
There is this book,
it's called <i>It's Perfectly Normal,</i>

584
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:52,163
it talks about everything
from discharge to tampons,

585
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:54,498
you should really check it out.
Thank you so much.

586
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,961
That's the most times
I’ve heard the word tampon ever.

587
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:00,880
Did she just say discharge?

588
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:07,303
Hey.
Croissants to soak up the poison

589
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:09,055
that is rotting in your stomachs.

590
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,390
Oh, Mr. Bemis loves croissants.

591
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:15,561
I feel like your period
is punctuated by two huge dumps,

592
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:19,065
- one at the beginning and one at the end.
- Oh, we're synched. Mc-lin-tock.

593
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,116
Yeah, I'm just happy,
I won’t have it at prom.

594
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,820
Oh, yeah, which apparently
you are going to with Sam,

595
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:29,116
- that's a subtle ditch, Judas.
- Oh, your face. I can’t. Too hung over.

596
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:30,408
Where's the tree?

597
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,496
I think we’re Treeless in Seattle.

598
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:36,332
- Not even One Tree Hill?
- Nothing.

599
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,752
All I’ve got are these weird
weed mint strips.

600
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:41,128
Those even work?

601
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,714
I don't know, we’ll see.
Either have really fresh breath

602
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,091
or we'll be really high.

603
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,094
Cheers.

604
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,665
- Cheers bitches.
- Mazel tov.

605
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:57,853
<i>I Am Legend</i> is how it will happen.
Someone will invent a cure for cancer

606
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,439
and the vaccine will make everyone
a zombie brain-eater.

607
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,691
<i>I Am Legend</i>?

608
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:04,651
Okay...

609
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:10,616
Would you rather have penises for fingers
or vaginas for ears?

610
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,743
Hmm, do the penises get hard?

611
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:14,870
Yes.

612
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:17,123
Okay. But like can you control them
when they're hard?

613
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:21,001
The thing with dick fingers,
is that you cannot wear rings,

614
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:24,213
but if you have vaginal ears,
you can wear earrings.

615
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,381
Like bling?

616
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,341
- Like Vling.
- Vling.

617
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,637
Wait, wait, wait, wait, girl,
listen, listen, listen.

618
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,056
Yeah, what's up? Okay. What if

619
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,392
you have dick fingers and vagina ears?

620
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:37,934
- Oh.
- Yeah.

621
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:43,399
Like, oh,
like I've literally fucked my brains out.

622
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,401
I've got brains coming out of my nose

623
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:49,363
and jizz all over my head
and I haven't even made dinner yet.

624
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,240
I'm making hamburger helpers.

625
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:52,323
Eww.

626
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,743
- Liv!
- Liv!

627
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:57,139
- Oh yeah. Here's my baby sister!
- There she is.

628
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:59,415
Wait, Liv, you’re in sixth grade?

629
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,625
- Yeah?
- Dude,

630
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,711
- my boobs were so big at sixth grade.
- That is...

631
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,713
Yeah. That is the best fucking year,

632
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,274
- it's gonna be the best year of your life.
- I hope not.

633
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,442
- I promise.
- I hope you're the best.

634
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,508
I promise.

635
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:14,138
Oh no. Lil, I think Stella
ate your breath strips.

636
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,100
Oh, Stella.

637
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,228
You guys really like fresh breath.

638
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:23,397
Stella.

639
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:26,233
How are you feeling girl?

640
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,402
Trippin' balls...

641
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,696
Huge, sweaty balls...

642
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,616
You're gonna get through this.

643
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,076
I don't know man...

644
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:39,788
Oh. Her breath smells like someone
hot boxed a toothpaste factory.

645
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,502
Prom tickets, 15 dollars.

646
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,087
Seriously guys, they're 15 bucks.

647
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:49,048
Okay. After party tickets,

648
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:51,800
Forty bucks apiece. Leggo.

649
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:54,845
This is bullshit,
why do they want your tickets?

650
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:58,474
Look, after Party is more important
than prom, all right?

651
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:03,145
Prom is just an excuse for girls
to get fancy dresses and fake tans.

652
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:07,983
And to make memories

653
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:11,820
in a beautiful atmosphere,
all right, expertly created

654
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:14,657
- by dedicated Student Council members.
- Hm-mmm.

655
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:17,243
Look, you care too much. They smell it.

656
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:21,097
Look, wanting people to be happy
and have a good time, that's a bad thing?

657
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:24,291
No, it's just letting people
have a good time is better.

658
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:26,793
Thank you.

659
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,881
Look, you know, it’s fine
that you asked Chloe to prom,

660
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:33,246
but you should've talked to me first.
What about bro code?

661
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:34,986
I’m sorry. I didn’t want to upset you,

662
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,845
- okay?
- Whatever. It's cool.

663
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:40,933
I mean, I guess if she's not gonna go
with me, you’re the next best thing.

664
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,560
All right. We good?

665
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:43,644
Yeah, we're cool.

666
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,354
- All right, thank you.
- All right.

667
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:48,314
Oh, God.

668
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,901
Meils. Meils, are you okay?

669
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:54,488
I came here to give that
little piece of shit a piece of my mind.

670
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:55,614
Piece of shit? Oh.

671
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:58,993
Aaron Jakes. You know that little
taint-troll? Is he around here?

672
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:02,246
All right, you know, you take that,
I'm gonna get this one home.

673
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:03,689
- Please do.
- All right. Let's go.

674
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,125
Oh, shit, better grab Liv, come on.

675
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:09,628
Aaron?

676
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:15,050
I love him.

677
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,265
Liv...

678
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,226
what’s wrong?

679
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:28,373
I got in trouble, because James
wrote something really gross

680
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:29,773
in my paper on governments.

681
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:30,899
- What?
- James,

682
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,985
he must've gone
on the computer when it was up.

683
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:34,235
What did it say?

684
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:37,323
In the paragraph on oligarchies it said,

685
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:40,117
"I like to sneak in
and watch my dad take showers."

686
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,453
It’s not funny.

687
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,789
He’s so mean, it really hurts me.

688
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:49,960
Older brothers are gonna make fun of you.
All right? That's just what they do.

689
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:53,130
James just sees you as a kid right now,
soon enough you'll be friends.

690
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:54,590
But seriously, you have to admit.

691
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:56,925
"I sneak in and watch my dad
take showers", that's funny.

692
00:43:58,093 --> 00:44:00,304
Wait, who told you guys about that?

693
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:04,808
Okay. That only happened once, okay?

694
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,978
And Liv, it was really scary.
Never do it, okay?

695
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:10,939
It's like,
it's like an angry sea monster.

696
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,446
Hey, look, look,
I'll talk to James, all right?

697
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:19,323
- All right.
- Okay. Love you.

698
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:21,325
- Love you. Bye.
- Bye.

699
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:23,744
-Bye, Liv.

700
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:24,995
- Bye.
- Jesus.

701
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:31,001
Ugh, fuck. I want froyo.

702
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:34,338
Hey, do you think we’re fucked up,

703
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:36,501
because of our fucked up relationships
with our dads?

704
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,093
Uh, you don’t have a relationship
with your dad.

705
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:41,095
You know what I mean.

706
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:45,849
Well, yeah, I mean,
everyone's dad fucks them up.

707
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:50,229
Like, I see my dad and I'm like,
fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.

708
00:44:50,687 --> 00:44:56,235
But then, you know, I wanna see him
and I still want him to wanna see me.

709
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:57,318
Yeah.

710
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:00,406
I mean, I never felt like I needed mine.

711
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,658
I always have my mom, I have you guys.

712
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:07,079
Mmm, but either your dad fucks you up,
because he's not there

713
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:09,415
or your dad fucks you up,
because he's there

714
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:12,000
and honestly
nobody can live up to that shit.

715
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:13,334
Right.

716
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:17,034
But I guess, until then,
he's still gonna get laid, right?

717
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:19,049
Yeah.

718
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:21,935
Hey, dickwad,
can I talk to you for a second?

719
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:26,974
Your little essay addition,

720
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:29,707
you have anything to say about that?

721
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:38,652
Oh! You're repulsive.
That is disgusting. God, dear God.

722
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,406
Okay.

723
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:46,761
You know how many peoples' games you just
ruined? Abdul’s gonna be pissed at me.

724
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:48,787
Oh, cry me a river, Leroy Jenkins.

725
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,622
Dude, this is serious.

726
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:52,676
It's a joke.
She's not gonna get in trouble.

727
00:45:52,749 --> 00:45:54,668
No, it’s not about school, it’s about her.

728
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:57,650
Poor thing, she thinks that you hate her.
She needs you. Look,

729
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:01,625
we’re the only other people who know
what we’ve been through, all right? And...

730
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:04,386
you know, pretty soon, your friends,

731
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,822
they're gonna wanna bang her
and if you're not nicer,

732
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:08,366
- she, she's probably gonna do it.
- Dude, don’t talk about my friends

733
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:12,227
- fucking my baby sister.
- Look, you talked about her peep-holeing

734
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:14,771
her own dad in writing,
in writing to her teacher.

735
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:17,191
Uh, yeah, but that's funny,

736
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,074
because we don't have a dad.

737
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:20,819
Seriously?

738
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,530
Noah
Hang? I'm nearby.

739
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:27,826
- Where are you going?
- Read a book.

740
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:34,374
And this is
where the magic happens.

741
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:36,418
This is awesome.

742
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:38,086
Thanks. How was your day?

743
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:44,468
Uh, It was, it was good. Uhm, that guy Ken
was a dick in Academic Journal.

744
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:47,179
There’s this like, this freshman girl...

745
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:51,767
Oh, my God. This is really out of tune.
It's horrible.

746
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:55,687
So there's this freshman girl who wears
those kind of like <i>risqué</i> stuff

747
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:59,900
and he makes these gross comments about it
and she's so fucking schevvy like...

748
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:04,655
Young male teachers have a hard time
handling a burgeoning young woman, so...

749
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:12,496
Yes, well, you are very burgeoning.

750
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:14,891
Look, I'll talk to him,
if he's got a problem with her,

751
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:17,167
he should really
have a female counselor speak to her.

752
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:20,462
I, uhm, I wasn't listening
to anything you just said.

753
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:24,466
See, you would've missed all this
in the dark, drunken stupor of the party.

754
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:47,864
- Hey, that just tickles.
- Yeah.

755
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,199
I got it.

756
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:53,495
Wow.

757
00:47:58,542 --> 00:47:59,585
Can I take these off?

758
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,880
That is so hot that you asked,
yes, please, take them off.

759
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:13,849
Okay. So, uhm...

760
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:17,203
I'm gonna get really quiet, but it,
it's not that it doesn't feel good.

761
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,812
It's, it's because that it does

762
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:22,524
and I just wanna focus on that moaning.
It's too distracting.

763
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:31,450
11 minutes later...

764
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:33,577
Keep going. Right there, I'm gonna cum.

765
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:36,829
Okay, wait.

766
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,086
Are you fucking kidding me?

767
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:45,921
Fuck me.

768
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:47,131
Okay.

769
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:53,347
You're fucking beautiful.

770
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:58,268
Okay. Reciprocity.

771
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:01,063
- What?
- Take these off.

772
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:10,989
Oh, fuck.

773
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:14,660
Look <i>moi</i>. No hands.

774
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:16,244
That's awesome.

775
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,079
Oh, fuck.

776
00:49:18,955 --> 00:49:20,916
Afternoon Delight is the best.

777
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:22,918
- Hey.
- You're amazing.

778
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:25,337
Yeah. Yeah, that was, that was awesome.

779
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:28,215
I'm gonna... a lot of energy
for the game now. Thanks.

780
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:32,135
Hey, so, uhm, listen. Would you ever
wanna come over to my house

781
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:36,556
and, like, have dinner with my parents
and just, like, hang out with my family?

782
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:44,773
Uhm, yeah, I, I would love to come over
and meet your parents as a mentor,

783
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:50,487
guidance figure in your life. But, uhm,
I mean, they'll really like me

784
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:55,450
and you'll like that and that's, that's,
that's just bad news for everyone, so...

785
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,953
Well, well, I mean, I already like you.

786
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:01,224
Like, I'm not trying to date you.
I, I know that you have to leave soon

787
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:04,126
and my crazy ex would kill me if...

788
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:05,228
What, the one from Catcher?

789
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:06,932
Yeah. Yeah.
They're gonna play her tonight.

790
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:10,149
You got to watch out. She got wind
of this and she's, she's really pissed.

791
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:12,926
All right, ladies,
we want a good, clean game.

792
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:14,970
Tough with these messy skanks.

793
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,679
- Excuse me?
- Call it.

794
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,765
- Heads.
- You would.

795
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:21,226
- What does that even mean?
- Heads it is.

796
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:36,908
Run that shit.

797
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:39,953
Independent women.

798
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:43,915
- You know, he was at my place last night.
- Well, that's cool. I'm a sharer.

799
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,792
Stay away from him, cock goblin.

800
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:50,629
Oh.

801
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:51,840
Boo!

802
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:55,427
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
- What the fuck?

803
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:58,054
Ref, your voicemail box is full,
you missed the ball.

804
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:12,152
No one's gonna go for that...

805
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:15,572
Done, bitch.

806
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:19,326
Keanu Reeves's mother
is actually Asian.

807
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:21,578
So, that's why <i>The Matrix</i> is pretty
cool.

808
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:25,248
Because, uh, some say it's based on
Baudrillard's <i>Simulacra and Simulation,</i>

809
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,918
but he refuted the comparison.
It's not even a thing.

810
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:31,797
I can't believe
what a raging bitch Noah's ex is.

811
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,423
Guys like crazy girls.

812
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:36,051
Yeah, I'm not getting involved
with that shit.

813
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:39,930
I am not playing <i>The Boy is Mine</i>
my last week of senior year.

814
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:42,015
Yo. You two right here?

815
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:44,882
You two were too fucking amazing tonight.
You know that?

816
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:48,647
Yeah. You know that moment
when you just know

817
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:50,291
you're not gonna be
a professional athlete?

818
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:52,317
- Hm-mmm.
- I kind of have one tonight.

819
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,404
Mmm, well, that moment that you had,
comes a little later for black folk.

820
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:58,615
Yes, but I get you though. I do.

821
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,993
So, uhm, celebratory roll

822
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:03,703
- for your victory, though?
- Ooh.

823
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:06,081
- Where did you get this?
- You don't need to know.

824
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:09,167
Okay, guys, seriously,
just, like, drink lots of water.

825
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:12,188
- Stay hydrated, please.
- Let's see you on the other side.

826
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:14,047
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:47,806
Yeah, what happened to you?

917
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:52,010
Last night was really fucked up.

918
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:56,361
- Yeah, we're pretty fucked up, right?
- No, you guys were fucked up to me.

919
01:00:58,571 --> 01:00:59,923
Guess you wanted
to get it in with Sam now,

920
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:01,115
since you can't at prom, huh?

921
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:05,119
- Why are you acting like this?
- I'm just trying to be honest.

922
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:09,999
Chloe is not going to prom.
Chloe is going to orientation at UCSB.

923
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:15,420
You guys knew?

924
01:01:17,256 --> 01:01:18,091
I had a feeling.

925
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:22,303
I hadn't heard from NYU,
UCSB was sounding like the smart option,

926
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:24,222
Lil. Maybe the thing that I wanna do.

927
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:27,600
Oh, you hadn't heard?
And, and now you know, right?

928
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:32,021
And you didn't tell me?

929
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:34,857
I didn't wanna say anything
before prom and ruin anything.

930
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:37,568
Ruin anything?
What about our fucking lives, Clo?

931
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:40,405
- Calm down, Lily. This is good for us.
- Yeah. Yeah. This is great.

932
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:43,282
Let's all just be alone,
that's a great way to go through life.

933
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:47,245
You know what?
Last night was a little preview.

934
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:49,142
You are fucked up and you're confused

935
01:01:49,622 --> 01:01:51,975
and you're feeling all sorts
of new emotions and then all of a sudden,

936
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:54,239
you're in a dark room
with some sweaty guy on top of you,

937
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:55,521
- but none of your friends will care,
- What?

938
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:56,462
because none of your friends
are gonna be there

939
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:58,399
and you're gonna be
absolutely fucking on your own.

940
01:01:58,423 --> 01:02:01,143
- What happened to you last night?
- What happened?

941
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:04,762
Nothing. A guy was...

942
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:08,182
was goal-oriented,
it was shitty. I'm fine,

943
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:10,435
but you guys ditched me
and that is not fine.

944
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:12,918
Lily, you went off
with some dude and didn't tell us?

945
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:16,083
- That's not our fault, Lil. We're...
- That's easy for you to say,

946
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:17,251
you're turning your back on us.

947
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:19,795
What are you, you think
you're gonna find some new best friends?

948
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:22,238
What? I owe you,
so I can't make any new friends?

949
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:27,936
All, I'm just saying, like,

950
01:02:29,287 --> 01:02:31,706
how could you be friends
with someone who didn't know Thomas?

951
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,042
Are you fucking serious?

952
01:02:36,043 --> 01:02:38,588
I can't be friends with anyone
who didn't know my dead brother?

953
01:02:40,214 --> 01:02:41,614
Jesus fucking Christ, Lily.

954
01:02:41,674 --> 01:02:44,218
He didn't die
so we could be best friends forever.

955
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:46,697
We can still all be best friends.

956
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:49,849
- Yeah.
- No. No, because she is fucking up

957
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:51,392
the friend ecosystem.

958
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:54,353
Like, I'm the glue here, but without Clo,

959
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:57,023
your boy crazy ass
is gonna be with some dude.

960
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:58,459
Your fuckin' head
is gonna be in the clouds.

961
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:00,586
Yeah, my head's in the clouds,
because I’m, like, worrying about

962
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:03,738
paying for loans and school and shit
that's never even entered your mind.

963
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:07,784
Yeah, and I'm boy crazy?
Guys drive you fucking nuts, dude.

964
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:12,997
Look, you don't deal. Your dad is gone.
The guy that you were in love with, died.

965
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:16,918
- I'm sorry for the truth bomb.
- You know what?

966
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:19,003
Lil, I'm just thinking about it.

967
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:22,673
Every guy you've loved, has left.

968
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:27,512
Okay, fuck! Fuck. I'm not trying
to psychoanalyze myself right now.

969
01:03:34,101 --> 01:03:35,812
- I'm outta here.
- This is your house.

970
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:37,522
Yeah, make yourself at fucking home.

971
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:42,985
This is an awkward moment,
but I feel like, uh, I have a coffee date,

972
01:03:43,402 --> 01:03:45,404
potential roommate situation.
Could you drive me?

973
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:46,965
- I got you.
- Okay.

974
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:49,617
Okay. She's gonna go. That was fucked up.

975
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:52,786
Come on. Let's go.

976
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:56,082
Hey. Lil.

977
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:02,088
What the fuck is going on with you?

978
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:04,251
I can't believe
you don't wanna go to school with me.

979
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:07,009
and I seriously cannot believe
that you lied to me about it.

980
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:10,304
This is fucking bullshit. You are
too smart to be acting this pathetic.

981
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,033
You clearly don't understand at all

982
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:15,494
- where I'm coming from.
- No, clearly you don't understand.

983
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:20,898
All your cherishing every moment and prom
and your weird fucking memorials.

984
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:23,794
Since Thomas died, you've gone
into overdrive. It's fucking oppressive.

985
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:25,695
Yeah, this terrible thing happened

986
01:04:25,778 --> 01:04:28,298
and I'm just trying to get us through it.
I'm trying to make it better.

987
01:04:28,322 --> 01:04:30,408
Yeah, this terrible thing happened,

988
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:34,412
but it doesn't mean everything else
has to be peachy fucking keen, Lily.

989
01:04:34,787 --> 01:04:36,497
Meils' parents still suck,

990
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:39,417
Becks still has to worry about money,
your dad is still gone,

991
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:42,962
I still have to deal with the gaping
fucking hole that's left in my family.

992
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:47,091
- Life is hard and it keeps being hard.
- Clo, I know that.

993
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:50,970
This has been really tough for me, too.

994
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:53,389
- Oh, my God.
- And every time I try to talk to you

995
01:04:53,806 --> 01:04:55,576
- about it...
- Okay, but we are different, Lil.

996
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:58,394
- Our shit is different.
- Yeah. I miss him, too.

997
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:06,444
Okay. Well, you know what?
Sometimes you don't get to tell me that.

998
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:10,031
You’re right, I, I'm not blood,

999
01:05:11,198 --> 01:05:12,909
but he was something else for me.

1000
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,953
Dude, whatever you thought he was,

1001
01:05:16,662 --> 01:05:20,082
- he was actually my brother.
- Dude, I know.

1002
01:05:26,714 --> 01:05:29,175
And I, I, was, I was trying
to make this time special.

1003
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:33,155
All right? I was trying to make our future special,
because, Clo, I don't know what I would do if I lost you.

1004
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:35,139
Stop. Stop.

1005
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:41,228
Oh, my God, I can't...
with this psycho girlfriend act.

1006
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:44,148
This isn't you and I know it.

1007
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:57,870
<i>♪ I'm okay alone ♪</i>

1008
01:05:59,872 --> 01:06:03,918
<i>♪ It makes my soul stir ♪</i>

1009
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:11,717
<i>♪ Under microscopes ♪</i>

1010
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:14,303
Oh. How adorable.

1011
01:06:15,262 --> 01:06:18,182
You know, college is gonna be
so great. We don't need any friends.

1012
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:21,286
Yeah. We can totally reinvent ourselves
as sloppy skanks who don't need anyone

1013
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:23,020
and gain 15 pounds.

1014
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:27,942
God, shit buckets.

1015
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:31,696
Fuck.

1016
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:43,043
- Hello.
- What's going on back there?

1017
01:06:43,624 --> 01:06:45,626
- I'm sorry, I, I was...
- Texting?

1018
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:48,004
- Thinking?
- Well...

1019
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:50,065
you can't just stay still,
you have to keep moving.

1020
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:51,841
- I know.
- And other people have places

1021
01:06:51,924 --> 01:06:54,427
- to go, too, so you can't stop them.
- No, I, I know that.

1022
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:58,264
There is a whole life happening
all around you and you can't control it

1023
01:06:58,389 --> 01:07:00,224
just by stopping whenever you please

1024
01:07:00,307 --> 01:07:02,285
and decide everybody else
just have to fall into place.

1025
01:07:02,309 --> 01:07:03,644
I get it, fuck!

1026
01:07:07,231 --> 01:07:08,274
Have you been smoking?

1027
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:10,442
No.

1028
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,486
Then what's that bong in the backseat?

1029
01:07:12,945 --> 01:07:17,945
Oh, that donk... That's funny. That's a, a sculpture that I, I
made in school. It is. I, we're, I, I'm Student Body President.

1030
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:24,874
I'm a good kid. I am. I just,
I have a lot on my plate right now.

1031
01:07:24,957 --> 01:07:27,334
I'm so stressed out.
I, I, I'm graduating.

1032
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:29,058
- Right now...
- Are you going to college?

1033
01:07:29,253 --> 01:07:30,546
Yeah, Columbia.

1034
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:34,925
- It's a university.
- Oh, it is? It's not just a country?

1035
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,320
Now, I wonder if the people at Columbia

1036
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:40,556
would be excited to find out
that one of their future students

1037
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:43,184
- was arrested for possession.
- What?

1038
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:45,811
I don't know
what the fuck you're thinking

1039
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:48,689
driving around with a bong
in the backseat of your car.

1040
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:50,399
Who do you think you are, Willie Nelson?

1041
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:53,027
Now, even he got arrested.

1042
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:54,570
You're arresting me?

1043
01:07:57,406 --> 01:08:00,743
All right. Look, I'm not,
I'm not gonna ruin your life forever.

1044
01:08:01,702 --> 01:08:03,287
Oh, thank God. Thank you.

1045
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:07,291
But I am gonna fuck it up
for about a week.

1046
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:11,212
God,
you could be in jail right now.

1047
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:15,633
I can't believe
you would do something so stupid!

1048
01:08:15,716 --> 01:08:18,052
Mom, I'm a really safe driver.
I was just distracted.

1049
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:19,219
Yeah, but...

1050
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:21,763
Lil...

1051
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:25,059
- Smash it.
- No.

1052
01:08:25,142 --> 01:08:26,477
- Yes.
- Mom.

1053
01:08:26,685 --> 01:08:27,895
This is Donkey Bong.

1054
01:08:28,312 --> 01:08:30,207
All right? He has been with us
through all of high school.

1055
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:31,273
Thomas smoked out of this.

1056
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:33,442
Smash it.

1057
01:08:33,692 --> 01:08:36,570
I wasn't even smoking. I was sad driving!

1058
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:38,197
What's sad driving?

1059
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,950
Rebecca was,
she was sitting with her new roommate.

1060
01:08:41,033 --> 01:08:43,744
Chloe's not going to NYU.
She fucking hates me

1061
01:08:43,828 --> 01:08:46,468
and she's, she's ditching prom
for the orientation of her new life.

1062
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:51,210
Okay. So, be happy for her,
you should be supportive of her choices.

1063
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:53,563
But her choices, they're wrong.
She’s making a huge mistake.

1064
01:08:53,587 --> 01:08:55,464
She is ruining our lives.

1065
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:57,716
Lily, she wants a change.

1066
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:00,719
It's not some affront
to what you guys share together.

1067
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:02,531
- Yes, it is. That's exactly what it is.
- No...

1068
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:04,390
No wonder she wants to get away from you.

1069
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:06,851
- Mom, why are you yelling at me
- Because

1070
01:09:06,934 --> 01:09:09,311
- about this?
- You're being a monster.

1071
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:13,023
You think you know everything?
You don't know shit.

1072
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:16,569
Now learn your lesson
and smash your bong!

1073
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:21,027
Really good parenting, mom.

1074
01:09:24,743 --> 01:09:26,745
Well, fuck.

1075
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:28,956
Fuck.

1076
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:31,332
Fuck. Fuck.

1077
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:34,586
Fuck.

1078
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:44,430
<i>Hey, this is Chloe.
Leave a message.</i>

1079
01:09:55,316 --> 01:10:00,613
<i>Hey, guys, it's Meils.
Uhm, I don't check my messages. So...</i>

1080
01:10:01,488 --> 01:10:03,240
<i>see you when I see you, motherfucker.</i>

1081
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:10,915
<i>Hi, it's Rebecca. I'm not here
right now, so leave a message. Bye.</i>

1082
01:10:17,296 --> 01:10:19,381
<i>Bergbaum-Goldwyn Residence One.</i>

1083
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:22,343
Hi Rosa, uhm, is Chloe over there?

1084
01:10:23,093 --> 01:10:26,555
<i>Chloe, Beck, Melia. Where are you?</i>

1085
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:44,178
You need any help, Madame President?

1086
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,074
Stop.

1087
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:50,222
I, uh, I couldn't find you
at the party the other night.

1088
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:52,726
- I wanted to congratulate you...
- It's a little vicious, huh?

1089
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:54,917
- What?
- You and Jessica are still involved.

1090
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:57,229
- Don't you think that's a little hurtful?
- Jessica and I have a bond,

1091
01:10:57,253 --> 01:11:00,213
but her being completely insane keeps us
from ever being in a relationship.

1092
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:02,590
We're not together.

1093
01:11:04,009 --> 01:11:06,679
I like spending time with you.
I care about you.

1094
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:08,322
Yeah, well, I don't wanna be that girl.

1095
01:11:09,306 --> 01:11:12,118
Yeah, you made that pretty clear
when you blew-and-dashed the other day.

1096
01:11:12,142 --> 01:11:14,037
- You couldn't turn me down fast enough.
- Yeah, clearly,

1097
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:17,101
because you were shoving your tongue
down your ex's throat a few hours later.

1098
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:20,067
Wait, I wanted to be with you
and now you're jealous?

1099
01:11:20,567 --> 01:11:22,444
Oh God. Don't flatter yourself.

1100
01:11:23,737 --> 01:11:26,457
You know, for someone who's so nice,
you're actually kind of a bitch.

1101
01:11:28,492 --> 01:11:30,828
- Wow.
- Wow what?

1102
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:33,747
Are you gonna talk to me?

1103
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:37,668
No? Okay, awesome. Fuck you.

1104
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:42,880
Whatever.

1105
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:06,113
- Hey.
- Hey.

1106
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:10,868
- What's wrong?
- Everything.

1107
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:16,832
No, it's just prom shit. What's up?

1108
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:19,209
Uhm...

1109
01:12:20,586 --> 01:12:22,755
It's stupid but, uhm...

1110
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:24,673
What's Chloe's favorite color?

1111
01:12:25,632 --> 01:12:27,843
- It's for her corsage.
- She's not going.

1112
01:12:28,969 --> 01:12:34,141
Oh. And so she's, uh,
going to the pre-frosh orientation thing.

1113
01:12:34,224 --> 01:12:35,768
Yeah, right, of course you knew.

1114
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:39,271
Oh, uh, well, she had mentioned
something about it.

1115
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:41,482
Okay. I got to go get streamers.

1116
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:52,534
It's green, for what it's worth.

1117
01:12:53,577 --> 01:12:54,577
Thanks.

1118
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:56,413
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

1119
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:02,123
What are you doing?

1120
01:13:03,337 --> 01:13:04,797
Figuring out what to wear to prom.

1121
01:13:05,964 --> 01:13:07,049
Paper bag should do.

1122
01:13:07,925 --> 01:13:09,134
Oh, you mean on your body.

1123
01:13:15,474 --> 01:13:16,474
Stop.

1124
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:18,769
- Are you on your period?
- Yes.

1125
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:22,601
I think that actual steam
just came out of your ears.

1126
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,528
This is pretty.

1127
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:30,322
Dude, no, do not.
You're gonna stretch it.

1128
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:33,158
My slender boyish figure
is the stuff that trannies dream of.

1129
01:13:34,201 --> 01:13:35,201
Talk.

1130
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:37,704
Mom's pissed at me.

1131
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:41,083
Yeah, but you know she'll deal.
What's really going on?

1132
01:13:43,961 --> 01:13:45,170
All the girls hate me.

1133
01:13:46,046 --> 01:13:49,883
Which kind of makes sense,
I've pretty much sucked lately.

1134
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:53,846
I mean, you are a freak. But,
uh, I mean, you've always been like that.

1135
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:58,298
You know, I mean,
maybe you've been a bit, uh...

1136
01:13:59,143 --> 01:14:01,812
you know, like BFFAEAE this year

1137
01:14:01,895 --> 01:14:03,397
with your power pussy posse.

1138
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:07,359
But, uh, you know,
I mean, your expiration dating.

1139
01:14:07,734 --> 01:14:10,296
You know, I mean, you taught me that.
It's like, uh, you know, like camp dude,

1140
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,197
summer was over and he was like, uh,

1141
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:14,926
he was like, "Oh, you're so hot,"
you know, "you give the best handys,

1142
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:17,035
we're gonna AIM all the time
and all that shit."

1143
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:21,266
It's like when you know things are ending,
you freak out, and you try to hold on

1144
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:23,709
and then it gets weird waiting it out.

1145
01:14:27,087 --> 01:14:28,672
When did you get so wise?

1146
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:31,467
I'm surrounded by brilliant women.

1147
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:37,389
- You got to get a new mindset.
- What? Like an emotional pre-game?

1148
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:39,183
It's like feel shitty or be alone.

1149
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:44,330
You know, I mean, dad left
the night before our Disneyland trip.

1150
01:14:45,063 --> 01:14:47,083
You know, we didn't go. I mean,
that shit's gonna fuck me up

1151
01:14:47,107 --> 01:14:48,901
for the rest of my life, but it's chill.

1152
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:52,779
C.A.R.L. 4ever

1153
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:54,030
C.A.R.L. forever?

1154
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:56,340
- Shut up.
- What are you, a gay trucker?

1155
01:15:02,414 --> 01:15:03,707
I'll leave you to wallow now.

1156
01:15:06,585 --> 01:15:07,669
- Take it off.
- Nope.

1157
01:15:16,803 --> 01:15:18,180
Hi, Robert, it's Jill.

1158
01:15:20,307 --> 01:15:24,561
Just calling, 'cause our daughter's
high school graduation is coming up...

1159
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:28,649
Valedictorian.

1160
01:15:30,108 --> 01:15:31,151
Speech.

1161
01:15:32,402 --> 01:15:34,404
Gonna be a, a big one.

1162
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:38,492
Yeah, could make up
for all the others that you missed,

1163
01:15:39,159 --> 01:15:42,704
maybe. Olivia and James are, are well.
They're becoming really...

1164
01:15:44,331 --> 01:15:47,793
just wonderful, smart people.

1165
01:15:47,918 --> 01:15:50,212
I think you'd really like them.

1166
01:15:52,631 --> 01:15:54,508
I do. I think you'd really like them.

1167
01:15:55,926 --> 01:16:00,764
Anyway, I'd say talk soon, but I think
we both know that's not gonna happen.

1168
01:16:00,847 --> 01:16:06,520
Okay? All right. Graduation, Tuesday.
If you give a shit, go fuck yourself.

1169
01:16:06,603 --> 01:16:09,982
Okay. Okay, goodbye.
Go fuck... Yeah. Go fuck yourself.

1170
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:12,693

It was so funny, and then
I don't even know what's going on.

1193
01:19:00,277 --> 01:19:01,838
I can't believe
we're at prom though.

1194
01:19:01,862 --> 01:19:03,196
Thank God we got invited.

1195
01:19:03,363 --> 01:19:05,466
- But I need to be way more drunk.
- Me, too.

1196
01:19:05,490 --> 01:19:09,536
Oh. Slow your roll, girls,
the night is long.

1197
01:19:11,079 --> 01:19:12,079
Whiskey?

1198
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:14,749
Why not?

1199
01:19:27,053 --> 01:19:27,971
- Hi.
- What's up?

1200
01:19:28,054 --> 01:19:30,015
You, uh, you look beautiful.

1201
01:19:30,724 --> 01:19:33,602
- You look beautiful.
- All right, thank you.

1202
01:19:33,685 --> 01:19:36,485
Uhm, look, I just really wanted
to apologize for, for getting all weird

1203
01:19:36,521 --> 01:19:38,681
and walking away from you
the other day in the library.

1204
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:42,360
Loans categorically suck
and I'm still paying mine off.

1205
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:46,448
So, you know, If you ever wanna talk,
I can imagine it's not the kind of thing

1206
01:19:46,531 --> 01:19:48,867
that gets,
gets a lot of attention around here.

1207
01:19:49,034 --> 01:19:52,913
Yeah, it's not really a big topic of
conversation amongst my friends. You know.

1208
01:19:53,163 --> 01:19:57,209
But, uhm, it's very cool
that you are dealing with it now.

1209
01:19:58,251 --> 01:19:59,753
- Got to do it, so...
- Yeah.

1210
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:01,755
How's, uh, how's your date?

1211
01:20:02,923 --> 01:20:06,468
Uhm, it was just supposed
to be us girls, but things are changing.

1212
01:20:06,551 --> 01:20:09,054
Everyone's leaving, it's weird, you know.

1213
01:20:09,262 --> 01:20:12,516
Well, what endures
when all else has changed?

1214
01:20:12,724 --> 01:20:14,518
- It is love.
- It is love. Kierkegaard.

1215
01:20:14,601 --> 01:20:16,269
- Hm-mmm.
- I love that guy.

1216
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:17,770
- Yeah.
- You know, poet.

1217
01:20:18,021 --> 01:20:20,649
Well, look, just tell them
your love hasn't changed.

1218
01:20:21,191 --> 01:20:22,692
You'll only get so many chances.

1219
01:20:29,741 --> 01:20:32,744
- You sad about leaving?
- Not really.

1220
01:20:33,912 --> 01:20:35,539
I'm just glad I have another year here.

1221
01:20:36,373 --> 01:20:38,124
I can't imagine leaving this place.

1222
01:20:56,893 --> 01:20:58,019
<i>What are we doing?</i>

1223
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:04,150
You're leaving in a couple of months.
I, I don't know what Chloe's gonna do.

1224
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:07,195
Hey, Lil, this isn't some fling.

1225
01:21:11,408 --> 01:21:12,408
I love you.

1226
01:21:14,744 --> 01:21:15,744
Hey.

1227
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:19,583
Hey.

1228
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:24,796
You came back.

1229
01:21:27,048 --> 01:21:31,219
Mr. Bemis: What's a fart that sounds
and smells like nothing? A Sartre

1230
01:21:33,638 --> 01:21:34,681
I hate boys.

1231
01:21:35,056 --> 01:21:37,559
I know. We're ready for men.

1232
01:21:37,976 --> 01:21:41,563
No. You know what I need right now?
I need my dudes, where the fuck is Lily?

1233
01:21:41,646 --> 01:21:43,940
I don't know. I wish Clo was here, too.

1234
01:21:44,691 --> 01:21:46,276
I miss our token white friends.

1235
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:48,194
I know, it's ironic.

1236
01:21:56,661 --> 01:21:57,829
This just...

1237
01:21:59,706 --> 01:22:02,250
- Wasn't we had planned?
- Wasn't us.

1238
01:22:04,794 --> 01:22:07,088
God, that fuckhead Mike's in there.

1239
01:22:10,550 --> 01:22:13,261
They have fucked me up, just fucked up.

1240
01:22:14,846 --> 01:22:18,016
Lil, whatever happened
with that guy, I just...

1241
01:22:21,311 --> 01:22:22,437
I'm really sorry.

1242
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:26,191
I'm sorry.

1243
01:22:30,236 --> 01:22:32,072
I think I'm so fucking well-adjusted.

1244
01:22:32,155 --> 01:22:35,200
I'm not, I'm just this,
like, Stepford wife control freak.

1245
01:22:36,117 --> 01:22:37,160
I'm crazy.

1246
01:22:41,206 --> 01:22:43,875
And I'm so sorry
for being so intense about Thomas.

1247
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:48,630
I just wanted to be sad together.

1248
01:22:50,674 --> 01:22:53,426
I get it, sometimes you don't wanna talk,
and he's not my brother,

1249
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:55,830
and just because I was in love with him,
it doesn't mean...

1250
01:22:56,596 --> 01:22:58,515
He was in love with you, too, Lil.

1251
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:00,183
I know.

1252
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:02,602
He wrote me a letter about it.

1253
01:23:05,105 --> 01:23:06,356
Look, Lil...

1254
01:23:09,442 --> 01:23:10,986
It's gonna hurt forever.

1255
01:23:13,863 --> 01:23:15,365
It's part of who we are now.

1256
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:20,370
Mourning what was

1257
01:23:21,538 --> 01:23:22,706
and what is,

1258
01:23:23,915 --> 01:23:25,458
is sad enough, Lil.

1259
01:23:27,335 --> 01:23:30,380
I just, I can't take on mourning
something that could have been.

1260
01:23:32,799 --> 01:23:36,594
And, you know, whatever it is,
whatever is gonna happen,

1261
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:39,097
we're still gonna be us.

1262
01:23:44,352 --> 01:23:45,645
You're my life partner.

1263
01:23:56,614 --> 01:23:58,324
I'm sorry about your prom.

1264
01:23:59,284 --> 01:24:01,327
No, you are my prom.

1265
01:24:08,251 --> 01:24:09,461
Ready?

1266
01:24:18,762 --> 01:24:21,306
Oh! Look who decided to show.

1267
01:24:22,599 --> 01:24:24,239
- Come on, I couldn't miss prom.
- Hm-mmm.

1268
01:24:24,309 --> 01:24:27,312
Guys, I'm really sorry
for being such a psycho.

1269
01:24:27,479 --> 01:24:28,772
- It's okay.
- Yeah, it's okay.

1270
01:24:28,855 --> 01:24:30,735
You're like
the obsessive boyfriend I never had.

1271
01:24:31,483 --> 01:24:34,194
What is never changed
when everything's changed?

1272
01:24:34,861 --> 01:24:35,904
It is love.

1273
01:24:36,321 --> 01:24:38,531
Oh. I love you.

1274
01:24:38,656 --> 01:24:41,868
Now, I don't know what's gonna happen,
but I've got you guys,

1275
01:24:41,951 --> 01:24:45,038
- and that is pretty fucking good.
- Yeah, girl.

1276
01:24:45,371 --> 01:24:46,611
- Let's blow this joint.
- Yeah.

1277
01:24:46,664 --> 01:24:48,416
- Yes.
- Prom sucks.

1278
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:49,500
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

1279
01:24:49,542 --> 01:24:50,543
Yes.

1280
01:24:59,427 --> 01:25:01,030
Have you seen the video
that she's talking about?

1281
01:25:01,054 --> 01:25:03,056
- No.
- It, it's the best.

1282
01:25:03,139 --> 01:25:06,518
- ...your fucking phone. Asshole.
- Why were you looking at my phone?

1283
01:25:06,601 --> 01:25:07,961
You can't look in my phone.

1284
01:25:11,689 --> 01:25:12,816
Hey, remember me?

1285
01:25:14,442 --> 01:25:16,277
Hey, how's it go...

1286
01:25:17,278 --> 01:25:20,115
- Oh!
- Shit!

1287
01:25:20,198 --> 01:25:22,033
- Go fuck yourself.
- Fuck, yeah!

1288
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:23,785
That was awesome.

1289
01:25:23,868 --> 01:25:25,787
- Yeah. You can't fucking look...
- Fuck you.

1290
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:34,087
- Hey.
- Shit, sorry you had to see that.

1291
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:36,506
Everything okay?

1292
01:25:38,091 --> 01:25:42,637
Uhm, she's mad that I have a phone...

1293
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:44,597
I guess.

1294
01:25:46,766 --> 01:25:49,966
I don't know. She's fucking crazy, man.
I shouldn't have brought her, that was...

1295
01:25:50,478 --> 01:25:51,521
a bad idea.

1296
01:25:53,398 --> 01:25:56,609
I have been such a dick to you
and I, I'm really sorry.

1297
01:25:56,693 --> 01:25:58,987
I didn't mean to be. And I'm really sorry.

1298
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:02,740
Noah, I've been kind of dick-like, too.

1299
01:26:05,201 --> 01:26:07,745
- Dickishness forgiven?
- Yeah.

1300
01:26:08,872 --> 01:26:11,624
Great. Come on. Let's go.

1301
01:26:14,878 --> 01:26:17,213
- Yay!
- Yo, now the party's here.

1302
01:26:40,653 --> 01:26:41,988
Last ones to leave,

1303
01:26:42,488 --> 01:26:43,531
classy girls.

1304
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:45,658
Savoring every moment.

1305
01:26:47,076 --> 01:26:48,804
All right, ladies.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1306
01:26:48,828 --> 01:26:51,988
Oh, wait, wait, let me get a picture of you. - Oh, seriously?
- Yes.

1307
01:26:52,415 --> 01:26:53,684
- Yeah.
- So let's take pictures,

1308
01:26:53,708 --> 01:26:54,768
- Jesus Christ.
- Yeah, okay.

1309
01:26:54,792 --> 01:26:57,128
Oh, that's good. All right.
Freeze it, hold it.

1310
01:26:58,838 --> 01:27:00,381
She smashed brother's Donkey Bong?

1311
01:27:01,382 --> 01:27:02,425
Donkey Bong,

1312
01:27:03,009 --> 01:27:08,640
there with us through high school,
life, death, SATs, prom,

1313
01:27:09,557 --> 01:27:12,810
we only had a little bit of weed, but we
wanted to get, like, really, really high.

1314
01:27:13,353 --> 01:27:18,608
We bury you next to your brethren,
Jon Bong Jovi, Sean Bongery,

1315
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:22,946
Bong Connery, "Ceci n'est pas une pipe."

1316
01:27:26,366 --> 01:27:27,492
You will be missed.

1317
01:27:32,288 --> 01:27:33,331
Oh.

1318
01:27:40,672 --> 01:27:41,756
Now, what do we do?

1319
01:27:42,423 --> 01:27:47,929
Hmm, I have to finish my grad speech,
but I almost don't give a fuck.

1320
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:49,347
What do you have so far?

1321
01:27:50,431 --> 01:27:52,433
Mmm, I'm writing that on my phone.

1322
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:57,105
- Well, stand up. Do it for us.
- Yeah.

1323
01:27:57,563 --> 01:28:00,525
- Hmm?
- Lily, Lily.

1324
01:28:00,692 --> 01:28:04,862
Okay. I've tried to put a name
on what I'm feeling.

1325
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:08,908
It has to do with fear,
of the unknown, of change.

1326
01:28:10,451 --> 01:28:11,327
It's wrapped up in memory,

1327
01:28:11,411 --> 01:28:14,330
being in the places
that have contained your life.

1328
01:28:14,706 --> 01:28:16,541
It has the sense of too-soon nostalgia,

1329
01:28:16,624 --> 01:28:19,294
as if I deeply long
for what's right in front of me.

1330
01:28:19,419 --> 01:28:21,504
Then a friend said it, loss.

1331
01:28:22,463 --> 01:28:25,925
Is that what I'm feeling,
what it means to grow up?

1332
01:28:26,968 --> 01:28:28,303
Your growing familiarity

1333
01:28:28,386 --> 01:28:31,556
with an acceptance
of the pain of life's losses?

1334
01:28:32,265 --> 01:28:36,352
<i>Growing up is understanding
what eases that pain, friendship.</i>

1335
01:28:37,103 --> 01:28:39,981
<i>A bond fused by tears, traumas,</i>

1336
01:28:40,106 --> 01:28:43,609
<i>hours logged in the same cars,
in front of the same TVs.</i>

1337
01:28:44,652 --> 01:28:46,852
<i>All of our memories
are wrapped up in each other.</i>

1338
01:28:47,655 --> 01:28:49,949
<i>It's the greatest gift
this place has given us,</i>

1339
01:28:50,033 --> 01:28:51,784
<i>and it's part of our loss today.</i>

1340
01:28:52,702 --> 01:28:55,997
<i>But the poet, Robert Penn Warren
gave a better definition of loss,</i>

1341
01:28:56,414 --> 01:28:58,541
<i>what loss can be if we approach it right.</i>

1342
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:02,587
<i>"The process whereby
the pain of the past in its pastness</i>

1343
01:29:02,712 --> 01:29:05,548
<i>may be converted
into the future tense of joy."</i>

1344
01:29:13,556 --> 01:29:14,766
Mr. Bemis.

1345
01:29:15,892 --> 01:29:17,435
- Hi.
- Hey.

1346
01:29:19,562 --> 01:29:23,983
- Okay, uh, call me Immanuel.
- Immanuel? Really?

1347
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:26,527
- Hm-mmm.
- Uhm, thank you for the flowers.

1348
01:29:26,611 --> 01:29:27,779
I'm glad you came.

1349
01:29:30,031 --> 01:29:31,949
God, what am I gonna do without you?

1350
01:29:32,867 --> 01:29:36,579
- You're the reason I come to school.
- Me, too. For you.

1351
01:29:39,457 --> 01:29:40,792
Look, I know it's wrong.

1352
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:45,129
I'm 18, though.
Look, I just graduated, so...

1353
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:50,760
I'm, I'm 24, but I have
the emotional maturity of like a 20 or...

1354
01:29:50,843 --> 01:29:51,904
- Right. Right. Right.
- maximum.

1355
01:29:51,928 --> 01:29:53,721
- Come, come meet my mom.
- Wow, uh...

1356
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:58,976
I'm nervous. All right.
In the middle? Immanuel Bemis.

1357
01:30:03,981 --> 01:30:06,317
- Wait, wait, wait.
- I'm gonna get all of us.

1358
01:30:06,651 --> 01:30:09,570
- Amelia.
- Rosa.

1359
01:30:09,862 --> 01:30:13,366
Your brownies are so delicious,
everybody loves them.

1360
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:16,244
Where did you, where did you get this?

1361
01:30:17,161 --> 01:30:19,163
Damn, I love to chill, dude.

1362
01:30:19,789 --> 01:30:21,541
- Hi.
- Congratulations.

1363
01:30:21,624 --> 01:30:24,127
You killed your speech.
I was crying the whole time.

1364
01:30:24,210 --> 01:30:25,813
- Thank you.
- Thanks. Yeah. It was great.

1365
01:30:25,837 --> 01:30:28,023
- Are we still on for dinner tomorrow?
- Yeah, motherfucker.

1366
01:30:28,047 --> 01:30:31,092
My mom is currently basting
the brisket as we speak, so, yeah.

1367
01:30:31,175 --> 01:30:32,260
- Amazing.
- Great.

1368
01:30:32,385 --> 01:30:34,220
Lily, I wanna get a family photo.

1369
01:30:34,637 --> 01:30:37,098
Okay. Go photo. I'm gonna stay here
and to really eat

1370
01:30:37,181 --> 01:30:41,101
- every single one of these brownies. - Okay. - Hey, guys.
- Go. Okay, wait, here she comes.

1371
01:30:50,486 --> 01:30:52,422
- All right. Go. Go. Go. Get in there.
- You just literally ruin it.

1372
01:30:52,446 --> 01:30:53,656
- Do something.
- Whoa.

1373
01:30:53,906 --> 01:30:56,367
- I'm sorry.
- Do something, uhm, adorable.

1374
01:30:56,450 --> 01:30:58,119
The monkeys. The monkeys.

1375
01:30:58,703 --> 01:31:00,288
- Aw. Do it.
- The monkeys.

1376
01:31:00,746 --> 01:31:02,915
Oh, there it is. There it is.

1377
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:06,252
Good one. And we'll do that thing
where you guys hit a hundred times.

1378
01:31:06,335 --> 01:31:08,004
- And enough now. Come with me.
- Perfect.

1379
01:31:09,172 --> 01:31:10,482
- How are you doing?
- Little bro.

1380
01:31:10,506 --> 01:31:12,925
- How do you feel about everything?
- Free. I made it.

1381
01:31:13,426 --> 01:31:15,696
- And you're gonna miss the shit out of me.
- Do you feel all right about it?

1382
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:17,805
- Yeah.
- I'll be right back.

1383
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:25,313
What?

1384
01:31:26,189 --> 01:31:32,361
Rosa may have served the brownies
that I made for our private after party.

1385
01:31:32,445 --> 01:31:33,446
- What?
- What?

1386
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:35,323
Just look.

1387
01:31:36,157 --> 01:31:38,784
- But how much weed's in them?
- Like an ounce.

1388
01:31:38,868 --> 01:31:39,702
- An ounce?
- Fuck.

1389
01:31:39,785 --> 01:31:41,412
- Maybe like four ounces.
- Four ounces?

1390
01:31:41,495 --> 01:31:43,748
- I thought we deserve to get high.
- Oh my God.

1391
01:31:44,165 --> 01:31:49,503
Your heads are so huge
in a good way.

1392
01:31:50,671 --> 01:31:52,632
Okay. Thanks, Rosa.
