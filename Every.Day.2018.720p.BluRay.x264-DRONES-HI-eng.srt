NICK: Justin, let's go!

3
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,825
Justin. Hello, Justin.

4
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:31,376
Set an alarm for 11:00 p.m.
and set another alarm for 11:50 p.m.

5
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,298
Rhi, 6:30, hon.

6
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,184
- Rhi!
- I'm up!

7
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,604
Oh, my God.

8
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:42,444
- Hello.
- Hi.

9
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:43,573
Thanks, babe.

10
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,414
Hey, I need you to run
those errands today for me, please.

11
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,037
I don't really know about today.

12
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,331
Just try. Okay, Nick?

13
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,379
See you later.

14
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,214
Bye.

15
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,931
Jolene, breakfast. Come on.

16
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,928
- No.
- We're gonna be late.

17
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:19,906
God.
Um, I could also drive, if you want.

18
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,358
I mean, I could actually
use the practice.

19
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,572
Does that have spinach in it?

20
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,866
Yeah, Dad says spinach has antioxidants.

21
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,701
You know what else has antioxidants?

22
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,502
- Your balls. Yeah.
- My balls.

23
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,129
Well, Dad says it's important, so...

24
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,540
Hey!

25
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,592
What's going on up here, huh?

26
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,382
Dumbass.

27
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:56,935
Justin, my goon.

28
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,608
Yo, don't ignore me, bro.

29
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,316
Right, sorry. Hey, goon.

30
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:05,151
You okay?

31
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,577
Yeah, I'm good. All good.

(BELL RINGS)

33
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,705
I'm so tired.

34
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,077
I wanna drop Model UN,

35
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,376
but if I don't get into Stanford,
I will literally cry to death.

36
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:15,412
That campus is so beautiful.

37
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,918
And their mascot is,
not even joking, a tree.

38
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,799
- You're gonna apply with me, right?
- Yeah. For sure.

39
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,220
Where even is Justin?

40
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,593
I mean, what's up with him?

41
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,097
- He takes you totally for granted.
- I'll be right back.

42
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,314
Hey.

43
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,360
Look, I'm sorry for texting you so much.

44
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:41,403
I was gonna text you "Sorry"
again this morning

45
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,573
but I'd already texted you so much

46
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,570
and also, I know you don't like it
when I apologize

47
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,153
so I guess I'm sorry
for saying "I'm sorry."

48
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,237
Rhiannon.

49
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,741
- Yeah?
- Don't be sorry.

50
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,541
That was on me.
I should've written you back.

51
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:59,209
No, no, you don't have to text me
every time I text you.

52
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,045
I think I do.

53
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,259
Well, I can come watch your practice
if you want.

54
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:09,557
That doesn't sound that much fun
for you.

55
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,723
Why are you looking at me like that?

56
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:19,935
Like what?

57
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,571
What else do you have today?

58
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,736
Other than practice?

59
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,944
Nothing. No tests or anything.

60
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:34,703
Maybe it would be fun
if we just went somewhere?

61
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,576
Like, after school?

62
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,287
Or even now?

63
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,211
Is that something we do?

64
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:46,423
Well, couldn't it be?

"You have a nice smile."

Story checks out. Good job, cookie.

91
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,472
Bad job, cookie. It's not a fortune.

92
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,590
It's not?

93
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,143
No. A fortune would be,
"You will have a nice smile."

94
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,642
Because a fortune
is supposed to tell you the future.

95
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,432
Or something you don't already know.

96
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,688
Like that you have a nice smile.

97
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,025
Um, it's just Dad.

98
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,162
You don't talk about him.

99
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,457
Like, ever.

100
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,075
Um...

101
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:09,668
He had a manic episode a few years ago.

102
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:11,708
It's no big deal.

103
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:14,093
I had no idea.

104
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:19,515
Uh, yeah, I haven't really told anyone
about it.

105
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:20,891
Not even Rebecca.

106
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,515
You don't have to, obviously.

107
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,814
Sometimes I want to. It's just...

108
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,105
I don't know.

109
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,235
Well, what happened, exactly?

110
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:38,067
He came home one day
and told us he got a big promotion.

111
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,363
He took us out to some French restaurant
to celebrate.

112
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,282
And then we went to a movie.

113
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:49,085
And he paid the guy some crazy amount

114
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,334
so we could have
the whole theater to ourselves.

115
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,254
I'm guessing no promotion?

116
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,340
No. He had actually
just gotten laid off...

117
00:09:58,681 --> 00:09:59,671
And snapped.

118
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:01,716
So, no new rich life.

119
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,599
And my mom had to take a second job
and we almost lost our house.

120
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,815
And now even if he could work,
I don't know who would hire him.

121
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:13,485
He just sits around
and makes paintings of faces.

122
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:18,737
Sometimes people need a break.

123
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,952
Life gets too much.

124
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:27,916
It sounds like you resent him
for checking out, though.

125
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,714
I want to talk to him
about that day and why...

126
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,759
But I can never seem to figure out
what to say.

127
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,804
I don't know why
I'm telling you all this.

128
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,890
I'm glad you did.

129
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:54,564
It feels good.

130
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,710
It's your turn. Go.

131
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,495
Uh...

132
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,999
Yeah, I mean, I hate French food, too.

133
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,626
Snails and croissants.

134
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,969
Snail-croissants.
I mean, what's that about?

135
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,346
- I meant, open your cookie.
- Oh...

136
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:52,997
See you tomorrow.

137
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:56,380
What's wrong?

138
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,290
You know every day
won't be like this, right?

139
00:11:58,676 --> 00:11:59,837
I know.

140
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:02,921
But, maybe, it helps you remember
you like spending time with me?

141
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,013
Look, I just mean, today...

142
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:12,312
Today was the happiest day
I've had in a long time.

143
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,732
Tomorrow is tomorrow.

144
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,733
Let's end today on a nice note.

145
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,193
Okay.

146
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,247
That's the nice note.

147
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,792
Also, your mouth tastes so much better
when you don't smoke.

148
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,255
I'll try to remember that.

149
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:12,828
Set an alarm for 11:00 p.m.
and set another alarm for 11:50 p.m.

150
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,543
Hello, Amy.

151
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:31,634
Hey, what's going on?

152
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:37,606
Excuse me.
My family just moved here from D.C.

153
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:39,975
My mom told me to shadow someone
at the school today

154
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,651
but she didn't set anything up.

155
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,360
So embarrassing. Could I shadow you?

156
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:47,399
Um...

157
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,865
I don't know what that is, no.
What is that?

158
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,781
Yeah. Yeah. sure.

159
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:01,505
Rebecca, Alexander, this is Amy,
who might be coming here.

160
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:04,049
Hey, Amy. You've got a great person
to show you around.

161
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,339
Yeah, Alexander's a huge fan.

I did. I wanted a name that no one else
was likely to have, so...

And you're never that person again?

So, like, when you're somebody,
are you them or still you?

I'm me.

You know, my consciousness, my memories.

the more I know about them.

458

Who else have you told this?

459
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,449
I told you, no one else.

00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:54,740
That sounds really lonely.

461

But it isn't.

464
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:08,170
Because I've seen so much.

465
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,090
I know what makes each person different.

466
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,006
And what makes everyone the same,
you know?

with 50 different pairs of eyes.

But you never get to stay with anything
long enough to watch it grow.

470
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:29,608
It's true.

471
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,691
But I'd like to, though.

472
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,832
If I show you something,
will you promise to show no one else?

Check out my Instagram.

Of people I've been,
and the things that I've seen.

476
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:01,226
Of course, it's a risk.

every night before I go to bed

has the unique idea to prank me

See, he did something to my memory

504
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:41,838
so the whole night's kind of hazy.

Then...

508
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:52,936
I was in this unnaturally tiny house.

Then running for my life.

510
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:01,281
Apparently, that evening, I told my mom
that he needed to borrow a car

511
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,822
so I could go help some friends
write a musical about Jesus.

he used my phone
to access his Instagram account.

516

It was intense.

517
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:24,510
It was a record of all the other
teenagers that he's taken over.

Can I see?

519
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,347
He kicked me off and
changed the password

520

521

- From one of the photos.

No.

No, I wasn't possessed.

I think that's enough for today.

Like, his personality?

00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:07,616
You were?

640
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:13,585
Yeah, well, I mean, like, you know,
what was it like when you were younger

641
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:15,541
being you?

642
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:16,833
Um...

643
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:23,007
Best I could tell, I was born
somewhere in Phoenix, maybe.

644
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:27,686
But the family I was with, this one day,

645
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:30,310
they flew to Detroit for a wedding.

646
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:33,521
And I bounced around Michigan
for a while.

647
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,648
You couldn't get back to Arizona?

648
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:39,819
No. Like I told you,
I can't choose who I wake up in.

649
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:41,116
Right.

650
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:43,069
But I meant...

651
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:46,496
You know, what was it like for you?

652
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:49,582
Well...

653
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:54,626
I didn't figure out I was different
from other people until I was six or so.

654
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:58,675
What tipped me off was the way
people would talk about tomorrow.

655
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:01,595
<i>You know, the things we'd do,
the places we'd go.</i>

656
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,638
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

657
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,258
<i>As though we'd all be together.</i>

658
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:09,394
<i>Which I knew we wouldn't.</i>

659
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:13,357
<i>But anytime I tried to say that,
the people, they wouldn't understand.</i>

660
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:15,024
<i>They'd think it was a joke or a game.</i>

661
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:16,898
<i>Or else they'd get worried.</i>

662
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:20,568
After a while,
I just realized my tomorrows

663
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,775
are very different from everyone else's.

664
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:28,451
And you never found
anyone else like you?

665
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,373
No.

666
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:33,710
I mean, I search online,

667
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:35,874
message boards,

668
00:44:35,965 --> 00:44:38,548
people talking about being taken over.

669
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:41,714
There's a subreddit that's interesting.

670
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,045
(MAN SHUSHES)

671
00:44:43,973 --> 00:44:45,464
Should we get you some facts?

672
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,344
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay.

673
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:49,684
RHIANNON: Forty-seven, chicken.

674
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:53,185
A: Chicken gestates for 22 days.

675
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:54,893
Forty-eight, goat.

676
00:44:54,984 --> 00:45:00,196
Goat gestates for 136 to 160 days.

677
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:02,610
Forty-nine, groundhog.

678
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,909
Groundhog gestates for 31 to 32 days.

679
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:07,948
Fifty, kangaroo.

680
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:11,453
Kangaroo gestates for 32 to 39 days.

681
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:15,293
Wow. These are great.

682
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,086
They're really gonna unsettle his mom.

683
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:19,957
So, how'd I do?

684
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:24,336
- I don't know, I didn't check.
- You didn't check?

685
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:27,134
- I think I did all right.
- I think so, too.

686
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:29,015
Where's my reward?

687
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:32,768
GEORGE'S MOM: George.

688
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:37,229
What kind of a whore...

689
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:38,604
- She really does talk slow.
- Yeah.

690
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:40,310
- Seduces my son?
- Hey, just run.

691
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,986
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, run.

692
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,889
- (KNOCK AT DOOR)
- Rhi, 6:30.

693
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:21,276
Holy shit.

694
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:23,771
What is it?

695
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,488
Nothing.

696
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:39,540
I will be cool about this.

697
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,131
I promise.

698
00:46:47,096 --> 00:46:49,713
Nick, it's Walmart, not the Yukon.

699
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,423
I can't. Please?

700
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:56,352
Hey. Everything okay?

701
00:46:57,106 --> 00:46:59,564
Yeah. Just, have a good day at work.

702
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:02,692
Hey, wait.

703
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,608
Come here.

704
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:12,153
I need to go to D.C. on Sunday
with my team for a pitch.

705
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:14,704
We could squeeze in
a little sightseeing,

706
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,747
little shopping, if you wanna come?

707
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,413
I wanna come.

708
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,248
Good.

709
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,417
Okay, have a good day. I love you.

710
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,799
Be cool, be cool, be cool.

711
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:32,931
I'm sorry.

712
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:34,891
I didn't mean to look.

713
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:40,772
Dude, were you gonna wake me up?
We're gonna be late.

714
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,065
Sorry.

715
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:43,725
What the shit are you doing?

716
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:50,107
Siri, set an alarm for 11:00 p.m.

717
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:00,409
Your makeup looks different.

718
00:48:02,088 --> 00:48:03,249
It's good.

719
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:06,714
Breakfast?

720
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:08,042
Oh, my God.

721
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,752
I'm sorry, I completely forgot.

722
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,132
It's okay, I hate that shit.

723
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,181
Everything okay with you?

724
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:25,108
You just look really pretty today.

725
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:28,437
So do your balls.

726
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,330
All right, keep your panties on.

727
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,024
Hey.

728
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,488
You're lookin' sexy today.

729
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,069
Oh.

730
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,247
I mean, you know, more than usual.

731
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:22,703
Well, thanks.

732
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:25,206
Thank you for lookin' so sexy.

733
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:29,498
So, do you wanna get out of here,
and go back to my place?

734
00:49:30,176 --> 00:49:31,542
Maybe not today.

735
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:33,877
I thought you like when we do that.

736
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:38,590
You have no idea what I like, do you?

737
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:40,634
Excuse me?

738
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:45,138
I like leaving with you if you're
going to give me a special day.

739
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:48,976
If you're going to give me a day
of fooling around in your gross room

740
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:51,937
watching you play video games,
and maybe getting McDonald's for lunch,

741
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:53,897
that does not qualify as special.

742
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:55,649
Qualifies as awesome, though.

743
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:56,984
No, it doesn't.

744
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,535
We've had one awesome day
in, like, months.

745
00:49:59,622 --> 00:50:01,363
I'm sick of hearing about this day.

746
00:50:01,457 --> 00:50:03,699
Is that because you don't remember it,
because you weren't really there?

747
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:10,380
Do me a favor
and don't talk to me again today.

748
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:14,300
Are you on your period already?
It's been, like, a week and a half.

749
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:16,594
Well, then, congratulations,
you're not a father.

750
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:24,894
I'm sorry.

751
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:26,847
I lost control.

752
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:31,063
Please, please don't be mad
at me tomorrow.

753
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:49,794
NICK: Everything okay?

754
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:52,080
Mmm-hmm.

755
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:56,967
Thanks.

756
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:04,385
Dad, why do you paint?

757
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:06,603
You never ask about my work.

758
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:12,850
Uh...

759
00:51:14,113 --> 00:51:17,572
I think when I started doing insurance

760
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:19,987
and gave up on painting

761
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:24,655
that maybe I bottled up things
that I shouldn't have.

762
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:28,833
All those years, doing something
that wasn't me.

763
00:51:30,963 --> 00:51:32,329
Took its toll?

764
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,336
Yeah.

765
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:42,555
So, why faces?

766
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:46,759
Well...

767
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:51,728
I suppose it's like,
"Write what you know."

768
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:53,816
Paint what you see.

769
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:58,321
In my mind's eye...

770
00:51:59,408 --> 00:52:00,569
This is what I see.

771
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,197
Some face of someone I don't know.

772
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:07,534
They're just there.

773
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:11,960
I wanna give 'em
the space to exist, live...

774
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,166
Be.

775
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:19,209
I could use a fresh face.

776
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:22,846
Wanna sit for me?

777
00:52:24,892 --> 00:52:26,099
Yeah.

778
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:27,471
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

779
00:52:27,603 --> 00:52:28,593
Okay.

780
00:52:30,439 --> 00:52:31,805
A: <i>So, I was you yesterday.</i>

781
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:34,232
<i>And I tried to leave you every memory.</i>

782
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:38,646
<i>I tried to change things for you
as little as possible.</i>

783
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:40,943
<i>Although, I did do
a week of your homework.</i>

784
00:52:41,033 --> 00:52:42,524
<i>And I'm amazing at homework.</i>

785
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:45,902
<i>No need to thank me.
Okay, fine, you're welcome.</i>

786
00:52:47,456 --> 00:52:49,914
<i>I need you to know
that I didn't choose to be you.</i>

787
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:52,751
<i>I wouldn't choose that, even if I could.</i>

788
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:55,162
<i>And in all of my years,</i>

789
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:58,464
<i>I've never woken up in the body
of someone I care so much about.</i>

790
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:03,587
<i>It was the best and most terrifying day
of my life so far.</i>

791
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,556
<i>You are the only reason why.</i>

792
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:11,143
<i>Yours, A.</i>

793
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:43,668
- Hey.
- Hey, babe, what are you doing here?

794
00:53:44,138 --> 00:53:45,674
I think we need to take a break.

795
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:51,559
But this stuff between us is great,
our connection.

796
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:53,056
It's really not.

797
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:55,855
You don't see me.

798
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:58,024
- MAN: I can see you.
- You have no idea who I am.

799
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:05,073
Have a nice life.

01:06:23,855 --> 01:06:25,141
I got your message.

957
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:26,513
Wow.

958
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:29,771
<i>Yeah. I knew she had some dark thoughts.</i>

959
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:32,482
<i>Maybe an hour ago I decided to draw</i>

960
01:06:32,572 --> 01:06:33,983
<i>something cheerful
in one of her notebooks.</i>

961
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:35,359
<i>Make her feel better.</i>

962
01:06:35,867 --> 01:06:37,733
<i>That's where she had it written down.</i>

963
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:45,203
A: She's got it all planned out.

964
01:06:50,298 --> 01:06:53,791
If her dad finds her pills, she's gonna
drive into the side of an overpass.

965
01:06:58,014 --> 01:06:59,425
RHIANNON: When does her dad come home?

966
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:01,924
He doesn't leave the hospital
until 5:00 a.m.

967
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:04,017
He's in surgery until then.

968
01:07:07,607 --> 01:07:09,394
You've got to stop her.

969
01:07:09,484 --> 01:07:10,600
There's nothing I can do.

970
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:11,854
You don't believe that.

971
01:07:13,238 --> 01:07:15,696
Call her father. Call a counselor.

972
01:07:16,491 --> 01:07:17,982
It's Kelsea's life, not mine.

973
01:07:18,076 --> 01:07:20,784
So, if she were gonna kill someone,
what would you do then?

974
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:22,741
- I'd turn her in.
- Right.

975
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:24,913
So how is this different?

976
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:27,746
It's not fair of me to do something
that makes up her mind for her.

977
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:31,002
So you never, ever get involved

978
01:07:31,089 --> 01:07:32,705
in the lives of the people
you're inhabiting?

979
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:33,872
I can't.

980
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:36,626
What about Justin?
What made that so different?

981
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:38,919
You.

982
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:45,301
If you leave her at midnight,
she's going to go through with it.

983
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:48,270
So, you're just gonna have to
try and stay.

984
01:07:55,697 --> 01:07:57,484
I believe you can do it.

985
01:07:58,575 --> 01:08:00,612
And I need you to believe it, too.

986
01:08:02,412 --> 01:08:03,402
How?

987
01:08:07,292 --> 01:08:08,499
Push back.

988
01:08:12,297 --> 01:08:13,629
Stay with me?

989
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:42,774
Honey?

990
01:08:43,328 --> 01:08:45,069
You need to get me help, Dad.

991
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:50,867
I've been thinking about it
for a long time.

995
01:09:31,042 --> 01:09:32,453
You feeling okay?

996
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:37,584
Jo said you told her something
kinda strange.

997
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:41,379
About meeting someone
who's in a different body every day?

998
01:09:41,552 --> 01:09:42,793
It was a joke.

999
01:09:43,346 --> 01:09:44,427
All right.

1000
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:47,760
Hey.

01:09:50,144 --> 01:09:51,476
I love you, Rhi.

1002
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:55,272
If you ever need to talk,
I'm always here.

1003
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,270
Dad?

1004
01:10:05,326 --> 01:10:06,692
Do you still love Mom?

1005
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:08,868
Of course, I do, sweetheart.

1006
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:15,997
I don't think we can know what it's like
when you're in love with someone...

1007
01:10:18,798 --> 01:10:20,164
And they change.

Hey, what's up, slut?

1009

Hey, don't shame the slut.
Rhi, I'm proud of you.

1010
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:35,387
Stay slutty.

Shut up, dumbass.

1012

- Hi.
- Hi.

1013
01:10:44,699 --> 01:10:46,235
I really missed you yesterday.

1014
01:10:47,702 --> 01:10:49,614
I'm sorry about those guys.
It's my fault.

1015
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:53,243
It's nothing. So tell me everything.

1016
01:10:58,629 --> 01:11:00,461
She's got more appointments tomorrow.

1017
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:05,714
Doctors, maybe an overnight stay.
Probably she goes on medication.

1018
01:11:07,054 --> 01:11:10,468
I hope it turns out okay.
I mean, I think it could...

1019
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:13,050
But it's her life, so...

1020
01:11:13,478 --> 01:11:16,846
It is. And you saved it.

1021
01:11:18,149 --> 01:11:19,310
You stayed.

1022
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:21,858
I stayed.

1023
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:26,526
So that means you can
stay in someone else, maybe?

1024
01:11:28,993 --> 01:11:30,575
Maybe I could.

1025
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:32,869
What are you doing tonight?

1026
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:36,202
Date.

01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:38,078
Not with you.

1028
01:11:39,045 --> 01:11:40,707
With her boyfriend.
It's their anniversary.

1029
01:11:41,088 --> 01:11:42,670
I probably shouldn't miss it.

1030
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:45,457
Well, maybe tomorrow then.

1031
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:54,299
Can I kiss you?

1032
01:11:57,104 --> 01:11:58,094
Yeah.

01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:11,858
Hi.

1034
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:17,244
What are you doing up so late?
I thought you had a test tomorrow.

1035
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:23,040
Mom, I know you and Dad
are trying to make it work.

1036
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:31,466
But every day you can grow
a little bit closer to each other

1037
01:12:31,556 --> 01:12:35,175
or you can grow
a little bit farther apart.

1038
01:12:37,103 --> 01:12:38,139
Okay.

1039
01:12:39,272 --> 01:12:40,262
Um...

1040
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:45,226
Look, I know Dad is not who he was.

1041
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:49,195
But you're not who you were, either.

1042
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:52,573
Because we all change.

1043
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:58,573
And you've changed, too.

1044
01:13:01,335 --> 01:13:02,496
So...

1045
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:05,128
Please, just grow closer.

1046
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:23,952
He's amazing, Rhiannon.

1047
01:14:24,835 --> 01:14:28,704
He's curious and kind, and handsome.

1048
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:33,459
It's funny, I've known him for so long,
but I don't know much about him.

1049
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:35,134
He's so shy at school.

1050
01:14:35,221 --> 01:14:37,463
Yeah, he's not the kinda kid
that's built for high school.

1051
01:14:38,683 --> 01:14:40,015
He's built for what comes next.

1052
01:14:41,352 --> 01:14:44,220
He remembers
beautiful things beautifully.

1053
01:14:45,106 --> 01:14:46,597
He reads and he sees.

1054
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:48,603
And he listens
with every part of himself.

1055
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:52,269
He sees what's funny in people
without ever being cruel.

1056

Excuse me, I'll take this guy
if you don't want him. Who is he?

01:14:56,659 --> 01:14:58,275
Oh, he's talking about himself.

You did it with Kelsea.

With Kelsea it was easier,
I think, 'cause...

I guess she didn't wanna
be here anymore.

01:20:53,599 --> 01:20:55,682
Well, good, because I'm not really sure

1116
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:57,851
I would give you one
that would make any sense.

1117

Are you and Alexander a thing now?

1118
01:21:01,732 --> 01:21:03,724
Uh, yeah.

1119
01:21:04,318 --> 01:21:05,775
I always thought you should be together.

1120
01:21:06,612 --> 01:21:07,898
You did?

1121
01:21:08,113 --> 01:21:09,103
Yeah.

1122
01:21:10,908 --> 01:21:12,399
I'm glad you're happy, Rhi.

1123
01:21:13,369 --> 01:21:15,361

01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:43,721
Wow.

1126
01:21:43,941 --> 01:21:45,648
What is this, the Last Supper?

1127
01:21:46,485 --> 01:21:48,067
More like a first date.

1128
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:51,529
Turns out, he's a really great cook.

1129
01:21:52,282 --> 01:21:53,818
He's a really great guy.

1130
01:21:54,284 --> 01:21:55,866
Okay. I know.

1131
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:58,153
So are you.

1132
01:21:58,247 --> 01:22:02,241
I mean, really great. I've never had
your cooking, so I can't speak to that.

1133
01:22:03,419 --> 01:22:08,289
Rhiannon, he's got a family
that loves him, and that he loves.

1134
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:11,173
It's everything I've ever wanted.

1135
01:22:12,386 --> 01:22:14,878
Yeah. It's been nice.

1136
01:22:16,223 --> 01:22:17,555
But it's not mine.

1137
01:22:20,102 --> 01:22:23,140
I'm forcing Alexander
out of his own life, and it's wrong.

1138
01:22:24,565 --> 01:22:26,522
And the longer I stay,
the more I'm damaging him.

1139
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:29,021
We'll go back to how it was.

1140

Do you know Flynn in my algebra class?

1141

You cannot, under any circumstance,
be him.

If that's who you wake up in,
then don't even call me.

1143
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:46,580
I mean, it can be Flynn.
It's not a deal-breaker.

1144
01:22:48,547 --> 01:22:50,334
I can't do it to anybody.

1145
01:22:54,303 --> 01:22:56,169
Not to Alexander, not to Flynn.

1146
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:00,222
- Not to you.
- What are you saying?

1147
01:23:02,186 --> 01:23:04,473
I've been thinking about this over
and over and over.

1148

I'm always going to be blocking you

1149

from being with someone
who's perfect for you.

1150

How could you say that?

1151
01:23:16,283 --> 01:23:18,775
Because Alexander's perfect for you.

1152
01:23:20,329 --> 01:23:22,446
- He's your type.
- You're my type.

1153
01:23:24,625 --> 01:23:26,787
Do you think I wanna live without you?

1154
01:23:28,587 --> 01:23:30,954
Do you think I'll ever be happy
in a place you're not?

1155
01:23:33,217 --> 01:23:35,254
Go back to a life that you're not in,

1156
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:38,178
back to seeing only faces
that aren't yours?

Hearing only voices that aren't yours?

1158
01:23:43,727 --> 01:23:45,309
You should be with him.

1159
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:51,933
He's tall, slim, nice shoulders.

1160
01:23:58,075 --> 01:23:59,691
He's really smart.

1161
01:24:01,411 --> 01:24:05,246
He's incredibly kind, he's interesting,
and thoughtful on so many levels.

No. We can make it work, A.

I wanna believe that.

You know I wanna believe that.

1165

Think about what happens

<i>What if we want a kid?</i>

1179

that kid almost entirely alone</i>

<i>Is that gonna be my kid?</i>

the day after she's born?

Will my kid ever know her parents?
