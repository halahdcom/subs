1
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:40,785
Bobby?

2
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,863
Mom

3
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,352
Mom?

4
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:50,438
Bobby?

5
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:54,400
Don’t.

6
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,240
Richard?

7
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,536
-Don’t open the door, Kristen.

8
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:13,253
I love them, like I love you.

9
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,927
I really wish…

10
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,557
…that I could bring them back.

11
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,396
I could have…

12
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,108
but I couldn’t…

13
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:37,944
help myself.

14
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:43,992
And I tried this time. I really did try.

15
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,830
This doesn’t work.

16
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:57,046
-And I wish that it did.
-Uh, no.

17
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:00,508
You should go before it’s too late.

18
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,802
-Go!

19
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:22,864
I’m sorry.

20
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,181
I’ve roared through my family,

21
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,308
so they don’t want me around no more.

22
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,979
My friends,
they don’t want me around no more.

23
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:59,942
Shit, there are times
when I don’t want me around no more.

24
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,738
I’ve lived in alleyways,

25
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:06,657
under bridges, and then…

26
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:11,079
I found this… this cool park…

27
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,667
so big that I can get lost in it
when I want to.

28
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,880
Then one day,

29
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,926
I saw these weirdos walking
into the building across the street.

30
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,056
I saw it through this tunnel,

31
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,683
like it was magical and shit.

32
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,896
I wanted to know
what was going on in there,

33
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,564
and if there was any food…

34
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,401
or maybe drugs.

35
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,990
So, here I am.

36
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,579
I wasn’t expecting any of this.

37
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:58,501
But, um, maybe this is some of that
“act of God” type shit,

38
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,213
that I found this place
and all of you people…

39
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,925
and all that food over there.

40
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,888
My name is Eddie, and I’m an addict.

41
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:12,849
-Thank you.
-Thanks, Eddie.

42
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,860
My name is Ellie, and I’m an addict.

43
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,403
-Welcome, Ellie.
-Hi, Ellie.

44
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,326
Sorry, I’ve, um…

45
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:39,000
It’s hard doing this all over again
in a new place.

46
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,793
It’s okay.

47
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,089
It’s just that I just moved here.

48
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,137
So here goes. Um…

49
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,851
It started with one drink.

50
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:03,149
And then that one went into another,
and then a whole hell of a lot more.

51
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:11,824
I was an addict, but I thought,

52
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:15,620
“It’s no big deal. Everyone is, kind of.”

53
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:19,916
But, um…

54
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,669
I thought, “This is…

55
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,507
I can handle this. This is easy.”

56
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,722
But then I… I hurt my back.

57
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:38,226
And they gave me these pills,

58
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,937
these goddamn pills.

59
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:45,399
And they took the edge off
like nothing else.

60
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:52,031
Sorry, I know I’m not supposed to say
what drug, sorry.

61
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:59,205
But they took the life out of life,
which was exactly what I wanted.

62
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,168
And…

63
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,004
my husband left me…

64
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,426
which, to be honest,
wasn’t such a bad thing.

65
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,392
But I lost my kids.

66
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,649
And, uh…

67
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,986
at first, I didn’t really care,

68
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:33,197
because I wanted the pills
more than I wanted them.

69
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,703
I can’t believe I’m saying that right now.

70
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,585
Anyway, I got my kids back.

71
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,546
And we have a new home…

72
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,301
and hopefully some new friends.

73
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:50,232
My Lola don’t like the smell of smoke
inside the house.

74
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,363
-We just moved here.
-I heard all the noise.

75
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,282
There’s been a lot around here lately.

76
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:01,744
Screws, nails, sharp edges.

77
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,789
And they say they’re trying
to make this neighborhood safer.

78
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,750
-Okay.
-I’m not leaving.

79
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:09,794
You’re not buying me out.

80
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,589
We’re just renting.

81
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:25,643
We just moved into our new house.
It’s huge.

82
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:27,269
Yeah.

83
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,232
It’s not in the best of neighborhoods.
Little sketchy.

84
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:36,987
Um, I just wanted to tell you
thank you so much for this opportunity.

85
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,949
I… I couldn’t… No, I really couldn’t
have done it without you.

86
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,700
I really appreciate it.

87
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,454
Yeah, the kids are doing well.

88
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,136
Up. Come on. Hurry.

89
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:06,600
Amy.

90
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,103
Amy.

91
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,606
Come on. There could be a fire.

92
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,276
There’s no fire.
It’s just my stupid brother.

93
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,008
I called your mother.

94
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,262
This has been
a pretty eventful first few days, Kyle.

95
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,181
You got into a fight…

96
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:47,766
defaced school property,

97
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,102
and then another fight.

98
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:56,150
-I didn’t tag the bulletin board.

99
00:12:57,109 --> 00:13:00,529
In order to stay here,
you have to want to be here.

100
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,908
-I don’t wanna be here.
-Well, you won’t be.

101
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:05,743
Not this week.

102
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,953
Wait outside for your mother.

103
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,215
Meegan, get in here.

104
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,929
Meegan.

105
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:08,889
You get suspended?

106
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,059
Yeah. Yeah.

107
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,688
-He’s an asshole.
-Yeah.

108
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,147
He’s a huge asshole.

109
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,275
The second fight wasn’t really a fight.

110
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:22,361
It was just you getting the shit
beat out of you type of thing.

111
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,029
Yeah.

112
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,199
What’d you do?

113
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,660
Tagged a bulletin board.

114
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,664
What?

115
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:36,500
I like your work.

116
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,224
Can I see?

117
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,728
Ah, come on. You saw my work.

118
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:05,946
Wow.

119
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,491
“Wow” like they suck “wow,” or “wow” what?

120
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:14,496
“Wow” like you might be
a serial killer, Kyle.

121
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:19,543
In a good way.

122
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,867
Mom

123
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:58,582
Mom?

124
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,501
Kyle?

125
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,220
Mom

126
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:07,067
Have you talked to Dad yet?
He’s gonna be so pissed.

127
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:13,240
I tried to call a few times
since we’ve gotten here,

128
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,117
but he hasn’t answered.

129
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,869
He’s traveling.

130
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:19,246
-He’s always traveling.
-For work.

131
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:22,750
Okay.

132
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,503
Why haven’t you unpacked yet?

133
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,467
You know,
you can at least try cheering up a bit.

134
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,720
Kyle, you’re being a child.

135
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,854
Can you just get the hell out of my room?

136
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:26,772
Kyle.

137
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:35,823
Don’t.

138
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,331
Look, I know
you don’t ever want to listen to me,

139
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,458
and I know I don’t deserve
to say anything to you,

140
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:50,295
but please don’t screw up your life
because you’re mad at me.

141
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:51,797
Please?

142
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,637
I promise this time it’ll be different.

143
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,058
You say that every time.

144
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,734
Hey.

145
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,197
-I’m going for a run.
-You don’t have to call it that.

146
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:00,741
I know.

147
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:11,001
Why do you always go for a run so late?

148
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:14,087
-It’s not that late.
-Kyle said it’s a bad neighborhood.

149
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,175
It’s not bad.

150
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:24,681
Maybe it once was,
but it’s being gentrified, which means…

151
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,808
I know what it means.

152
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,519
Rich white people move in
and kick everyone else out.

153
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,399
You’re my little girl.

154
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:39,279
Mom, I’m 13.
I’m gonna be 14 in two months.

155
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,949
I know, I know. Don’t remind me.

156
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,178
So, first off,

157
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,682
is there anyone
who’s at their first meeting

158
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,226
or from out of town?

159
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,519
Uh, yeah.

160
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:16,191
I don’t know whether to sit or stand,
but they always stand in the movies, so…

161
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,735
You can do
whatever makes you feel comfortable.

162
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:19,820
Thanks. Um…

163
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,325
I’m Christopher,
and I’m not sure what I am.

164
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,494
-Welcome, Christopher.
-Hello, Christopher.

165
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,706
Thank you for being so welcoming.

166
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,377
Yeah, I guess I am an addict. I just…

167
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:38,672
I never thought about it that way.

168
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:41,967
And I’ve…

169
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:47,389
I’ve just torn through so many people…

170
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,184
and I can’t stop myself.

171
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,855
So I guess that is an addiction.

172
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,192
And I need help.

173
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,528
I don’t want to be alone anymore.

174
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:05,615
-Thanks, Christopher.
-Thanks, Christopher.

175
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:15,208
-My name is Ellie, and I’m an addict.
-Hi, Ellie.

176
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,047
<i>I got a new job.</i>

177
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:25,177
<i>My friend, she’s a tenured professor.</i>

178
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,638
<i>She’s my age, and she got me it.</i>

179
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,435
<i>But sometimes it’s a little hard, because…</i>

180
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,897
-<i>I should be where she is right now.</i>

181
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:43,070
<i>But anyway, I’m not supposed to be</i>
<i>thinking about stuff like that, right? So…</i>

182
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,822
<i>Uh…</i>

183
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:50,035
<i>Shit, I’m really trying, but…</i>
<i>I swear to God, I’m trying.</i>

184
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,746
<i>My name’s Ellie, and I’m an addict.</i>

185
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:54,623
-<i>Thanks, Ellie.</i>
-<i>Thanks, Ellie.</i>

186
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:43,839
Hey.

187
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:46,716
Eddie. You weren’t at the meeting.

188
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:48,510
Are you okay

189
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,726
Okay, well, uh…

190
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,939
I’ll see you at the next meeting, okay?

191
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,280
-You take care of yourself.

192
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:10,198
What?

193
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:14,828
In there. You said that you do pills.

194
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:17,998
I…

195
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,002
I said I used to.

196
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,214
Fuck you.

197
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,636
This is better
than your suburban housewife shit.

198
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,239
-Ohh!

199
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,633
Come on, Mom. Time to go.

200
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,844
-Mom.

201
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:09,474
I’m up. I’m up, baby.
Just go get ready for school.

202
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:11,184
I am ready to go to school.

203
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:15,021
What happened to your head?

204
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,525
I, uh…

205
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,077
I…

206
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,163
I tripped while walking to the car.

207
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,331
Can I see?

208
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,295
Okay, well,
it’s not as bad as it looks, right?

209
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,092
-I don’t see anything.

210
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,307
I guess I didn’t hurt myself
as bad as I thought.

211
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,688
-It was dark.
-Okay.

212
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,573
I used to watch this with my mom.

213
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:19,312
Admit to God, ourselves,
and others our wrongs.

214
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:22,440
Ready for God to remove
defects of character.

215
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,610
Ask him to remove our shortcomings.

216
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:30,239
Made a list of harmed
and willing to make amends.

217
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,867
Then make amends.

218
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,578
Be accountable and admit when wrong.

219
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:39,874
Pray for the knowledge of his will
and the power to carry it out.

220
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,128
Then be awakened through these steps,

221
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:47,632
and practice them
throughout everything in our lives.

222
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,812
My name is Ellie, and I’m an addict.

223
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:02,480
-Hello.
-Hi, Ellie.

224
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,860
I don’t deserve this.

225
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,327
Careful. Mug’s hot.

226
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:22,625
Anything else?

227
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:27,964
No, we’re good. Thanks.

228
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:34,721
Thanks for getting coffee with me.

229
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,347
I…

230
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:39,225
I don’t think I’m the best person
to talk to about this.

231
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,188
You might be the only person
to talk to about this.

232
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:47,400
I don’t know,
I just needed somebody to talk to whose…

233
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:51,237
life is only slightly less screwed up
than mine.

234
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:55,992
I’m sorry.

235
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:01,289
-No, that’s okay.
-I mean, I don’t know.

236
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,666
I probably wouldn’t have
believed you otherwise.

237
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,925
Well, the program works…

238
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:15,762
and people fall.

239
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:22,060
But you just keep getting up again.

240
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:25,271
Sometimes you just wish
that there was one thing in the world

241
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:28,149
that you didn’t have to put
all of your effort into controlling.

242
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,777
And that would make all the difference.

243
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:34,072
-I hope you find it.

244
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,157
That one thing.

245
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,035
Cheers to that, right?

246
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,294
You all right?

247
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:56,094
-Oh, my gosh. I’m so sorry.
-No, don’t be sorry.

248
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:59,263
-No, I’m fine.

249
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:26,374
-It’s not the pills, baby.

250
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,180
Did you find anything?

251
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,559
Just go get ready for school.

252
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,450
You know, you didn’t find any pills.

253
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:45,411
-So maybe that means…
-She can get them from anywhere, Amy.

254
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:49,665
So, what

255
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:55,463
Look, Amy,
I’m not going through this shit again.

256
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:01,177
You know what I like about your sketches?

257
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:08,601
They make me feel like I’m at home…

258
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,357
no matter where we live.

259
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:32,792
Ahh.

260
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,721
You didn’t come to the meeting.
I got worried.

261
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:45,025
I know what you’re going through.

262
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:54,577
No, you don’t understand.
I know exactly what you’re going through.

263
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:59,331
When I saw you on that swing in the park,
you looked so peaceful…

264
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:02,376
but troubled.

265
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:05,463
I just wanted to protect you.

266
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:11,510
I made sure that no one can ever hurt you.

267
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:17,933
How?

268
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:21,020
Because I turned you
into whatever it is that I am.

269
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:47,171
It gets easier,
but you don’t want to do it alone.

270
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:57,348
Do you want to invite me inside
so we can talk about this?

271
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:59,391
I want you to leave me alone.

272
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,119
It’s too late.

273
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:44,306
She’s so screwed up
she can’t say anything about it.

274
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:49,978
You ever thought that maybe
it was something else other than drugs?

275
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:51,146
Like what?

276
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:59,780
I would take the el
and come here with my mom.

277
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:01,740
She was the art history teacher
at the college,

278
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:06,495
so whenever she got done with class,
she’d come find me, and she’d get me out.

279
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:12,501
And we’d sit here and look at it,
try to figure it out.

280
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:17,714
Well, you know
it says right next to it, right?

281
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:20,384
We never read it. It felt like cheating.

282
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:23,554
Well, you know, a little help never hurts.

283
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:31,103
She never told us she was sick.

284
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,565
I guess she thought
she could handle it on her own

285
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:36,400
without worrying us about it.

286
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:41,029
And I-I knew. I knew something was wrong.

287
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:45,659
I would ask her
if she wanted to talk about it.

288
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:52,166
And we’d just sit here,

289
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,877
talking about this instead.

290
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,422
You know, and…

291
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:02,551
I wish I pushed her
till she told me what it was.

292
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:10,893
And by the time she told us,

293
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,270
it was too late.

294
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:22,529
Just do yourself a favor
and talk to her while you still can.

295
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:38,754
-No.

296
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:41,298
I want to keep guessing
until you tell me I’m right,

297
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:43,717
no matter how many times
we have to come back here.

298
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:54,394
God grant me the serenity

299
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:57,189
to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can,

300
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:02,736
and wisdom to tell the difference.

301
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:06,573
Accepting hardships
as the pathway to peace,

302
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,909
living one day at a time,

303
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,411
enjoying one moment at a time.

304
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:12,996
Amen.

305
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:12,949
Mom?

306
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:52,072
Mom?

307
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:08,004
Uhh!

308
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:33,029
Mom?

309
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:07,189
-I heard something.

310
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:08,857
-I don’t know.

311
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:11,359
Go to your room.

312
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:13,570
Mom?

313
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:16,531
Mom?

314
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:38,512
Mom.

315
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:41,765
Uh, wha…

316
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:43,975
I’m fine. I just…

317
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:47,479
I just need a moment to myself, okay?

318
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:49,731
Let me help you.

319
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:54,027
No, just, I’m fine, all right?
Just-Just leave me alone for a bit.

320
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:56,947
I don’t need your help.

321
00:51:57,030 --> 00:52:00,033
Mom, I’m not going anywhere
until you tell me what’s wrong.

322
00:52:00,116 --> 00:52:01,535
You can’t help me!

323
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:36,338
Mom

324
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:39,299
Mom!

325
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:53,188
Get in the car.

326
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:55,523
-To Dad’s.

327
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:44,489
What do you want?

328
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:47,283
Have you seen Lola?

329
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:48,743
She hasn’t come back all night.

330
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:51,079
-She always comes back.
-No, I haven’t.

331
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:54,541
Can I check your basement?

332
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:58,545
Lola.

333
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:07,762
Lola.

334
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:12,851
Lola. Lola, where are you?

335
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:17,230
Lola.

336
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:21,443
Come on, baby. Come on. Come on, sugar.

337
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:28,783
Lola.

338
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:34,873
Eleanor?

339
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:39,252
What the hell’s wrong with you?

340
00:55:41,337 --> 00:55:42,172
A lot.

341
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:44,549
Are you feeling all right?

342
00:55:57,937 --> 00:56:00,940
I told you he’s not home.
 He isn’t traveling.

343
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:04,694
He just says that because
he doesn’t want to deal with the shit.

344
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,905
So we’re part of “the shit”?

345
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,579
She’s never gonna get better, is she?

346
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:26,633
It’s Dad.

347
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:28,468
Told you.

348
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:31,304
At least Mom wants us.

349
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:39,145
I’m going back.

350
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:15,056
Mom.

351
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:25,275
Mom.

352
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,709
-Go upstairs.

353
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:43,668
Now!

354
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:08,568
Turn it off, Kyle.

355
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,032
Please. I don’t want you to see.

356
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:16,117
-Just turn it off!

357
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:22,207
Mom, why did you kill her?

358
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:25,960
For her blood.

359
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:31,966
Someone turned me into this.

360
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:33,885
Who?

361
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:37,222
I don’t know what he was.

362
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:41,601
You should leave right now.

363
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:43,853
That knife’s not gonna help you.

364
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:49,025
Just call the police. Do whatever it is
you need to do, but do it now.

365
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:51,945
Go!

366
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:11,107
Did you kill anyone else?

367
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:14,319
Did you call the police yet?

368
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:18,114
Not yet.

369
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:23,828
Maybe you should.

370
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:24,138
-Yeah. I’m a friend of your mother’s…

371
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:26,933
from her meetings. Christopher.

372
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:36,234
Look, now’s not really a good time.

373
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:39,445
Is everything all right?
 You can let him in.

374
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:42,865
He’s the one, Kyle.

375
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:48,496
If you let me inside,
we can talk about this.

376
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,248
-You’re a…
-Shh.

377
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:53,960
No. Don’t say it. It’s made up anyway.

378
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:55,712
Are you gonna let me inside?

379
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:01,676
-You can only come in if I invite you in.
-No, I was just being polite.

380
01:02:05,012 --> 01:02:06,514
-Easy.
-Let him go!

381
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:11,102
Why would you do this to her?

382
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:13,438
Because I care about her, Kyle.

383
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,273
Is it curable?

384
01:02:17,608 --> 01:02:19,360
-No.

385
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:24,615
It’s just like any other addiction.
It’s manageable.

386
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:28,369
But this part will pass.

387
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:32,874
God! Just go!

388
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:35,126
-Kyle…
-Leave!

389
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:37,920
No, it’s okay. It’s all right.

390
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:53,538
Hello?

391
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:10,096
Hello?

392
01:05:41,228 --> 01:05:42,229
Sit down, Kyle.

393
01:05:48,569 --> 01:05:49,445
Okay.

394
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:00,915
“Ten Ways to Kill a Vampire.” That’s cute.

395
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,876
No. No.

396
01:06:04,877 --> 01:06:08,005
Yes, but no. No.

397
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:17,890
Your mother wants me to stay.

398
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:23,270
That was on the list, by the way.

399
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:39,161
It’s all gonna be okay.

400
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:16,490
You stayed.

401
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:00,076
She’s sleeping, Kyle.

402
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:01,327
She’s tired.

403
01:08:02,661 --> 01:08:03,662
We all are.

404
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:07,041
The daylight is just another myth.

405
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:09,335
Just give her some time.

406
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:12,129
She’ll seem more normal…

407
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:15,883
maybe even better than before.

408
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:23,015
You know those pills…

409
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:26,268
that tore apart your family?

410
01:08:27,812 --> 01:08:29,605
She’ll never use them again.

411
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:32,399
She can’t.

412
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:48,833
You know, I saw that gargoyle
in your sketchbook.

413
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:51,335
Did you know that people

414
01:08:51,418 --> 01:08:54,672
put gargoyles above their entrances
to keep out the evil?

415
01:08:57,007 --> 01:08:59,301
What first appears as a monster…

416
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:03,722
is only there to keep you safe.

417
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:18,404
There’s a lot of bad in the world.

418
01:09:22,867 --> 01:09:25,286
I’m talking about real evil.

419
01:09:37,882 --> 01:09:38,757
Kyle?

420
01:09:43,929 --> 01:09:46,891
For future reference, Kyle, the knife…

421
01:09:49,143 --> 01:09:50,227
doesn’t work.

422
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:13,209
Kyle.

423
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:17,546
-I don’t have time to talk right now.

424
01:10:18,255 --> 01:10:20,549
What happened?
-Don’t worry about me.

425
01:10:20,633 --> 01:10:22,718
-I have to go.

426
01:10:22,801 --> 01:10:24,803
I’m sorry, okay? It was bad advice.

427
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:25,888
I have to go.

428
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:47,493
Mom?

429
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:23,362
Mama?

430
01:11:24,905 --> 01:11:26,031
Hey, baby.

431
01:11:26,865 --> 01:11:28,367
What are you doing here? I’ve come to take you home.

432
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:37,126
Does Dad know you’re here?

433
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:00,733
Amy?

434
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:14,913
Garlic.

435
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:33,807
I’m gonna be right outside the door.

436
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:58,874
<i>Hi, you’ve reached Tom.</i>
<i>We can’t come to the phone right now.</i>

437
01:12:58,957 --> 01:13:00,751
<i>Leave a message. I’ll call you back.</i>

438
01:13:21,438 --> 01:13:22,314
Amy.

439
01:13:24,274 --> 01:13:26,693
Don’t open this door,
no matter what you hear, okay?

440
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:30,364
Amy.  Okay.

441
01:14:34,761 --> 01:14:36,346
Stay away from my son.

442
01:14:46,773 --> 01:14:48,984
Kyle, leave us alone.

443
01:14:50,944 --> 01:14:51,778
Kyle.

444
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:56,074
Christopher and I need to talk.
Please leave us alone.

445
01:15:01,413 --> 01:15:02,414
Close the door.

446
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:13,217
It doesn’t get easier.

447
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:21,850
No. It doesn’t.

448
01:15:26,021 --> 01:15:27,397
But at least we’re together.

449
01:16:26,665 --> 01:16:27,833
A stake works.

450
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:40,173
Where’s Kyle?

451
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:44,761
Kyle!

452
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:52,811
Mom.

453
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:56,523
Kyle

454
01:18:57,691 --> 01:18:59,901
Meegan, go.

455
01:19:01,069 --> 01:19:02,237
Kyle.

456
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:04,448
Mom, please.

457
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:08,702
Mom.

458
01:19:09,453 --> 01:19:11,621
Please don’t hurt her. Please. Stop.

459
01:19:12,789 --> 01:19:14,124
Stop!

460
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:21,089
Please. No!

461
01:19:47,282 --> 01:19:50,619
I can save her, but she’ll,
she’ll be like me.

462
01:19:57,334 --> 01:19:58,376
What do you want me to do?

463
01:20:16,061 --> 01:20:17,354
No one should be like this.

464
01:20:22,442 --> 01:20:23,568
Mom?

465
01:20:24,444 --> 01:20:25,779
I called the police.

466
01:21:04,484 --> 01:21:06,736
Let’s go. Let’s go. Go.

467
01:21:10,615 --> 01:21:11,825
Go to the basement.

468
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:13,869
Kyle, go!

469
01:21:13,952 --> 01:21:17,080
-Go to the basement. I said go.
-Go. Go. Go.

470
01:21:21,042 --> 01:21:21,960
Please.

471
01:21:22,961 --> 01:21:23,962
Don’t leave me.

472
01:21:27,173 --> 01:21:28,383
You’re my little girl.

473
01:21:34,347 --> 01:21:35,515
Kyle.

474
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:39,352
Please just get in the basement. Please.

475
01:21:39,936 --> 01:21:40,937
Get in the basement.

476
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:45,609
Go.

477
01:21:58,330 --> 01:21:59,331
We have blood.

478
01:22:03,501 --> 01:22:05,211
-I’ll check downstairs.
-Got it.

479
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:13,011
-Kyle.
-Go. Come on.

480
01:22:16,139 --> 01:22:18,141
I don’t think I can fit. What do I do?

481
01:22:18,224 --> 01:22:20,143
-Amy, push.
-I’m trying.

482
01:22:23,438 --> 01:22:24,689
Kyle.

483
01:22:29,861 --> 01:22:31,404
Hey, we got blood up here.

484
01:22:34,366 --> 01:22:36,910
-No bodies.
-Shit.

485
01:22:40,121 --> 01:22:41,206
I’m gonna radio dispatch.

486
01:22:44,834 --> 01:22:46,127
Amy, run.

487
01:22:49,839 --> 01:22:52,133
Kyle, I don’t want to leave you.

488
01:22:54,177 --> 01:22:56,680
Go. Amy, run.

489
01:22:57,180 --> 01:22:58,348
Run, Amy!

490
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:41,016
Where’s Amy?

491
01:23:43,518 --> 01:23:44,519
She’s gone.

492
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:49,315
Maybe you should go too.

493
01:24:03,997 --> 01:24:04,831
No.

494
01:24:07,959 --> 01:24:08,835
No.

495
01:24:11,421 --> 01:24:13,548
I think I’m gonna… I think I’m gonna stay.

496
01:24:14,591 --> 01:24:15,759
Here, with you.

497
01:24:21,973 --> 01:24:22,974
No matter what. I love you.

498
01:24:36,446 --> 01:24:39,365
-I love you.
-I love you too.

499
01:24:47,791 --> 01:24:48,625
Mom.

500
01:24:50,376 --> 01:24:51,836
Please let go of me.

501
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:54,964
Let… Mom?

502
01:25:00,595 --> 01:25:01,721
-No.
-Amy.

503
01:25:03,014 --> 01:25:04,599
No, no, no, no.

504
01:25:05,934 --> 01:25:06,935
Oh, my God.

505
01:25:24,369 --> 01:25:25,370
Do it, Kyle!

506
01:25:35,505 --> 01:25:37,340
Here. Here. Have it.

507
01:25:39,884 --> 01:25:41,553
-No, no.
-Mom.

508
01:25:44,597 --> 01:25:45,431
Stop!

509
01:25:50,812 --> 01:25:52,772
Oh, my God, Kyle. Kyle.

510
01:25:54,065 --> 01:25:55,984
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

511
01:25:57,944 --> 01:26:01,239
No. Please. Don’t go away too.

512
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:03,825
Oh, my God.

513
01:26:08,705 --> 01:26:11,791
-Let me help.
-No! Just go away!

514
01:26:11,875 --> 01:26:13,251
Just leave!

515
01:26:17,964 --> 01:26:22,218
Please don’t leave me.
Please. Kyle, I need you.

516
01:26:23,052 --> 01:26:23,970
Please stay.

517
01:26:39,402 --> 01:26:40,236
No.

518
01:26:58,254 --> 01:26:59,756
<i>I hit rock bottom.</i>

519
01:27:00,632 --> 01:27:02,717
<i>I thought I hit it many times, but…</i>

520
01:27:04,344 --> 01:27:06,179
<i>then when I finally did, I knew.</i> <i>’Cause all I had to do was look up…</i>

521
01:27:10,892 --> 01:27:12,227
<i>from the hole I dug.</i>

522
01:27:14,979 --> 01:27:19,484
<i>And I could barely see my kids from there.</i>
<i>They were so small.</i>

523
01:27:25,657 --> 01:27:28,910
<i>And now with every day that goes by,</i>
<i>they’re getting bigger and bigger.</i>

524
01:27:29,994 --> 01:27:30,995
<i>And I just…</i>

525
01:27:31,663 --> 01:27:34,415
<i>I hope that one day I can bring</i>
<i>our family back together again.</i>

526
01:27:37,835 --> 01:27:39,629
<i>My name is Christine, and I’m an addict.</i>
