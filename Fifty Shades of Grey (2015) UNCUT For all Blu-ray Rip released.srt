00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:35,422
<i>Ana, take my car.</i>

3
00:02:37,675 --> 00:02:39,438
I gave you the recorder right?

4
00:02:40,723 --> 00:02:42,999
- Oh, yes.
- And you have all the questions?

5
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:45,590
- Yes.
- And you know where you're going?

6
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:49,224
Yes, I do have a GPS, and a four point GPA.

7
00:02:49,413 --> 00:02:51,893
- I can figure it out.
- You're wearing that?

8
00:02:53,604 --> 00:02:58,304
Okay, a little less talking, more eating.

9
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,274
Miss Kavanagh?

10
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,602
- May I take your coat?
- Oh, yes

11
00:03:52,563 --> 00:03:54,705
Ella... Ella... Okay.

12
00:03:54,894 --> 00:03:57,550
- Mr Grey will see you now.
- Okay.

13
00:03:58,234 --> 00:04:00,337
- This way please.
- Okay.

14
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:02,719
<i>Mr Grey is in a conference at 11:15.</i>

15
00:04:11,369 --> 00:04:12,511
Right this way.

16
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:24,749
Miss Kavanagh, are you alright?

17
00:04:28,252 --> 00:04:31,273
- Christian Grey.
- I'm Anastasia Steele.

18
00:04:32,821 --> 00:04:36,018
Miss Kavanagh has the flu, so she asked me to fill in.

19
00:04:36,053 --> 00:04:38,977
I see, so you're studying journalism as well?

20
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:44,090
No. English literature Kate's my roommate.

21
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,324
As I said, I only have 10 minutes.

22
00:04:46,441 --> 00:04:48,169
Please, have a seat Miss Steele.

23
00:05:14,652 --> 00:05:15,947
Thanks.

24
00:05:20,331 --> 00:05:23,349
- Ready?
- Whenever you are.

25
00:05:23,538 --> 00:05:24,730
Okay.

26
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,403
So this is for the special graduation issue

27
00:05:28,592 --> 00:05:29,752
of the student newspaper.

28
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:31,177
Yes I'm giving the commencement address

29
00:05:31,178 --> 00:05:32,698
at this year's ceremony.

30
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:33,924
You are?

31
00:05:35,738 --> 00:05:39,658
I mean um… I know.

32
00:05:43,202 --> 00:05:46,340
You are very young to have amassed an empire.

33
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:48,694
- To what do you owe--
- To what do I owe my success?

34
00:05:50,031 --> 00:05:52,547
- Yep.
- Seriously?

35
00:05:52,736 --> 00:05:53,912
Yes.

36
00:05:56,818 --> 00:06:01,193
Business is about people, and
I've always been good at people.

37
00:06:01,882 --> 00:06:05,641
What motivates them, what inspires them.

38
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,521
Well maybe you're just lucky

39
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:15,553
I've always seen, the more hard eye
work, the more luck I seem to have.

40
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,847
The key to my success is
identifying talents in individuals.

41
00:06:20,136 --> 00:06:24,109
- And harnessing their efforts.
- You're a control freak?

42
00:06:24,298 --> 00:06:26,833
Oh I exercise control in all things Miss Steele.

43
00:06:30,837 --> 00:06:35,870
Okay um, your company is involved primarily

44
00:06:35,894 --> 00:06:37,830
in the telecommunications sector.

45
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:41,927
Yet you also invest in numerous agricultural projects.

46
00:06:42,116 --> 00:06:46,069
Including several in Africa.
Is that something you feel passionate about?

47
00:06:46,258 --> 00:06:47,920
Feeding the world's poor?

48
00:06:48,109 --> 00:06:49,501
Its smart business.

49
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,099
You don't agree?

50
00:06:55,286 --> 00:06:56,840
I don't know enough about it.

51
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:08,086
I just wonder, if you're heart might be
a bit bigger than you want to let on?

52
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,371
But some people say I don't have a heart.

53
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,504
- Why would they say that?
- Because they know me well.

54
00:07:18,334 --> 00:07:19,334
Continue.

55
00:07:22,004 --> 00:07:24,228
Do you have any interests outside of work?

56
00:07:24,906 --> 00:07:26,924
I enjoy various physical pursuits.

57
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:32,357
You're unmarried, oh you were adopted at age four.

58
00:07:32,446 --> 00:07:33,944
That's a matter of public record.

59
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:37,189
I'm sorry I didn't...

60
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,723
Do you have an actual question, Miss Steele?

61
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,768
Yes.

62
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:45,865
Are you gay?

63
00:07:52,088 --> 00:07:53,812
Its written here, I'm just...

64
00:07:55,206 --> 00:07:58,398
No, Anastasia.
I'm not gay.

65
00:07:59,568 --> 00:08:02,589
I apologise, Mr Grey Kate can be a little--

66
00:08:02,778 --> 00:08:06,966
- Intrusive?
- Curious.

67
00:08:12,675 --> 00:08:13,834
What about you?

68
00:08:17,086 --> 00:08:19,665
Why don't you ask me something you wanna know?

69
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:27,760
Earlier you said that there are some
people who know you well.

70
00:08:31,331 --> 00:08:33,510
Why do I have the feeling that that is not true?

71
00:08:36,981 --> 00:08:39,064
Mr Grey, your next meeting is in the conference room.

72
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,027
Cancel it please, we're not finished here.

73
00:08:41,155 --> 00:08:42,248
Yes sir.

74
00:08:42,437 --> 00:08:45,184
No I um… I can go.

75
00:08:45,273 --> 00:08:47,233
- Its fine.
- I would like to know more about you.

76
00:08:50,481 --> 00:08:52,516
There's not really much to know about me.

77
00:08:52,705 --> 00:08:58,238
You said you're in English literature?
Tell me was it Charlotte Brontë, Jane Austen

78
00:08:58,327 --> 00:09:01,074
or Thomas Hardy, who made you fall in love
with literature?

79
00:09:03,907 --> 00:09:04,907
Hardy.

80
00:09:07,584 --> 00:09:09,211
I would've guessed Jane Austen.

81
00:09:11,814 --> 00:09:13,894
What are your plans for after you graduate?

82
00:09:13,902 --> 00:09:16,091
I'm just trying to get through my finals.

83
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,954
- And then?
- Then I was planning on moving here

84
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,158
to Seattle with Kate.

85
00:09:22,347 --> 00:09:24,585
We offer an excellent internship program

86
00:09:27,354 --> 00:09:29,461
I don't think I'd fit in here.

87
00:09:34,706 --> 00:09:38,994
- Look at me.
- I am.

88
00:09:43,812 --> 00:09:44,859
<i>Mr Grey's office</i>

89
00:09:44,894 --> 00:09:46,495
I hope you got everything you needed

90
00:09:47,011 --> 00:09:49,678
I think you only answered four questions.

91
00:09:57,193 --> 00:09:59,930
- Anastasia.
- Christian.

92
00:10:10,227 --> 00:10:11,550
Holy cow.

93
00:10:29,322 --> 00:10:31,998
- Before you say anything--
- You're a goddess, this is perfect.

94
00:10:32,187 --> 00:10:32,812
What?

95
00:10:32,836 --> 00:10:35,436
I just got his email, he answered every question.

96
00:10:36,697 --> 00:10:38,765
So? What was he like?

97
00:10:42,007 --> 00:10:47,866
- He was fine.
- Fine? Just fine?

98
00:10:49,099 --> 00:10:57,099
He was very polite, and courteous, very formal and clean.

99
00:11:02,072 --> 00:11:03,386
Clean?

100
00:11:05,773 --> 00:11:08,903
I mean, he was you know, smart.

101
00:11:09,062 --> 00:11:13,656
And intense, kind of intimidating.

102
00:11:15,483 --> 00:11:18,226
- I can understand the fascination.
- Uh huh!

103
00:11:19,517 --> 00:11:23,139
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- Like what?

104
00:11:23,328 --> 00:11:24,525
Okay.

105
00:11:26,743 --> 00:11:28,423
I'm gonna make a sandwich, you want one?

106
00:11:28,457 --> 00:11:29,457
No, thanks.

107
00:11:35,338 --> 00:11:37,649
You have to admit, he's ridiculously hot.

108
00:11:37,838 --> 00:11:45,838
I'm sure if you're attracted to that sort of human.

109
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,350
The hot type of human?

110
00:11:49,939 --> 00:11:53,729
I asked him if he was gay.
It was in your questions.

111
00:11:53,883 --> 00:11:54,883
Why would you do that to me?

112
00:11:54,905 --> 00:11:57,396
Because whenever he's in the society pages.

113
00:11:57,585 --> 00:11:59,789
He's never been photographed with a woman So naturally.

114
00:11:59,978 --> 00:12:02,458
Well maybe he just wants to keep
his private life private Kate.

115
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:07,041
- And now you're defending him.
- I'm ending this conversation.

116
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,331
Too bad we don't have any original photos of your

117
00:12:11,411 --> 00:12:13,871
hot, clean, 27 year old billionaire.

118
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,423
The camera loves him as much as you do.

119
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,693
Okay I wasn't hungry, but now I am.

120
00:12:21,243 --> 00:12:24,591
Thank you.

121
00:13:07,068 --> 00:13:09,758
- Ana, I've been looking for you.
- Whats up?

122
00:13:09,947 --> 00:13:11,077
- Guess what?
- What?

123
00:13:11,266 --> 00:13:15,006
Portland's place is going to exhibit
my photographs next month.

124
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:16,195
Oh my god!

125
00:13:16,782 --> 00:13:19,822
Congratulations, that's so good!

126
00:13:19,911 --> 00:13:22,349
- It feels so good.
- Can we celebrate later?

127
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:25,184
- Cause I'm really late for work.
- Yeah, yeah, you got it, you got it.

128
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:30,297
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Thank you, you're my hero.

129
00:13:30,486 --> 00:13:32,428
- See you later.
- Okay.

130
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:42,509
Mom I'm at work can I call you back?

131
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:44,373
<i>No wait I called for a reason.</i>

132
00:13:44,405 --> 00:13:47,741
<i>Bob broke his foot playing golf of all things.</i>

133
00:13:47,776 --> 00:13:49,899
Christ is he okay?
In a lot of pain?

134
00:13:49,934 --> 00:13:52,519
Who knows? The man called the paramedics
because of a blister.

135
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:56,499
<i>It means though, we won't
be able to fly in for graduation.</i>

136
00:13:58,049 --> 00:14:03,321
Really? You could just come alone,
you don't have to bring Bob.

137
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,868
Least I could do to fend for himself.

138
00:14:06,257 --> 00:14:10,106
- You understand don't you darling?
- Yeah, yeah its fine.

139
00:14:11,763 --> 00:14:14,304
- I really have to go, okay?
- I love you Ana.

140
00:14:14,493 --> 00:14:15,919
I know I love you too.

141
00:14:17,115 --> 00:14:18,198
God.

142
00:14:18,414 --> 00:14:23,726
- Ana-- can you give me a hand out back?
- Uh yeah yeah, I'll be right there.

143
00:14:34,222 --> 00:14:36,346
- Thought it was you.
- What the fuck?

144
00:14:36,535 --> 00:14:38,729
What a pleasant surprise Miss Steele.

145
00:14:39,418 --> 00:14:44,100
It's Ana, just Ana.
You're in here...

146
00:14:44,135 --> 00:14:47,949
I was in the area on business,
needed to pick up a few things.

147
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:53,665
- Are you free?
- Yeah… What can I help you with?

148
00:14:54,154 --> 00:14:55,697
Do you stock cable ties?

149
00:14:55,708 --> 00:15:00,386
Cable ties, yes we do, I can show you if you want.

150
00:15:00,975 --> 00:15:04,373
- Please, lead the way Miss Steele.
- Its Ana.

151
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,373
- That it?
- Masking tape.

152
00:15:13,489 --> 00:15:15,717
- Are you redecorating?
- No.

153
00:15:17,312 --> 00:15:22,531
We have one inch and two inch, but the truly self

154
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:25,195
respecting handyman would have both in his tool box.

155
00:15:25,684 --> 00:15:26,822
Of course he will.

156
00:15:27,011 --> 00:15:29,331
It's rare to find a connoisseur these days...

157
00:15:31,146 --> 00:15:36,077
- Did you want anything else?
- Yes, rope.

158
00:15:40,181 --> 00:15:42,840
That's very impressive.
Do you girl scouts?

159
00:15:45,873 --> 00:15:49,917
No, organized activity groups aren't really my thing.

160
00:15:50,801 --> 00:15:56,175
- So what is your thing?
- I don't know… Books?

161
00:15:58,521 --> 00:16:05,548
Okay, rope, tape, cable ties
You're like a complete serial killer.

162
00:16:06,137 --> 00:16:09,260
- Not today.
- Anything else?

163
00:16:09,849 --> 00:16:13,637
- What would you recommend?
- For a do-it-yourself er?

164
00:16:14,991 --> 00:16:17,704
Maybe coveralls, to protect all your clothes?

165
00:16:18,835 --> 00:16:24,502
- Or I could just take all my clothes off.
- Okay, no clothes

166
00:16:24,691 --> 00:16:30,291
I mean, no coveralls I can't think of anything else.

167
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:34,775
- I guess that must be it.
- Cool.

168
00:16:35,989 --> 00:16:39,049
Thank you for answering Kate's questions by the way.

169
00:16:39,138 --> 00:16:41,225
- She was thrilled.
- I hope she's feeling better.

170
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:45,283
Yeah she is, she's just having trouble
finding an original photo of you.

171
00:16:45,318 --> 00:16:47,533
If she'd like an original, I'm around tomorrow.

172
00:16:47,722 --> 00:16:50,976
- You'd be willing to do that?
- Yeah.

173
00:16:51,165 --> 00:16:55,005
- Do you want me to bag for you Ana?
- No, I'm good, thanks though Paul.

174
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:58,289
Okay.

175
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,981
I'm staying at the Heathman.
Call me before 10.

176
00:17:09,649 --> 00:17:13,680
- About the photos.
- Oh, yeah, I will.

177
00:17:16,315 --> 00:17:17,788
Enjoy your...

178
00:17:37,871 --> 00:17:39,786
Thanks for doing this again Mr Grey.

179
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:43,963
- I'm happy to help.
- How about we try a few with a smile?

180
00:17:49,088 --> 00:17:50,313
Or not.

181
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:53,279
You do realise he hasn't stopped looking at you?

182
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,739
He asked me to go for coffee afterwards.

183
00:17:57,928 --> 00:17:58,928
What?

184
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,038
Kate shh…

185
00:18:02,671 --> 00:18:04,171
Is he your boyfriend?

186
00:18:05,449 --> 00:18:07,268
- Who?
- The photographer.

187
00:18:08,482 --> 00:18:13,040
- Jose? No.
- I've seen the way he was smiling at you.

188
00:18:14,571 --> 00:18:17,654
No Jose is more like family.
He's not my boyfriend.

189
00:18:18,043 --> 00:18:23,037
- And the guy at the store?
- Paul? No.

190
00:18:31,222 --> 00:18:32,472
Thank you.

191
00:18:41,297 --> 00:18:45,199
- You seem nervous.
- I find you intimidating.

192
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,828
You should.

193
00:18:50,215 --> 00:18:53,401
- Eat.
- Not to mention high-handed.

194
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:56,883
I'm used to getting my own way.

195
00:18:56,918 --> 00:18:58,225
Then you must get very boring.

196
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:06,288
- Tell me about your family.
- My family? Okay.

197
00:19:06,477 --> 00:19:09,145
My dad died when I was a baby.

198
00:19:09,169 --> 00:19:11,816
So I was raised by my step-father Ray.

199
00:19:13,077 --> 00:19:15,808
- He's amazing.
- And your mom?

200
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:24,624
My mother is on husband number four.
She's an incurable romantic.

201
00:19:25,746 --> 00:19:28,069
- And you?
- Am I romantic?

202
00:19:29,537 --> 00:19:33,655
Well I study English Literature.
I kind of have to be.

203
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:40,460
But the photo shoot went well right?
Kate seems to be really happy.

204
00:19:40,495 --> 00:19:43,770
- I'm sorry, I can't.
- What?

205
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:45,203
I'll walk you out.

206
00:19:51,182 --> 00:19:54,516
- Do you have a girlfriend, is that it?
- I don't do the girlfriend thing.

207
00:19:55,185 --> 00:19:56,705
- What does that even mean?
- Watch it!

208
00:20:09,225 --> 00:20:13,872
I'm not the man for you.
You should steer clear of me.

209
00:20:16,869 --> 00:20:18,458
I have to let you go.

210
00:20:22,344 --> 00:20:24,148
Goodbye Mr Grey.

211
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,181
Alright pencils down.

212
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:34,035
Please take your final exams to the back of the classroom.

213
00:20:34,824 --> 00:20:37,305
Final grades will be posted in two weeks.

214
00:20:37,494 --> 00:20:42,070
- Hey, you all good?
- Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

215
00:20:42,459 --> 00:20:45,600
- We are so partying tonight.
- Oh my god.

216
00:20:46,452 --> 00:20:47,568
This is way too much.

217
00:20:47,603 --> 00:20:50,432
No, we're getting exactly the right amount.

218
00:20:50,467 --> 00:20:52,739
- All over my face?
- That's the idea.

219
00:20:54,244 --> 00:20:57,560
- Wow, no Kate.
- Cab's early, lets go.

220
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:01,924
Ana, there's a package for you.

221
00:21:04,103 --> 00:21:08,242
<i>"Why didn't you tell me there was danger?
Why didn't you warn me?</i>

222
00:21:08,431 --> 00:21:10,668
<i>"Ladies know what to guard against</i>

223
00:21:10,857 --> 00:21:13,417
<i>"... because they read novels
that tells them of these tricks ".</i>

224
00:21:13,448 --> 00:21:15,645
That's a quote from Tess of the d'Urberville.

225
00:21:16,706 --> 00:21:17,943
Oh my god.

226
00:21:17,978 --> 00:21:19,741
These must be from Christian.

227
00:21:22,384 --> 00:21:23,964
I mean…

228
00:21:25,394 --> 00:21:27,021
These are incredible.

229
00:21:27,721 --> 00:21:28,816
Wow, Grey.

230
00:21:30,033 --> 00:21:35,923
Kate these are first editions I can't, this is too much.

231
00:21:36,984 --> 00:21:39,020
I can't accept them, I have to send them back.

232
00:21:40,022 --> 00:21:42,766
That's the cab, okay, are you ready?

233
00:21:43,888 --> 00:21:45,963
- Are you really though?
- Yes, yes, very.

234
00:21:45,998 --> 00:21:47,160
Lets get outta here.

235
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,746
Shots! Shots! Shots!

236
00:21:52,036 --> 00:21:53,718
No holding back here girl.

237
00:21:56,043 --> 00:21:58,158
- Did you do it all?
- Alright!

238
00:21:58,347 --> 00:22:01,431
With my right eye closed and left handed,
I can get this in.

239
00:22:01,466 --> 00:22:02,466
- What?
- I gotta pee.

240
00:22:02,542 --> 00:22:03,932
- Okay.
- One, two...

241
00:22:04,121 --> 00:22:06,116
- Where you going?
- I gotta go pee.

242
00:22:44,717 --> 00:22:47,305
- Anastasia.
- Yep, this is me.

243
00:22:48,108 --> 00:22:52,186
Sending back your expensive books, cause
I already have hard copies of that,

244
00:22:52,221 --> 00:22:54,842
Thanks though, for the kind gesture.

245
00:22:55,231 --> 00:22:57,636
You're welcome.
Where are you?

246
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,311
Oh… I'm in line, cause I have to pee really bad.

247
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:07,570
- Anastasia have you been drinking?
- Yeah, I have… Mr Fancy Pants.

248
00:23:07,979 --> 00:23:10,120
You hit the nail on the head.

249
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,251
<i>I mean the head right on the nail.</i>

250
00:23:12,275 --> 00:23:15,288
Listen to me, I want you to go home right now.

251
00:23:15,323 --> 00:23:16,406
<i>You're so bossy.</i>

252
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:20,952
"Ana, lets go for coffee"
"Ana, lets go for coffee."

253
00:23:20,976 --> 00:23:25,564
"No stay away from me Ana, I don't want you.
Get away."

254
00:23:25,588 --> 00:23:27,849
"Come here, come here."
"Go away."

255
00:23:27,928 --> 00:23:28,669
That's it.

256
00:23:28,693 --> 00:23:32,000
- Tell me where you are.
- I'm a long way from Seattle.

257
00:23:32,024 --> 00:23:35,033
- Long way from you.
- Which bar, whats it called?

258
00:23:35,057 --> 00:23:37,548
- I don't know, I gotta go.
- Which bar Ana?

259
00:23:41,123 --> 00:23:43,256
I told him right?

260
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,022
I'm sorry I didn't mean...

261
00:23:53,047 --> 00:23:54,391
Stay where you are, I'm coming to get you.

262
00:23:54,415 --> 00:23:58,533
What? Hello?

263
00:24:12,732 --> 00:24:16,301
- Hey.
- Oh thanks.

264
00:24:16,725 --> 00:24:18,018
Are you okay?

265
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:24,136
Yes, I just feel a little more drunk than...

266
00:24:25,014 --> 00:24:29,525
- Come here stay warm.
- Oh that's cool, I'm good Jose.

267
00:24:30,413 --> 00:24:34,146
No, I wanna have the courage to do this.

268
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,232
Do what?

269
00:24:35,256 --> 00:24:38,207
- Ana, I like you.
- You do?

270
00:24:38,567 --> 00:24:39,791
- Very much.
- Oh my god.

271
00:24:40,015 --> 00:24:43,716
- No, no, no.
- Please, one kiss.

272
00:24:44,564 --> 00:24:48,121
No, no, no José, I'm sorry, no.

273
00:24:48,475 --> 00:24:51,619
- Dude, she said no.
- Christian?

274
00:24:56,499 --> 00:24:58,095
- Don't look at me.
- Here.

275
00:25:02,691 --> 00:25:07,199
Nice touch, I will launder this item.

276
00:25:07,523 --> 00:25:09,610
- Lets get you home.
- I'm with kate.

277
00:25:09,834 --> 00:25:12,914
- I'll have Elliot tell her.
- Who's Elliot?

278
00:25:12,938 --> 00:25:15,219
He's my brother, he's inside talking to her right now.

279
00:25:15,443 --> 00:25:18,359
- I, I don't...
- He's at my hotel with me.

280
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:24,340
- You're still at the Heathman?
- Yes. Come.

281
00:25:40,671 --> 00:25:43,325
- That's your brother?
- Not by choice, lets go.

282
00:25:43,349 --> 00:25:45,100
Wait what did Kate say?

283
00:25:45,889 --> 00:25:47,865
She warned me to be on my best behaviour.

284
00:25:48,189 --> 00:25:50,655
- More like threatened me.
- She threatened you?

285
00:25:55,035 --> 00:25:58,581
You're spinning.
I think I'm gonna faint.

286
00:25:58,605 --> 00:25:59,614
What now?

287
00:26:31,775 --> 00:26:34,524
<i>Eat me, drink me.</i>

288
00:26:52,099 --> 00:26:53,731
Good morning Anastasia.

289
00:26:57,333 --> 00:27:02,061
- How you feeling?
- Better than I deserve.

290
00:27:07,978 --> 00:27:09,559
Did you put me to bed?

291
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:17,429
- You undressed me?
- I didn't have much choice.

292
00:27:18,806 --> 00:27:20,065
Where did you sleep?

293
00:27:25,249 --> 00:27:29,252
- Dear god… We didn't...
- Necrophillia's not my thing.

294
00:27:30,277 --> 00:27:34,261
- So we just slept then?
- It was a novelty for me too.

295
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:43,070
You-- need to eat.
I had Taylor pick you up some clothes.

296
00:27:43,987 --> 00:27:45,957
- Who's Taylor?
- My driver.

297
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:50,269
- Thanks, but you didn't have to do that.
- Yes I did.

298
00:27:50,593 --> 00:27:52,225
Yours were covered in vomit.

299
00:27:54,908 --> 00:27:56,452
You shouldn't have drunk like that.

300
00:27:56,487 --> 00:27:58,328
I'm all for testing the limits but

301
00:27:58,425 --> 00:28:01,812
- ...you put yourself at risk last night.
- I know.

302
00:28:06,508 --> 00:28:08,924
If you were mine you wouldn't
be able to sit down for a week.

303
00:28:09,751 --> 00:28:10,962
What?

304
00:28:14,403 --> 00:28:15,942
I gotta go take a shower.

305
00:28:23,871 --> 00:28:25,738
Why am I here Christian?

306
00:28:29,622 --> 00:28:32,421
You're here because I'm incapable of leaving you alone.

307
00:28:35,789 --> 00:28:36,789
Then don't.

308
00:28:41,962 --> 00:28:46,427
- Why'd you send me those books?
- I thought I owed you an apology.

309
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:52,307
- For what?
- For letting you believe that I...

310
00:28:56,218 --> 00:29:01,544
Listen to me.
I don't do romance.

311
00:29:05,182 --> 00:29:11,613
My tastes are very-- singular.
You wouldn't understand.

312
00:29:19,755 --> 00:29:21,536
Enlighten me then.

313
00:29:58,821 --> 00:30:03,730
- You look beautiful.
- Taylor has good taste.

314
00:30:07,365 --> 00:30:11,744
- What are you doing here later?
- I'm working at the hardware store till 7.

315
00:30:12,365 --> 00:30:14,115
I'll have Taylor pick you up then.

316
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:21,068
I'd like to bite that lip.

317
00:30:23,187 --> 00:30:24,926
I think I'd like that.

318
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:29,693
I'm not gonna touch you, not
until I have your written consent.

319
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:31,916
What?

320
00:30:32,343 --> 00:30:35,010
I'll explain later.
Come I'll take you home.

321
00:30:48,362 --> 00:30:50,083
Fuck the paperwork.

322
00:31:13,873 --> 00:31:15,743
What is it about elevators?

323
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,051
Hey.

324
00:31:29,758 --> 00:31:33,274
- Hi, you must be Ana.
- You must be Elliot.

325
00:31:33,298 --> 00:31:34,952
And we must be going, Elliot.

326
00:31:35,736 --> 00:31:38,893
So awesome your place.
Kate's told me a lot about you.

327
00:31:39,167 --> 00:31:41,982
Elliot grab your shoes, some of us have work to return to.

328
00:31:42,006 --> 00:31:45,218
What you're doing with Mr. Worm here, I've got no idea.

329
00:31:48,451 --> 00:31:49,654
Laters baby.

330
00:31:53,007 --> 00:31:55,728
I'll see you tonight, email me if something changes.

331
00:31:55,918 --> 00:31:57,304
My computer's broken.

332
00:31:57,339 --> 00:31:59,927
Well call then, you know you have my number.

333
00:32:01,739 --> 00:32:03,100
Laters baby.

334
00:32:09,102 --> 00:32:12,942
- Elliot seems really nice.
- No, no. We're starting with you.

335
00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:16,290
If you're seeing him again tonight,
this means that something happened.

336
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:22,516
- Ana? Tell me what happened...
- I have to get ready for work.

337
00:32:23,596 --> 00:32:26,692
We just kissed.
Once.

338
00:32:27,316 --> 00:32:30,165
Only once?
That's odd.

339
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,860
- Odd doesn't even cover it.
- Uh huh, and a new jacket.

340
00:32:52,658 --> 00:32:53,658
Bye.

341
00:32:55,065 --> 00:32:57,493
Hi, its Taylor right?

342
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:00,906
Good evening Miss Steele, Mr
Grey will be joining us there.

343
00:33:16,033 --> 00:33:17,761
Good evening, Anastasia.

344
00:33:33,868 --> 00:33:35,488
What, you're flying this?

345
00:33:53,051 --> 00:33:54,474
No escaping now.

346
00:34:00,088 --> 00:34:03,483
November 1-2-2-4. Charlie Tango.
Ready to depart.

347
00:34:03,579 --> 00:34:06,165
<i>Charlie tango, your flight plan to
Seattle has been cleared..</i>

348
00:34:06,189 --> 00:34:08,835
Seattle?
That's where we're going?

349
00:35:11,686 --> 00:35:14,483
- Would you like a drink?
- Yes please.

350
00:35:40,804 --> 00:35:44,643
- You play?
- Yes.

351
00:35:47,446 --> 00:35:49,071
Of course you do.

352
00:35:55,449 --> 00:36:00,793
- Whats this?
- Its a nondisclosure agreement.

353
00:36:02,038 --> 00:36:06,053
It means you cannot discuss anything about us with anyone.

354
00:36:07,301 --> 00:36:09,362
I'm afraid my lawyer insists on it.

355
00:36:09,397 --> 00:36:12,001
I would never talk to anyone about us anyway.

356
00:36:23,905 --> 00:36:25,988
Are you gonna make love to me now?

357
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:35,430
Two things: First, I don't make love

358
00:36:36,889 --> 00:36:39,506
I fuck-- hard.

359
00:36:42,603 --> 00:36:48,415
- And the second?
- Come.

360
00:37:01,907 --> 00:37:05,231
- Its just around this door.
- What is it?

361
00:37:05,455 --> 00:37:09,306
- My playroom.
- Like your xbox and stuff?

362
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:13,269
Its important you know that you can leave at any time.

363
00:37:13,293 --> 00:37:14,662
Why, whats in there?

364
00:37:16,203 --> 00:37:18,170
I meant what I said, the helicopter

365
00:37:18,205 --> 00:37:20,137
is not standby, for whenever you wanna go.

366
00:37:20,366 --> 00:37:21,950
Just open the door.

367
00:37:39,899 --> 00:37:41,239
Oh my god.

368
00:38:21,176 --> 00:38:22,536
Its called a flogger.

369
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:34,948
Say something please.

370
00:38:41,302 --> 00:38:43,019
Do women do this to you or...

371
00:38:43,043 --> 00:38:45,732
I do this to women.
With women.

372
00:38:46,081 --> 00:38:47,442
Women who want me to.

373
00:38:58,278 --> 00:39:01,766
- You're a sadist?
- I'm a dominant.

374
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:03,146
What does that mean?

375
00:39:03,181 --> 00:39:06,025
It means I want you to willingly surrender yourself to me.

376
00:39:07,082 --> 00:39:08,666
Why would I do that?

377
00:39:09,653 --> 00:39:14,511
- To please me.
- Please you? How?

378
00:39:14,535 --> 00:39:18,692
I have rules, if you follow them, I'll reward you.

379
00:39:19,016 --> 00:39:21,442
If you don't, I'll punish you.

380
00:39:21,466 --> 00:39:25,063
You'd punish me, you'd use this stuff on me?

381
00:39:26,571 --> 00:39:30,457
- Yes.
- What would I get out of this?

382
00:39:33,451 --> 00:39:34,670
Me.

383
00:39:48,557 --> 00:39:53,043
If we were to do this, this would be your room.

384
00:39:53,467 --> 00:39:55,192
You can decorate it however you like.

385
00:39:58,081 --> 00:39:59,572
You want me to move in?

386
00:39:59,996 --> 00:40:02,691
Not full time, just Friday through to Sunday.

387
00:40:02,915 --> 00:40:09,967
- We can negotiate the particulars.
- So-- I'd sleep in here with you?

388
00:40:10,291 --> 00:40:14,953
No I sleep downstairs.
I told you I don't sleep with anyone.

389
00:40:16,877 --> 00:40:19,964
What if I don't want anything to do with that?

390
00:40:19,999 --> 00:40:21,837
Then I understand completely.

391
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,158
But then we wouldn't have any sort of relationship at all?

392
00:40:25,282 --> 00:40:27,850
This is the only sort of relationship I have.

393
00:40:29,355 --> 00:40:35,065
- Why?
- Its the way I am.

394
00:40:43,459 --> 00:40:47,353
When you said negotiate, what did you mean?

395
00:40:47,377 --> 00:40:51,076
I already have the contract prepared.
Fairly detailed.

396
00:40:51,881 --> 00:40:57,137
You would review, and negotiate what
you are and not willing to try.

397
00:40:57,161 --> 00:40:59,618
How can I know what I'd be willing to try?

398
00:41:00,279 --> 00:41:04,543
Well when you had sex, was there
anything you didn't like doing?

399
00:41:07,497 --> 00:41:09,907
We have to be honest with each other for this to work,

400
00:41:09,931 --> 00:41:10,931
Okay?

401
00:41:13,878 --> 00:41:20,289
- I… I wouldn't know.
- What do you mean?

402
00:41:23,673 --> 00:41:28,323
- Because I haven't...
- You're still a virgin?

403
00:41:29,534 --> 00:41:32,449
- I've just shown you--
- I know, I know.

404
00:41:32,873 --> 00:41:36,704
- You've done other things right?
- No.

405
00:41:45,389 --> 00:41:49,732
- Where have you been?
- Waiting.

406
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:53,135
Guys must throw themselves at you.

407
00:41:55,578 --> 00:41:57,386
They're never what I've wanted.

408
00:42:03,191 --> 00:42:04,737
Your biting your lip.

409
00:42:16,974 --> 00:42:20,248
- What are you doing?
- Rectifying the situation.

410
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:21,790
I'm a situation?

411
00:47:17,625 --> 00:47:19,383
You're energetic this morning.

412
00:47:21,207 --> 00:47:24,076
- You hungry?
- Very.

413
00:47:28,113 --> 00:47:29,813
Because I'm making pancakes.

414
00:47:37,511 --> 00:47:39,240
Lets get you cleaned up.

415
00:48:29,366 --> 00:48:30,871
Do you trust me?

416
00:48:42,936 --> 00:48:44,201
Stay here.

417
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:02,279
Hold out your wrists.

418
00:49:19,033 --> 00:49:22,395
Hold them there.
Understand?

419
00:49:24,204 --> 00:49:29,129
- Tell me you understand.
- I won't move my arms.

420
00:49:30,153 --> 00:49:31,251
Good girl.

421
00:49:41,393 --> 00:49:43,681
- Stay still.
- Okay.

422
00:49:53,357 --> 00:49:56,459
- Say yes.
- To what.

423
00:49:56,483 --> 00:49:58,086
Being mine.

424
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:04,422
<i>Christian!</i>

425
00:50:04,446 --> 00:50:06,897
- Shit.
- Its my mother.

426
00:50:11,089 --> 00:50:12,701
- I'm naked.
- Get dressed.

427
00:50:14,914 --> 00:50:19,519
No need to show me around, no need to hover.

428
00:50:19,543 --> 00:50:23,041
- He's sleeping Dr. Grey.
- Still sleeping? He never sleeps in.

429
00:50:23,076 --> 00:50:24,498
Certainly not at this hour.

430
00:50:24,522 --> 00:50:26,142
Unless of course he's ill is he?
Ah.

431
00:50:26,466 --> 00:50:29,619
- Sorry Mr. Grey.
- Its fine I know how she can be.

432
00:50:29,643 --> 00:50:34,378
She? Darling you can try to avoid me, but
the least you can do is.

433
00:50:34,413 --> 00:50:36,683
Call me by my correct name, which is mama.

434
00:50:37,107 --> 00:50:40,234
- Hi.
- Oh, dear god.

435
00:50:40,269 --> 00:50:42,945
Mother, Anastasia Steele.
Ana, meet my mother.

436
00:50:42,969 --> 00:50:44,536
Dr. Grace Trevelyan Grey.

437
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:48,071
You have no idea how delighted I am to meet you.

438
00:50:48,095 --> 00:50:50,273
Its nice to meet you too Dr. Grey.

439
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:52,804
Grace.
She's very pretty.

440
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:54,082
You are very pretty.

441
00:50:54,106 --> 00:50:55,106
Thanks.

442
00:50:56,113 --> 00:50:58,302
What happened to calling before dropping by?

443
00:50:58,726 --> 00:51:01,773
And have your head-henchman give
me the run around here, no thank you.

444
00:51:01,797 --> 00:51:05,745
I'll take my chances. Well I was in the
neighbourhood and I thought perhaps

445
00:51:05,769 --> 00:51:07,107
we could have lunch.

446
00:51:07,131 --> 00:51:09,397
I can't today, I have to drive Ana home.

447
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:14,037
Its okay, take it.
I was just showing mother out.

448
00:51:14,072 --> 00:51:15,072
Excuse me.

449
00:51:16,501 --> 00:51:17,734
Anastasia!

450
00:51:17,758 --> 00:51:19,384
- Kate, wait.
- It was a joy to meet you.

451
00:51:19,908 --> 00:51:22,748
I'm having the whole family for dinner at my house.

452
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:26,385
Christian's sister Mia is back from Paris, so lets come.

453
00:51:26,409 --> 00:51:27,831
We'll see mother.

454
00:51:27,855 --> 00:51:30,046
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

455
00:51:32,186 --> 00:51:33,186
Kate.

456
00:51:34,214 --> 00:51:35,487
Thank you.

457
00:51:40,634 --> 00:51:42,778
I can't talk about it right now Kate.

458
00:51:47,959 --> 00:51:50,126
I gotta go, I'll call you back okay?

459
00:52:08,548 --> 00:52:10,356
Everything okay with the phone call?

460
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:16,138
Yeah, nothing important.
I liked your mom.

461
00:52:17,344 --> 00:52:20,427
She's excited.
She's never seen me with a woman before.

462
00:52:21,051 --> 00:52:22,644
You're the first.

463
00:52:28,229 --> 00:52:29,767
What is it Ana?

464
00:52:31,661 --> 00:52:35,777
I just… How many women have stayed in here?

465
00:52:37,691 --> 00:52:38,949
15.

466
00:52:41,195 --> 00:52:45,261
- That's a lot of women.
- I told you before, if you want out--

467
00:52:45,285 --> 00:52:48,713
I don't want out, I'm just not jumping at the opportunity

468
00:52:48,737 --> 00:52:51,449
for whips, torture and your red room of pain.

469
00:52:51,473 --> 00:52:54,774
The red room is much more about pleasure.
I promise you.

470
00:52:59,066 --> 00:53:02,326
Will we still go out to dinner, and movies...

471
00:53:03,499 --> 00:53:05,162
That's not really my thing.

472
00:53:07,504 --> 00:53:09,069
Try to keep an open mind.

473
00:53:12,697 --> 00:53:16,768
If you agree to be my submissive,
I will be devoted to you.

474
00:53:18,994 --> 00:53:22,666
This is what I want.
And I want it with you.

475
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:32,883
Why do I have to sleep in here?
We slept in the same bed last night.

476
00:53:33,007 --> 00:53:34,649
Like normal people.

477
00:53:35,073 --> 00:53:38,101
Try not to get hung up on the sleeping arrangements.

478
00:53:38,876 --> 00:53:41,757
If you agree to do this, you're gonna want your own room.

479
00:53:42,081 --> 00:53:44,248
Why, because I'll be your sex slave?

480
00:53:44,857 --> 00:53:47,862
I don't wanna do this here, lets talk downstairs.

481
00:53:47,886 --> 00:53:51,884
No. I think I'll hold on to my
freewill a little while longer thank you.

482
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:58,627
Actually you know what, I would like
to go home, can I go home?

483
00:54:02,769 --> 00:54:05,848
- Which one's yours?
- All of them.

484
00:54:56,143 --> 00:54:57,772
Lets go for a walk.

485
00:55:00,525 --> 00:55:05,583
- How did you start doing this?
- One of my mother's friends.

486
00:55:07,251 --> 00:55:10,830
- I was 15.
- She seduced you?

487
00:55:11,354 --> 00:55:18,280
- I was her submissive for six years.
- Seriously, does your mother know that?

488
00:55:18,304 --> 00:55:22,842
Of course not.
No one in my family knows about this.

489
00:55:23,566 --> 00:55:25,055
Part of me.

490
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:32,337
So she introduced you to all of this?
Mrs Robinson?

491
00:55:33,142 --> 00:55:37,405
Mrs Robinson? I'll tell her you said that.
She'll love it.

492
00:55:38,329 --> 00:55:44,095
- You still talk to her?
- On occasions. We're friends.

493
00:55:49,292 --> 00:55:57,098
Ana. I know how intimidating this is.
I felt the same at first.

494
00:55:57,122 --> 00:56:01,733
Well… What made you change your mind?

495
00:56:04,724 --> 00:56:10,835
By giving up control, I felt free, from responsibilities.

496
00:56:10,859 --> 00:56:14,888
From making decisions.
I felt safe.

497
00:56:15,863 --> 00:56:17,707
You will too, you'll see.

498
00:56:20,513 --> 00:56:23,450
I never took anyone in the helicopter.

499
00:56:24,691 --> 00:56:29,729
Never had sex in my own bed.
Never slept with anyone.

500
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:34,014
Ever. Only you.

501
00:56:58,345 --> 00:57:01,249
This is the contract.
Read it carefully.

502
00:57:01,573 --> 00:57:03,693
Email me if you have any questions.

503
00:57:04,139 --> 00:57:06,103
I told you, my computer's down.

504
00:57:06,127 --> 00:57:07,551
Just consider it okay?

505
00:57:13,451 --> 00:57:15,105
I really hope you say yes.

506
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:28,857
- Thanks for the ride.
- Laters baby.

507
00:57:34,169 --> 00:57:36,380
- Um.
- Okay, you're all set.

508
00:57:36,504 --> 00:57:37,495
Your roommate let me in.

509
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,962
I just figured you forgot to tell me about it.

510
00:57:38,986 --> 00:57:41,969
- Do I look okay?
- Tell you about what?

511
00:57:42,004 --> 00:57:44,674
- Just sign here.
- Hold on, do you have the right apartment?

512
00:57:44,698 --> 00:57:46,356
Anastasia Steele?

513
00:57:53,432 --> 00:57:55,891
- Enjoy.
- Another gift huh?

514
00:57:55,915 --> 00:57:58,435
What happened to flowers and chocolate?

515
00:57:58,459 --> 00:58:00,387
I'm dying to hear everything, but

516
00:58:00,422 --> 00:58:02,569
I have to run right now, cause Elliot
and I are having dinner.

517
00:58:02,593 --> 00:58:04,106
And then we're seeing a show at the Gorge.

518
00:58:04,165 --> 00:58:07,153
Jose called for you, twice, by the way.

519
00:58:07,377 --> 00:58:11,619
- Is that some article?
- No... These are.

520
00:58:11,643 --> 00:58:13,963
These are my thesis notes, I left them at school.

521
00:58:14,353 --> 00:58:16,194
Oh okay, well there's yesterday's mail.

522
00:58:25,558 --> 00:58:30,370
- What?
- I don't know. You look-- different.

523
00:58:31,147 --> 00:58:34,568
- I feel different.
- Of course you do.

524
00:58:36,508 --> 00:58:38,965
- Okay.
- Bye.

525
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,154
Bye.

526
00:59:27,058 --> 00:59:29,740
<i>The following are the terms of a binding contract...</i>

527
00:59:30,790 --> 00:59:35,265
<i>Between the dominant and the submissive.
The fundamental purpose of this contract.</i>

528
00:59:35,289 --> 00:59:39,454
<i>Is to allow the submissive to explore her
sensuality, and her limits of safeness.</i>

529
00:59:40,727 --> 00:59:44,476
<i>The dominant and the submissive agree and
acknowledge that all that occurs</i>

530
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:48,101
<i>under the terms of this contract will
be consensual, confidential.</i>

531
00:59:48,225 --> 00:59:51,690
<i>And subject to the agreed limits and safety procedures.</i>

532
00:59:51,714 --> 00:59:57,187
<i>Set out in this contract.
The submissive will agree to any...</i>

533
00:59:57,211 --> 01:00:00,279
<i>sexual activity deemed fit and pleasurable
by the dominant,</i>

534
01:00:00,303 --> 01:00:03,240
<i>Excepting those activities, outlined in HARD LIMITS.</i>

535
01:00:06,137 --> 01:00:10,097
<i>The submissive agrees to procure
oral contraception from a physician</i>

536
01:00:10,121 --> 01:00:14,815
<i>of the dominant's choosing.
The submissive will not enter into</i>

537
01:00:14,839 --> 01:00:17,912
<i>sexual relations with anyone other than the dominant.</i>

538
01:00:19,981 --> 01:00:23,754
<i>The submissive will eat regularly,
to maintain her health and well-being</i>

539
01:00:23,778 --> 01:00:25,352
<i>from a prescribed list of foods.</i>

540
01:00:27,564 --> 01:00:29,845
<i>The submissive will not drink to excess</i>

541
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,007
<i>smoke or take recreational drugs.</i>

542
01:00:34,244 --> 01:00:38,123
<i>The submissive will conduct herself
in a respectful manner.</i>

543
01:00:38,147 --> 01:00:42,034
<i>To the dominant, and so only address him as Sir, Mr Grey.</i>

544
01:00:42,058 --> 01:00:44,067
<i>Or such other title, the dominant may direct.</i>

545
01:00:45,903 --> 01:00:49,571
<i>The submissive may not touch the dominant,
without his expressed permission to do so.</i>

546
01:00:51,876 --> 01:00:53,514
<i>The safe word yellow</i>

547
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:55,610
<i>will be used to bring the attention of the dominant</i>

548
01:00:55,634 --> 01:00:58,034
<i>that the submissive is close to her limit.</i>

549
01:00:58,058 --> 01:00:59,831
<i>When the safe word RED is spoken.</i>

550
01:00:59,866 --> 01:01:01,848
<i>The dominantes actions will cease completely</i>

551
01:01:01,872 --> 01:01:03,632
<i>and immediately.</i>

552
01:01:03,667 --> 01:01:05,410
<i>Submissive.</i>

553
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:11,481
<i>Does the submissive agree to be
restrained, with hands bound?</i>

554
01:01:11,505 --> 01:01:14,297
<i>Does the submissive consent to being blindfolded?</i>

555
01:01:14,521 --> 01:01:17,194
<i>Does the submissive consent to be gagged?</i>

556
01:01:17,218 --> 01:01:20,794
<i>How much pain is the submissive willing to experience?</i>

557
01:01:58,844 --> 01:02:00,147
Christian.

558
01:02:00,964 --> 01:02:03,616
Its been nice knowing me has it?

559
01:02:16,874 --> 01:02:20,453
Let me remind you, how nice it was.

560
01:02:28,424 --> 01:02:29,904
Is this what you want?

561
01:02:57,833 --> 01:02:59,193
Don't make a sound.

562
01:04:56,028 --> 01:04:57,308
That was really nice.

563
01:05:05,626 --> 01:05:07,212
What are you doing to me?

564
01:05:25,675 --> 01:05:27,129
What about here?

565
01:05:29,998 --> 01:05:33,376
Why not?
Is that breaking the rules?

566
01:05:37,229 --> 01:05:41,319
- Speaking of which...
- I haven't made up my mind yet.

567
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,043
You're not staying?

568
01:05:51,504 --> 01:05:55,679
I told you.
I don't sleep with anyone.

569
01:05:56,832 --> 01:05:58,431
Can we negotiate?

570
01:07:20,547 --> 01:07:22,475
That's a hell of a sack Miss Steele.

571
01:07:32,009 --> 01:07:33,299
Business meeting.

572
01:07:59,367 --> 01:08:02,451
- Impressive.
- I've done this before.

573
01:08:05,409 --> 01:08:08,593
- Business meetings I mean.
- Oh.

574
01:08:09,217 --> 01:08:12,068
Miss Steele.
Your meeting.

575
01:08:14,149 --> 01:08:18,319
Page 1-- strike out my old address
and replace it with the new one.

576
01:08:18,643 --> 01:08:20,769
An oversight.
Do go on.

577
01:08:21,193 --> 01:08:23,830
Page 3, section 15-20.

578
01:08:24,254 --> 01:08:28,052
"The submissive shall submit to any sexual activity"

579
01:08:28,076 --> 01:08:32,744
"... demanded by the dominant without
hesitation or argument."

580
01:08:39,846 --> 01:08:44,067
Turn to page 5, appendix 3, soft limits.

581
01:08:44,839 --> 01:08:47,889
- With you.
- Find anal fisting.

582
01:08:48,213 --> 01:08:50,850
- I'm all ears.
- Strike it out.

583
01:08:55,712 --> 01:08:58,022
Strike out vaginal fisting too.

584
01:08:58,446 --> 01:09:00,681
- You sure?
- Yep.

585
01:09:02,887 --> 01:09:03,928
Same page.

586
01:09:03,952 --> 01:09:06,664
"Is the use of sex toys acceptable to the submissive."

587
01:09:06,688 --> 01:09:09,538
Vibrators-- okay Dildos-- fine.

588
01:09:10,294 --> 01:09:13,617
Genital clamps-- absolutely not.

589
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:19,946
- Consider them gone.
- What are butt plugs?

590
01:09:35,417 --> 01:09:38,495
You must go through quite a few non-disclosure agreements.

591
01:09:39,219 --> 01:09:41,801
My staff know only what I choose to tell them.

592
01:09:42,532 --> 01:09:44,485
Please resume Miss Steele.

593
01:09:47,664 --> 01:09:51,428
Also, on page 5, there are some terms
which need clarification.

594
01:09:52,917 --> 01:09:56,376
- Suspension.
- Hanging on a rope from the ceiling.

595
01:09:57,407 --> 01:10:00,575
- For what possible reason?
- For your pleasure.

596
01:10:01,173 --> 01:10:05,914
- Really?
- And mine-- something to consider.

597
01:10:05,938 --> 01:10:07,462
No. Hard limit.

598
01:10:09,581 --> 01:10:14,237
"Is bondage acceptable to the submissive?"
I'm good with rope.

599
01:10:15,309 --> 01:10:18,912
Leather casts, hand cuffs...
Please lose tape.

600
01:10:20,639 --> 01:10:26,214
- And whats others?
- Cable ties?

601
01:10:29,377 --> 01:10:33,133
Can I just say how impressed I am
with your commitment to this meeting?

602
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:38,613
And in that spirit, I'm gonna offer something sweeter.

603
01:10:39,595 --> 01:10:44,927
How about, once a week, on a night
of your choosing, we go on a date.

604
01:10:46,113 --> 01:10:53,018
Just like a regular couple: dinner, movie, ice skating.

605
01:10:53,042 --> 01:10:58,135
- Whatever you want.
- Accepted.

606
01:10:58,935 --> 01:11:03,530
- You're very kind.
- I'll suggest it in Appendix 5.

607
01:11:19,068 --> 01:11:21,690
I would like to fuck you into the middle of next week.

608
01:11:24,669 --> 01:11:28,523
- You're not fighting fair.
- I never have.

609
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:34,919
I'll review all these changes and
try to arrive at a decision.

610
01:11:34,943 --> 01:11:38,034
- You wanna leave?
- Yes.

611
01:11:38,258 --> 01:11:43,556
But your body tells me something different.
Your legs for instance.

612
01:11:44,632 --> 01:11:47,610
The way you're pressing your thighs
together under the table.

613
01:11:49,251 --> 01:11:54,757
The change in your breathing.
And then your complexion.

614
01:11:54,981 --> 01:11:57,791
- My complexion?
- You're flushed.

615
01:11:58,776 --> 01:12:01,739
- That could just be the wine.
- Its the adrenaline.

616
01:12:10,937 --> 01:12:16,128
Say I did stay.
What would happen?

617
01:12:16,952 --> 01:12:21,714
First, I would help you out of that little dress of yours.

618
01:12:22,732 --> 01:12:25,488
- Yes?
- Then I'd be pleased to discover

619
01:12:25,512 --> 01:12:28,518
- ...that you are naked underneath.
- Really?

620
01:12:31,007 --> 01:12:34,595
- Then I would bend you over.
- Right here?

621
01:12:35,367 --> 01:12:38,802
- Yes.
- On this table?

622
01:12:40,261 --> 01:12:41,261
Yes.

623
01:13:00,467 --> 01:13:02,302
Thank you for the meeting Mr. Grey.

624
01:13:13,186 --> 01:13:14,628
This is me.

625
01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:19,467
Didn't know I was a collector of classic cars huh?

626
01:13:22,044 --> 01:13:24,748
You're sure I can't persuade you to stay?

627
01:13:24,783 --> 01:13:26,319
Goodnight, Christian.

628
01:13:26,343 --> 01:13:30,374
- When will you know?
- Soon, maybe.

629
01:13:39,966 --> 01:13:42,084
Why do I think you're telling me goodbye?

630
01:13:43,509 --> 01:13:44,575
Because I'm leaving.

631
01:13:51,845 --> 01:13:53,878
You got your speech ready yet?

632
01:13:53,913 --> 01:13:54,913
More or less.

633
01:13:55,165 --> 01:13:56,937
- Annie.
- Dad!

634
01:13:59,055 --> 01:14:00,055
Hi.

635
01:14:00,147 --> 01:14:02,658
Sorry I'm late, I had a hell of a time parking.

636
01:14:02,682 --> 01:14:04,831
Oh that's okay, you're here, that's all that matters.

637
01:14:04,855 --> 01:14:06,310
You're kidding me, I wouldn't miss this for the world.

638
01:14:06,334 --> 01:14:08,598
I saved you a seat next to Kate's parents okay?

639
01:14:08,622 --> 01:14:10,115
- I'll sit where you want Miss Steele.
- Okay. I'll see you after.

640
01:14:10,150 --> 01:14:11,861
Yeah, good luck out there.

641
01:14:12,085 --> 01:14:15,142
And is also a major benefactor for our university.

642
01:14:15,646 --> 01:14:19,217
Please join me in welcoming, Mr Christian Grey.

643
01:14:34,426 --> 01:14:39,635
Thank you. I am deeply moved by the great
compliment accorded to me today.

644
01:14:40,402 --> 01:14:44,669
- He is so hot.
- Oh god. He so is.

645
01:14:47,903 --> 01:14:49,141
I heard he's gay.

646
01:14:49,176 --> 01:14:51,817
<i>Sustainable methods of farming for third world countries.</i>

647
01:14:52,417 --> 01:14:57,948
The goal? To eradicate hunger
and poverty across the globe.

648
01:15:01,908 --> 01:15:06,778
I myself have known what its like to be profoundly hungry.

649
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:09,464
So this is a very personal mission for me.

650
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:21,009
Anastasia Steele.

651
01:15:22,993 --> 01:15:23,993
Thanks.

652
01:15:27,786 --> 01:15:30,193
Congratulations, you must be very proud.

653
01:15:30,217 --> 01:15:34,819
- I am. Nice tie by the way?
- Truthfully its become my favourite.

654
01:15:35,630 --> 01:15:38,545
- Do you have your answer yet?
- I'm still thinking.

655
01:15:38,569 --> 01:15:41,467
Anastasia, just try it my way.
Please.

656
01:15:42,395 --> 01:15:44,318
- Okay.
- What?

657
01:15:48,429 --> 01:15:49,921
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

658
01:15:54,376 --> 01:15:57,027
- Dad hi!
- I am so proud of you Annie.

659
01:15:57,051 --> 01:15:58,083
Thank you.

660
01:15:58,107 --> 01:16:01,283
Oh, Kate.
Best speech of all others.

661
01:16:01,441 --> 01:16:02,481
- Thanks.
- Of course.

662
01:16:02,490 --> 01:16:03,641
Yeah, I agree.

663
01:16:03,665 --> 01:16:05,705
- Ana? Hi.
- Hi.

664
01:16:06,461 --> 01:16:08,782
Ray, have you met Christian Grey?
Ana's new boyfriend?

665
01:16:08,817 --> 01:16:09,817
Hi.

666
01:16:10,308 --> 01:16:11,487
Great pleasure to meet you.

667
01:16:11,511 --> 01:16:13,001
My pleasure.
I really enjoyed your speech.

668
01:16:13,025 --> 01:16:13,760
Thank you sir.

669
01:16:13,785 --> 01:16:15,966
Sounds like you've accomplished
some pretty impressive things.

670
01:16:15,990 --> 01:16:16,879
And what things?

671
01:16:16,903 --> 01:16:19,886
- Thank you.
- Okay, I'm gonna go find my family, who are

672
01:16:19,910 --> 01:16:21,731
impatiently waiting to embarrass me.
Bye.

673
01:16:21,755 --> 01:16:24,737
- Visit us soon yeah?
- Soon as I get an invitation.

674
01:16:25,509 --> 01:16:27,122
So, how long you two known each other?

675
01:16:28,734 --> 01:16:31,174
A few weeks now, we actually met when Anastasia

676
01:16:31,194 --> 01:16:33,345
interviewed me for the student newspaper.

677
01:16:33,369 --> 01:16:35,650
- A picture please Mr. Grey?
- One minute excuse me.

678
01:16:38,950 --> 01:16:40,145
Big smile now.

679
01:16:49,981 --> 01:16:54,179
To celebrate your graduation.
Among other things.

680
01:16:57,771 --> 01:17:01,090
Roll your eyes at me again and
I will take you across my knee.

681
01:17:06,913 --> 01:17:08,164
So it begins.

682
01:17:12,322 --> 01:17:15,025
- Come on, I've got something to show you.
- What?

683
01:17:24,063 --> 01:17:28,434
That's cute.
Doesn't really seem like your style though.

684
01:17:28,858 --> 01:17:34,902
Its not, happy graduation Anastasia.

685
01:17:35,585 --> 01:17:38,955
Oh my god.
Christian that's a car.

686
01:17:39,789 --> 01:17:41,009
You don't miss much do you?

687
01:17:44,066 --> 01:17:46,223
Thank you but I can't.
This is too...

688
01:17:46,447 --> 01:17:49,244
- Do you like it?
- Of course I like it, its beautiful.

689
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:55,820
But I have a car...
Where's my car?

690
01:17:55,844 --> 01:17:57,999
I told Taylor to fetch a decent price for it.

691
01:17:58,023 --> 01:17:59,967
Christian, this is way too much.

692
01:17:59,991 --> 01:18:01,557
Did you just roll your eyes at me?

693
01:18:09,999 --> 01:18:12,992
- Do you know why I'm doing this?
- Because I rolled my eyes at you.

694
01:18:13,349 --> 01:18:14,559
And is that polite?

695
01:18:16,105 --> 01:18:17,105
No.

696
01:18:17,214 --> 01:18:19,892
- Excuse me?
- No, sir.

697
01:18:38,924 --> 01:18:41,704
- Do you want more?
- Yes. Yes.

698
01:18:49,102 --> 01:18:50,743
Welcome to my world.

699
01:19:12,656 --> 01:19:16,094
- What are you doing?
- There a few things at the office

700
01:19:16,118 --> 01:19:18,445
which require my attention.

701
01:19:18,698 --> 01:19:20,045
You okay?

702
01:19:23,511 --> 01:19:26,310
- I just thought that...
- I enjoyed tonight.

703
01:19:28,540 --> 01:19:30,120
I'll see you at my place tomorrow.

704
01:20:01,205 --> 01:20:02,205
Hi mama.

705
01:20:02,229 --> 01:20:06,414
<i>Anastasia?, whats going on,
I've left you two messages this week.</i>

706
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:11,776
I know I'm sorry.
I just got a little distracted.

707
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:15,154
<i>I'm sorry I missed your graduation honey
I heard it was lovely.</i>

708
01:20:15,585 --> 01:20:17,013
And your new beau.

709
01:20:17,532 --> 01:20:20,695
Ray told me all about him, he sounds such a young man.

710
01:20:21,444 --> 01:20:24,729
<i>Of course, I would've preferred to
have heard about it from you.</i>

711
01:20:28,895 --> 01:20:29,982
Ana?

712
01:20:31,323 --> 01:20:32,398
<i>Whats the matter?</i>

713
01:20:34,209 --> 01:20:35,396
Nothing I'm fine.

714
01:20:36,172 --> 01:20:37,863
Is he not making you happy?

715
01:20:39,209 --> 01:20:42,125
He is yeah, I mean most of the time yeah.

716
01:20:43,190 --> 01:20:44,592
<i>Its complicated.</i>

717
01:20:47,143 --> 01:20:50,297
Listen honey, if you need a break, you just

718
01:20:50,417 --> 01:20:53,028
come on right down here.

719
01:20:53,150 --> 01:20:54,849
<i>Even if its just for a day or two.</i>

720
01:20:54,873 --> 01:20:57,717
<i>I have air miles, and we could talk and have girl time.</i>

721
01:20:59,305 --> 01:21:05,117
- Promise me you'll think about it?
- Yeah I promise. I promise.

722
01:21:06,542 --> 01:21:09,697
- I love you mama.
- I love you too darling.

723
01:21:10,883 --> 01:21:14,215
I gotta go.
Bye.

724
01:21:22,370 --> 01:21:24,845
<i>Looks like you and Grey did some celebration last night.</i>

725
01:21:26,206 --> 01:21:30,282
- Is he still asleep?
- No, he couldn't stay.

726
01:21:31,006 --> 01:21:32,686
Well whose car keys are those then?

727
01:21:36,008 --> 01:21:39,684
- Those are my keys.
- Wow Ana.

728
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:42,800
What?

729
01:21:42,824 --> 01:21:44,461
Nothing, I'm just...

730
01:21:45,125 --> 01:21:47,588
Make sure you're taking it at your own pace okay?

731
01:21:47,612 --> 01:21:50,029
I am, I am, I gotta go.

732
01:21:50,053 --> 01:21:51,399
Where are you going?

733
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:04,095
- Look at this.
- I've seen it, not a bad picture.

734
01:22:04,858 --> 01:22:06,691
Christian Grey and friend.

735
01:22:08,172 --> 01:22:09,146
So we're friends.

736
01:22:09,171 --> 01:22:11,922
Well it must be true, if its in the paper.

737
01:22:13,528 --> 01:22:16,363
- So how did it go with Dr. Greene?
- It was fine.

738
01:22:16,487 --> 01:22:18,558
But she said I had to abstain from

739
01:22:18,593 --> 01:22:20,948
all sexual activity for four weeks.

740
01:22:20,972 --> 01:22:22,732
You know, after I start the pill.

741
01:22:22,739 --> 01:22:23,743
What?

742
01:22:26,896 --> 01:22:27,896
Just kidding.

743
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:45,151
I wanna take you to my playroom.

744
01:22:47,131 --> 01:22:53,698
- I haven't signed the contract.
- I'm well aware. Call it a free sample.

745
01:22:54,986 --> 01:22:56,081
Okay.

746
01:23:02,075 --> 01:23:03,200
Ready?

747
01:23:37,959 --> 01:23:42,923
Eyes down.
Take off your shoes.

748
01:23:46,870 --> 01:23:48,568
Arms above your head.

749
01:23:54,544 --> 01:23:57,137
You have a beautiful body Anastasia.

750
01:24:02,663 --> 01:24:05,058
I want you unashamed of your nakedness, understand?

751
01:24:06,987 --> 01:24:07,987
Yes sir.

752
01:24:09,967 --> 01:24:13,507
Stop biting your lip, you know what it does to me.
Turn around.

753
01:24:21,642 --> 01:24:25,657
When I tell you to come into this room
This is how you'll be.

754
01:24:27,608 --> 01:24:28,808
You'll wait for me.

755
01:24:30,258 --> 01:24:31,844
Kneeling by the door.

756
01:24:42,684 --> 01:24:47,373
Hands flat on your thighs.
Good.

757
01:25:19,659 --> 01:25:21,095
Hold out your hands.

758
01:25:47,934 --> 01:25:51,137
- Did that hurt?
- No.

759
01:25:51,425 --> 01:25:54,566
You see?
Much of your fear is in your head.

760
01:25:56,253 --> 01:25:57,383
Come.

761
01:28:16,635 --> 01:28:20,042
- How does that feel?
- Good.

762
01:28:40,951 --> 01:28:42,105
Quiet.

763
01:30:14,865 --> 01:30:16,255
Where are we going?

764
01:30:21,308 --> 01:30:23,118
Remember my mother mentioned dinner?

765
01:30:23,913 --> 01:30:25,292
My sister Mia's in town.

766
01:30:26,089 --> 01:30:27,089
Yes.

767
01:30:30,653 --> 01:30:34,239
- You got everything you need?
- Yeah.

768
01:30:35,793 --> 01:30:36,852
Dance with me.

769
01:31:24,799 --> 01:31:26,442
Good evening Mr. Grey.

770
01:31:26,477 --> 01:31:27,477
They're here!

771
01:31:27,862 --> 01:31:28,862
You're here.

772
01:31:29,029 --> 01:31:31,985
- Welcome welcome.
- Ana, you've met my mother.

773
01:31:32,020 --> 01:31:32,939
Hi, lovely to see you.

774
01:31:32,940 --> 01:31:35,150
This is my father, Carrick.
Hi, its nice to meet you.

775
01:31:35,185 --> 01:31:36,136
Pleasure to meet you.

776
01:31:36,171 --> 01:31:36,701
<i>Is she here?</i>

777
01:31:36,736 --> 01:31:38,300
There's been a lot of speculation!

778
01:31:38,367 --> 01:31:40,433
Oh my god! She exists!

779
01:31:42,230 --> 01:31:44,497
Its a great apartment, and the rent's not ridiculous

780
01:31:44,885 --> 01:31:46,719
Elliot and Jose helped us move in.

781
01:31:47,601 --> 01:31:51,708
Jose is Ana's friend, although I
think Elliot's trying to poach me.

782
01:31:51,743 --> 01:31:55,130
He's a cool guy!

783
01:31:56,132 --> 01:31:58,305
Ana, where is your family from?

784
01:31:58,613 --> 01:32:01,903
My step father's in Montesano and my mom lives in Georgia.

785
01:32:01,967 --> 01:32:04,314
- Georgia? Which part?
- Savannah.

786
01:32:04,648 --> 01:32:09,487
How nice! Although I hear it gets really
humid in Georgia this time of year.

787
01:32:09,671 --> 01:32:12,995
Oh my god it does.
Its stifling sometimes.

788
01:32:13,001 --> 01:32:14,927
Actually I'm going to visit her tomorrow.

789
01:32:15,101 --> 01:32:18,439
How nice.
You hear that Christian?

790
01:32:18,463 --> 01:32:21,624
Some children do visit their parents now and again.

791
01:32:23,780 --> 01:32:27,123
- Hey dad you catch the Mariners game?
- I heard it went back stream.

792
01:32:29,822 --> 01:32:31,598
This is news to me.
When were you gonna tell me?

793
01:32:31,633 --> 01:32:33,754
<i>I think it was alright though.</i>

794
01:32:34,813 --> 01:32:36,097
Who wants coffee?

795
01:32:36,418 --> 01:32:39,398
Actually I promised Ana a tour of the grounds.

796
01:32:40,105 --> 01:32:41,181
Excuse us.

797
01:32:46,111 --> 01:32:49,288
Christian, I cannot walk that fast in these shoes.

798
01:32:53,305 --> 01:32:54,754
When were you gonna tell me about Georgia?

799
01:32:54,971 --> 01:32:57,608
What?
You have no right to be mad at me.

800
01:32:57,632 --> 01:32:59,822
Yeah but I am mad.
Palm-twitchingly mad.

801
01:33:04,935 --> 01:33:07,422
You're mine. All mine.
Understand?

802
01:33:14,858 --> 01:33:16,842
Christian, you're so confusing.

803
01:33:20,976 --> 01:33:22,856
- Ana.
- What do you want?

804
01:33:24,774 --> 01:33:27,060
- What do you want?
- I want you.

805
01:33:28,225 --> 01:33:29,620
I'm trying, Christian.

806
01:33:34,905 --> 01:33:36,078
I know you are.

807
01:33:37,068 --> 01:33:39,175
Why can't we sleep in the same bed?

808
01:33:40,114 --> 01:33:44,517
Why won't you let me touch you?
Why does it have to be like this?

809
01:33:52,170 --> 01:33:53,938
If you would just sign the contract you wouldn't have...

810
01:33:53,973 --> 01:33:56,120
Why do you care so much about the contract Christian?

811
01:33:56,144 --> 01:34:00,114
- Don't you like me the way I am?
- Of course I do.

812
01:34:00,138 --> 01:34:03,861
- Then why are you trying to change me?
- I'm not.

813
01:34:05,477 --> 01:34:09,031
- Its you.
- I need more, I want more.

814
01:34:10,746 --> 01:34:14,741
Hearts and flowers?
That's not something I know

815
01:34:16,932 --> 01:34:22,551
Ana please-- its you that is changing me.

816
01:34:24,675 --> 01:34:28,461
Let me touch you. Let me.

817
01:34:42,928 --> 01:34:47,501
- Are they burns?
- I had a rough start in life.

818
01:34:47,925 --> 01:34:52,821
- That's all you need to know.
- Okay.

819
01:35:15,888 --> 01:35:20,639
The woman who gave birth to me, was a crack addict.

820
01:35:21,891 --> 01:35:23,153
And a prostitute.

821
01:35:28,189 --> 01:35:29,983
She died when I was four.

822
01:35:34,090 --> 01:35:40,617
I remember certain things.
Terrible things.

823
01:35:44,884 --> 01:35:46,423
I don't remember her.

824
01:35:50,485 --> 01:35:56,200
Sometimes, I can see her in my dreams.

825
01:36:16,217 --> 01:36:17,957
Do you really have to go to Georgia?

826
01:36:22,639 --> 01:36:24,099
Yeah, I really.

827
01:36:47,115 --> 01:36:49,898
- This gazpacho is really salty Bob.
- Yeah.

828
01:36:49,922 --> 01:36:52,518
You'll get fat with all this sitting around
You tell him Ana.

829
01:36:52,542 --> 01:36:55,581
- I'm not gonna tell him that.
- Yes thank you Ana.

830
01:36:55,605 --> 01:36:59,387
I'm just saying gazpacho is in a bowl of salsa.

831
01:36:59,411 --> 01:37:02,163
Now could you hand me some chips for my bowl of salsa?

832
01:37:02,198 --> 01:37:03,614
You can have a carrot?

833
01:37:04,876 --> 01:37:06,747
What are you getting at with this?

834
01:37:07,508 --> 01:37:11,268
You're lucky that I happen to love you-- very much.

835
01:37:11,292 --> 01:37:13,236
- I know that.
- Do you?

836
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:14,313
Hmm, I do.

837
01:38:51,406 --> 01:38:53,170
Oh darling, I think we should pace ourselves,

838
01:38:53,231 --> 01:38:54,651
or at least order something to eat.

839
01:38:54,675 --> 01:38:56,898
You go ahead, I'm not very hungry.

840
01:38:56,959 --> 01:38:59,309
Oh, I just have the fruit salad.

841
01:39:04,527 --> 01:39:08,085
- He can wait.
- Mom.

842
01:39:11,483 --> 01:39:13,063
- Holy fuck.
- What?

843
01:39:13,453 --> 01:39:14,614
What is it?

844
01:39:14,638 --> 01:39:19,550
Its Christian, he's here, in Georgia.

845
01:39:22,146 --> 01:39:24,763
- Here, here!
- Mrs Adams.

846
01:39:24,798 --> 01:39:26,095
Delighted to meet you.

847
01:39:26,319 --> 01:39:28,728
- Something to drink sir?
- Gin and tonic.

848
01:39:28,752 --> 01:39:31,293
Hendrix if you have it, otherwise Bombay Sapphire.

849
01:39:31,317 --> 01:39:33,841
Cucumber with the Hendricks, lime with Bombay.

850
01:39:33,865 --> 01:39:37,310
- I like him already.
- What are you doing here Christian?

851
01:39:37,434 --> 01:39:40,678
- I came to see you.
- I'm gonna step outside for a minute.

852
01:39:51,443 --> 01:39:53,982
I broke rule 7, clause 5.

853
01:39:56,183 --> 01:40:01,342
We'll let it go, lets not talk
about the contract right now.

854
01:40:01,944 --> 01:40:03,405
How was your dinner?

855
01:40:07,183 --> 01:40:09,887
She's a friend, that's all.

856
01:40:14,060 --> 01:40:15,508
She knows me.

857
01:40:16,577 --> 01:40:21,307
- What did she advise you to do?
- Well I'm here.

858
01:40:23,947 --> 01:40:27,596
- Now what?
- I've got a room in this hotel.

859
01:40:29,617 --> 01:40:31,376
Well I hope you'll be comfortable in it.

860
01:40:36,001 --> 01:40:37,802
What are you doing for breakfast tomorrow?

861
01:40:43,477 --> 01:40:46,475
- Where are we going?
- Its a surprise.

862
01:40:47,068 --> 01:40:49,711
I think I've reached my quota of surprises.

863
01:40:51,319 --> 01:40:52,568
We're almost there.

864
01:41:00,506 --> 01:41:03,151
Mr Grey?
Hey, I'll be your co-pilot.

865
01:41:03,175 --> 01:41:05,798
How do you do?
This is my girlfriend, Anastasia Steele.

866
01:41:37,170 --> 01:41:39,743
<i>We're at 400 feet, ready?</i>

867
01:41:40,067 --> 01:41:43,090
- Ready?
- Yes, ready.

868
01:41:43,314 --> 01:41:44,680
Release.

869
01:42:14,196 --> 01:42:15,404
<i>Hold on tight.</i>

870
01:42:17,929 --> 01:42:21,282
- Is this more?
- Oh my god. So much more!

871
01:42:42,233 --> 01:42:46,747
Oh my god, that was incredible Christian.
Thank you.

872
01:42:46,871 --> 01:42:48,779
We aim to please Miss Steele.

873
01:42:49,793 --> 01:42:55,118
- I thought you didn't do romance.
- I don't. Ana.

874
01:42:55,142 --> 01:42:59,594
What? What?
Why are you fighting this?

875
01:43:02,796 --> 01:43:04,416
What are you afraid of?

876
01:43:14,921 --> 01:43:19,384
Grey.
What? When?

877
01:43:21,625 --> 01:43:25,505
Have Stefan get the plane ready.
I'll be on the tarmac in 30 minutes.

878
01:43:25,929 --> 01:43:28,403
- What happened?
- I have to go back to Seattle.

879
01:43:28,927 --> 01:43:30,147
Come I'll take you home.

880
01:43:32,599 --> 01:43:34,668
Oh sweetheart, I wish Christian could've stayed

881
01:43:34,703 --> 01:43:37,395
Bob was looking forward to meeting him.

882
01:43:37,419 --> 01:43:42,337
I know, he had to get back to Seattle though.
There's a um, situation at work.

883
01:43:42,361 --> 01:43:45,893
I wish I could tell you things get easier, but they don't.

884
01:43:45,917 --> 01:43:48,911
You just need to get to know yourself better.

885
01:43:50,333 --> 01:43:53,115
- Thank you for everything mama.
- Take care.

886
01:43:53,150 --> 01:43:54,150
I will.

887
01:44:14,168 --> 01:44:17,182
You think I wouldn't recognise you Taylor?

888
01:44:17,372 --> 01:44:18,694
Right this way Miss Steele.

889
01:44:24,970 --> 01:44:28,721
- How does he seem Taylor?
- Preoccupied I'm afraid.

890
01:44:29,534 --> 01:44:32,001
- Really?
- Yes ma'am.

891
01:44:38,268 --> 01:44:39,685
Well that's not gonna work.

892
01:44:42,021 --> 01:44:43,139
What?

893
01:44:45,155 --> 01:44:50,666
Well tell them they don't have 24 hours.
That is unacceptable.

894
01:44:50,690 --> 01:44:54,040
I need to know.
Just keep me informed.

895
01:45:10,347 --> 01:45:15,926
- Is everything okay?
- Nothing that concerns you.

896
01:45:17,994 --> 01:45:20,388
- I can leave if you want me to go?
- No.

897
01:45:22,153 --> 01:45:23,835
That's the last thing I want.

898
01:45:30,408 --> 01:45:34,660
I want you, in the playroom, in 15 minutes.

899
01:46:02,575 --> 01:46:06,286
- What are your safe words?
- Red and yellow.

900
01:46:06,510 --> 01:46:07,806
Remember them.

901
01:48:16,060 --> 01:48:21,676
That sounds so sad.
Everything you play sounds sad.

902
01:48:23,674 --> 01:48:25,481
You said you were six and when you learned,

903
01:48:25,542 --> 01:48:28,339
was it because you wanted to please your new family?

904
01:48:37,025 --> 01:48:38,591
I just wanna talk.

905
01:48:42,790 --> 01:48:44,630
Why won't you let me in?

906
01:48:47,187 --> 01:48:49,748
- We should be talking.
- Like normal people?

907
01:48:50,131 --> 01:48:51,222
Yeah.

908
01:48:54,893 --> 01:48:56,360
Is that so wrong?

909
01:49:08,884 --> 01:49:11,979
Is this because of the contract?
Because I still haven't signed it?

910
01:49:12,623 --> 01:49:16,821
Fuck the contract, I think its a
little redundant don't you?

911
01:49:18,269 --> 01:49:20,412
So then the rules are redundant too?

912
01:49:20,682 --> 01:49:24,357
- No. The rules stand.
- And what if I break them?

913
01:49:24,920 --> 01:49:27,221
- Then there'll be consequences.
- Punishment?

914
01:49:27,724 --> 01:49:28,724
Yes.

915
01:49:30,125 --> 01:49:32,176
- Why do you want to punish me?
- Ana.

916
01:49:32,970 --> 01:49:34,173
Why do you want to hurt me?

917
01:49:37,306 --> 01:49:40,111
I would never do anything to you,
that you couldn't handle.

918
01:49:40,146 --> 01:49:43,126
But why do you even wanna do anything
at all to me Christian?

919
01:49:45,147 --> 01:49:48,368
If I told you, you'd never look at me the same way again.

920
01:49:49,324 --> 01:49:52,816
So there is a reason.
Tell me.

921
01:49:55,084 --> 01:49:57,290
- Do you wanna punish me right now?
- Yes.

922
01:49:57,614 --> 01:49:59,643
I wanna punish you right now.

923
01:50:01,680 --> 01:50:05,136
What if I told you that I feel the same
way about being punished as you

924
01:50:05,160 --> 01:50:07,762
do about me touching you, would
you still wanna punish me then?

925
01:50:10,417 --> 01:50:13,715
No. But that doesn't mean I wouldn't need to.

926
01:50:13,844 --> 01:50:15,767
- Why?
- Ana stop.

927
01:50:15,791 --> 01:50:18,365
- Why do you need...
- Because its the way I am!

928
01:50:26,501 --> 01:50:28,640
Because I'm 50 shades of fucked up.

929
01:50:51,891 --> 01:50:53,241
Show me then.

930
01:51:07,358 --> 01:51:12,361
I need you to show me, what you wanna do to me.

931
01:51:13,012 --> 01:51:15,536
Punish me, show me how bad it can be.

932
01:51:15,560 --> 01:51:17,392
I want you to show me the worst.

933
01:51:25,464 --> 01:51:27,317
Its the only way I can understand.

934
01:51:41,419 --> 01:51:44,628
- Are you sure about this?
- Yes.

935
01:52:01,702 --> 01:52:02,875
Bend over.

936
01:52:12,256 --> 01:52:16,125
I'm gonna hit you six times.
And you're gonna count with me.

937
01:52:28,595 --> 01:52:32,923
- Count, Anastasia.
- One.

938
01:52:38,795 --> 01:52:40,021
Two.

939
01:52:48,711 --> 01:52:49,711
Three.

940
01:53:00,572 --> 01:53:01,865
Four.

941
01:53:09,431 --> 01:53:10,643
Five.

942
01:53:24,512 --> 01:53:25,670
Six.

943
01:53:44,923 --> 01:53:48,798
Is this what you really want?
You wanna see me like this?

944
01:53:50,260 --> 01:53:52,118
- Ana.
- Don't come near me.

945
01:54:00,154 --> 01:54:01,802
Does this give you pleasure?

946
01:54:05,099 --> 01:54:06,099
No.

947
01:54:11,349 --> 01:54:13,225
Don't you dare come near me.

948
01:55:17,293 --> 01:55:18,761
Please don't hate me.

949
01:55:21,946 --> 01:55:24,049
You will never do that to me again.

950
01:55:32,944 --> 01:55:38,024
- I'm not what you want.
- No, you are everything that I want.

951
01:55:46,838 --> 01:55:48,643
I've fallen in love with you.

952
01:55:52,673 --> 01:55:56,467
No. No, Ana.
You can't love me.

953
01:56:09,883 --> 01:56:11,413
I need you to leave.

954
01:56:18,271 --> 01:56:19,482
Please.

955
01:57:13,719 --> 01:57:18,787
- I'd like my car back.
- Taylor already sold it.

956
01:57:21,168 --> 01:57:23,362
Then I'd like the money he got for it please.

957
01:57:25,054 --> 01:57:26,408
I'll send you a check.

958
01:57:27,315 --> 01:57:28,315
Okay.

959
01:57:34,300 --> 01:57:35,841
Taylor will take you home.

960
01:57:53,738 --> 01:57:54,738
Stop.

961
01:57:55,427 --> 01:57:56,435
No!

962
01:58:11,832 --> 01:58:13,981
- Ana.
- Christian.

962
01:58:14,001 --> 01:58:20,001
