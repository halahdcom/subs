1
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:26,703
Listen!

2
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:27,728
Stop!

3
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:29,506
You silly fucking twit!

4
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,531
Please!

5
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:34,477
You are one stupid
fucking bitch, you know that?

6
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:36,647
Shut the fuck up!

7
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:38,410
No.

8
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,188
There you are.

9
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:47,153
No!

10
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:49,749
No.

11
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:51,762
You're a little shit.
No!

12
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:53,186
No!

13
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,809
Anastasia Steele?

14
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:52,984
Thanks.

15
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,844
Yeah. Got it.
Thank you.

16
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,510
Good morning, Mr. Hyde.

17
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,781
Ana, please, it's Jack.

18
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:59,223
Tea, right? Weak, black.

19
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:02,225
I'm pretty sure I'm
supposed to get this for you,

20
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:04,362
but thank you, Jack.

21
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,212
<i>Barbados is amazing;.</i>

22
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:25,544
<i>It's all coral
and turtles and booze...</i>

23
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:28,745
<i>Oh! You should be here.
Why aren't you here?</i>

24
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:30,620
<i>Yeah, and tell that
douchebag brother at mine</i>

25
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:32,646
to take a day off for once, <i>would</i> ya?

26
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,384
<i>All right. Bye, Ana.
Bye!</i>

27
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,194
<i>So, how's the new job'?</i>

28
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:18,801
It's good. My boss has me
weighing in on submissions.

29
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,706
<i>That's exciting. Great.</i>

30
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,070
Have you heard from Christian?

31
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:26,611
Yeah.

32
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,274
He sent me flowers.

33
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,143
To wish me luck.

34
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:33,718
<i>Sweetheart,</i>

35
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,618
are you ever gonna tell me
what happened between you?

36
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,887
Fundamental
differences, I guess.

37
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,918
It wasn't gonna last.

38
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:53,400
Are those for me?

39
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:55,606
Nah. They can wait.

40
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:56,832
Okay.

41
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,307
Look nice.
Going out tonight?

42
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:03,340
Oh, um, a friend of mine has a
photography exhibition opening tonight.

43
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:04,938
So, gonna go.

44
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,306
Good.

45
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:09,018
How did you make out
with those manuscripts?

46
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:12,346
Oh, really great, actually.
This one, um...

47
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,283
Boyce Fox.

48
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:17,485
I couldn't put it down.
It's so sharp.

49
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:21,121
And relevant. And I think
he's really got something.

50
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:22,289
You think?
Yeah.

51
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:26,131
All right. I'll check it out.
Great.

52
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,963
Have fun tonight, Ana.
Thank you.

53
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:29,300
Thanks for today.

54
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:32,299
Good night, Hannah.

55
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:34,271
Bye!

56
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,992
Glass of chardonnay?

57
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:52,554
Thanks.
Mmm-hmm.

58
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:09,878
Oh, my God.

59
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,013
Jesus Christ.

60
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:22,182
Ana!

61
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,693
You made it.

62
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:26,186
José...

63
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:30,224
This is, like, so much
of my face in here.

64
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,837
Well, if I had asked, you would
have been like, "I'm too shy."

65
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:34,994
Yeah.

66
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:36,837
But you...

67
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:39,336
It's my best stuff.

68
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:40,876
That's so.“

69
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:43,044
Do you like them?

70
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,848
They are super large.

71
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:50,542
Hold on.

72
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:53,888
All the portraits
have sold to one man.

73
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,084
You're kidding!
No.

74
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:02,928
Well, somebody likes them.

75
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,529
They just bought all six.

76
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:07,594
All six?

77
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:09,570
Dinner's on me tonight, okay?

78
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,531
I'll be right back.

79
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,602
Anastasia.

80
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,446
It was you, wasn't it? You just
went and bought all of these?

81
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,443
I don't like strangers
gawking at you.

82
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,484
Why are you here?

83
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,121
For you.

84
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:05,425
Hey.

85
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,794
Can we talk somewhere private?

86
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:10,957
No.

87
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:14,462
Look, I'm not very good at this.
I've never had to...

88
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:17,130
I've never wanted to try again.

89
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,709
Christian, I don't...

90
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,643
It's not a good idea.
Let's talk.

91
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:24,806
Okay? Just talk, please.

92
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:27,641
Have dinner with me.

93
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,187
Okay, fine. I will have
dinner with you.

94
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:39,993
Because I'm hungry.

95
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:43,327
But we are only talking
and that is it.

96
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,200
Hold on.

97
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,743
Hey.
I'm gonna take off.

98
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:01,648
Already? Your photos
are so stunning, José.

99
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,245
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm proud of you.

100
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:39,248
Christian, I can't.
I can't do this.

101
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:41,617
Christ, Ana.

102
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,756
Okay.

103
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,458
I have a proposition.

104
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:53,035
Just come to dinner.
We can talk.

105
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:58,374
Would you like some more time?

106
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:02,244
No. Two steaks' medium.
Fries. Green vegetables.

107
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:06,043
Um, actually, I'm gonna have
the quinoa salad.

108
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,612
Fine.

109
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,948
And two glasses of
the Barossa Valley Shiraz.

110
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,057
We only sell that
by the bottle, sir.

111
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,114
A bottle then.

112
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,619
Yes, Sir.

113
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:17,951
Thanks.

114
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,086
So?

115
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,097
Let's talk.

116
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,062
I want you back.

117
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,970
I'd like to renegotiate terms.

118
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:36,410
But I don't see how.

119
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,809
The things you want, you
said that's the way you are.

120
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:45,082
But what happened last time,
that's not gonna happen again.

121
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,321
How can you say that?

122
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:54,656
I know that I asked you
to show me how far it can go,

123
00:10:57,624 --> 00:11:00,798
but you were getting off
on the pain you inflicted.

124
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:05,837
That's still in you.

125
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,509
I'm working on it.

126
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,443
Working on what?

127
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,184
I can't do this
if you won't talk to me.

128
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,513
What do you wanna know?

129
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,317
Everything.

130
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,520
Fine.

131
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:39,868
Yeah. We'll manage.

132
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,051
My birth mother died
when I was four.

133
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,523
She was an addict. Crack.

134
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,161
You can fill in the blanks.

135
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:00,863
Why didn't you tell me that?

136
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:01,888
I did.

137
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:05,565
But you were asleep at the time.

138
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:09,564
Okay. Well, um...

139
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:11,535
Generally,

140
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,838
a key part of good communication

141
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:18,405
is that both parties
be conscious.

142
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:22,914
I'm really sorry
about your mother.

143
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,414
It's in the past.

144
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:32,428
Now, I brought you here
to negotiate.

145
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,123
You're open to new terms?

146
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:39,067
No rules.

147
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,598
No punishments.

148
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,076
No rules, no punishments

149
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,104
and no more secrets.

150
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,410
I can do that.

151
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:55,814
You want a...

152
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,613
What do you call it?

153
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,954
A vanilla relationship?

154
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:03,151
I mean, we only do what
you're comfortable with.

155
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,125
But you need all those things.

156
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,434
I need you more.

157
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,632
Miss Steele.

158
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,005
Thanks, Taylor.

159
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:27,975
No strings attached.

160
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:56,142
This is spiky.

161
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,209
I like it.

162
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,176
I'll call you tomorrow.

163
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,511
Okay.

164
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:07,685
Good night.

165
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:27,193
Ana, I've been hearing a lot
of good things about you.

166
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,872
- Oh...
- Told you, Liz.

167
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,574
This one actually reads.

168
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:31,731
Hey, Jack.

169
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:34,338
What's the head of HR doing lurking around?
Are we in trouble?

170
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:38,047
Not at all.
I'm just here to encourage.

171
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:42,543
Really? Well, I think a round of
drinks at Lori's would do the trick.

172
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:45,721
Sorry. Meetings.
Otherwise.

173
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:47,323
Who's Lori?

174
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,426
Oh, it's a bar
around the corner.

175
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:51,922
Fridays are a bit of a ritual.

176
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:54,260
You should come.

177
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,758
Absolutely. Go network.

178
00:15:56,923 --> 00:16:00,735
Oh, no, I would. I have plans tonight.

179
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,837
So have your plan come along.
Just for a quick one.

180
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:06,937
Hello?

181
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,100
Yeah.

182
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:12,180
Have fun.

183
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,759
Anastasia.

184
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,930
I'm sorry.
Have we met before?

185
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,455
It's okay.

186
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,260
I'm nobody.

187
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:33,269
Hey. Lori's is this way.

188
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,531
Come on, I'm buying.

189
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,805
All right. Here we go.

190
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:43,606
Mmm. Thanks.

191
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,112
Where is everyone?

192
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:46,944
You know, it's still early.

193
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:51,050
Your comments on Boyce Fox
were interesting.

194
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,985
I'm not usually
into political thrillers.

195
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,390
Yeah, well' I think
the parallels

196
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:57,620
with Dante's Inferno
are amazing, but...

197
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,854
No. You convinced me.

198
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:00,953
I'm reading.

199
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:03,658
Oh. That's great.

200
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,464
Hi! He!

201
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,697
Um, uh...

202
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,568
Christian, this is Jack Hyde.

203
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,569
I'm the boyfriend.

204
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,635
I'm the boss.

205
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,074
What will you have, Chris?

206
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:18,575
Thanks, Jack.

207
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:20,342
Another time.

208
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:24,352
Thanks.

209
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:30,026
Another time.

210
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:33,377
I can't believe you
just talked to him like that.

211
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:35,360
He wants what's mine.

212
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,162
What's yours?

213
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:39,200
That's a little presumptuous.

214
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:42,840
He's my boss, Christian.
You gotta calm down.

215
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,206
Calm isn't really my forte.

216
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,680
I know something that could help.

217
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,513
You know, this is not
what I had in mind.

218
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:01,188
When's the last time
you went shopping?

219
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:04,057
Houston. A week ago.

220
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:05,593
What'd you buy?

221
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,196
An airline.

222
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:12,027
Here.

223
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:17,396
Your new favorite flavor.

224
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:27,949
Excuse me.

225
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,562
Do you need a hand with that?

226
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:44,767
I'll manage.

227
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:46,662
Okay.

228
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:51,903
I know what you're doing.

229
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:54,510
What? I'm being
a culinary mastermind.

230
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,738
You only have to ask.

231
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,981
I think we should take it slow.

232
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:04,413
Okay.

233
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:07,524
Okay.
Okay.

234
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,861
Tell me about SIP.

235
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:14,464
How's it going?

236
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:17,631
It's good.

237
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:21,670
Jack seems genuinely
interested in my opinion.

238
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:23,263
What's morale like?

239
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,364
Morale?

240
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,063
You mean, like,
do we all sit in a circle

241
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:28,138
and sing the company song in the morning?

242
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,976
Is the firm well managed?
Are people happy?

243
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:33,205
Oh, my God.

244
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:34,511
What?

245
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:36,480
You're buying SIP?

246
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,289
No! You can't do that.
That's my job.

247
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,223
You can't start
interfering in my career.

248
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,292
It's not about that

249
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:48,023
I've wanted to move into publishing.
They' re the best fit.

250
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,290
But you're gonna be my boss.

251
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,067
Technically, I'll be your
boss's boss's boss.

252
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:57,070
And I'm gonna be sleeping
with my <i>boss's boss's boss.</i>

253
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:58,708
Right now,
you're arguing with him.

254
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,502
Yeah, because he's being an ass.

255
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,907
An ass. Really?

256
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:04,377
Ass.

257
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:13,012
Ooh...

258
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:17,221
You know that's off limits.

259
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:22,188
I'm gonna need a road map.

260
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,616
I thought you wanted to
take it slow.

261
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:52,856
What do you want, Anastasia?

262
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,861
If we're to communicate,
you have to tell me.

263
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,203
I want you.

264
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:21,387
I'm too dressed.

265
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:34,059
Keep going.

266
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:01,591
Kiss me.

267
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,301
What do you want, Anastasia?

268
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:44,032
I want all of you.

269
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,245
Why do you think you waited?

270
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:29,413
For sex.

271
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:31,010
<i>Mmm.</i>

272
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:33,679
<i>Mmm.</i>

273
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:40,357
I was reading Austen and Bronté

274
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:43,261
and nobody ever
measured up to that.

275
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,697
I guess I was waiting
for something exceptional.

276
00:23:50,696 --> 00:23:52,698
And then I met you.

277
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,210
Would Miss Austen

278
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:01,985
approve of this?

279
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:05,283
I was being romantic,

280
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:08,381
and then you just go and distract
me with your kinky fuckery.

281
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:11,057
"Kinky fuckery"?
Mmm-hmm.

282
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,554
I don't know what that is,
but I like the sound of it.

283
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:55,266
You looked so peaceful.
I didn't wanna wake you.

284
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:59,272
There's not much for breakfast,

285
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,433
unless you want
cold stir-fry.

286
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:03,446
No.
Mmm.

287
00:25:07,106 --> 00:25:09,985
Here. The check you gave me for
Wanda, you should have it back.

288
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:11,143
Keep it.

289
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:13,887
Keep it? It's $24,000.

290
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:15,553
Yeah, I know.

291
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:19,056
I make that kind of money
every 15 minutes. Keep it.

292
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:44,752
Andrea? Good morning.

293
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:49,692
Could you please transfer $24,000 into
the account of Miss Anastasia Steele?

294
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:50,918
No! What are you doing?

295
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:53,894
That's fine.
Thank you.

296
00:25:56,255 --> 00:25:58,667
Why do you have
my bank account details?

297
00:25:59,425 --> 00:26:00,927
What's good for breakfast
around here?

298
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:03,939
Christian, how do you
have my bank information?

299
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,110
Thank you.

300
00:26:12,371 --> 00:26:14,351
Gotta be quicker
than that, Grey.

301
00:26:18,444 --> 00:26:20,890
My parents are hosting
a charity ball tonight.

302
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:23,049
I promised I'd make
an appearance.

303
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:25,188
Want you to come with me.

304
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:29,129
I've never been to a ball.

305
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:31,890
I don't have a dress for that.

306
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:34,362
Also, what am I gonna
do with my hair?

307
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:35,869
I know a salon.

308
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:38,432
And you don't need to
worry about a dress.

309
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,099
It's all gonna be taken care of.

310
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:44,472
What is it'?
Um...

311
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:47,112
There was just a girl
over there.

312
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:49,152
And she was outside
my office yesterday.

313
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:51,950
And she knew my name.

314
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:55,456
And she had a bandage on her wrist.
It was really strange.

315
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,896
We should go.

316
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:05,500
Just now.

317
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,096
Yeah.

318
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,067
Keep me informed.

319
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:14,805
You know that girl, Christian?

320
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,005
I'm handling it.
What does that mean?

321
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:20,181
I don't want you to worry about it.
Trust me.

322
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:29,848
Um...

323
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,430
Hey, how are you doing?

324
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:37,760
Good, okay. So, uh,
my girlfriend's here...

325
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:46,865
Oh.

326
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:20,966
Ana.

327
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:25,812
Was that Mrs. Robinson?

328
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:27,708
Her name's Elena Lincoln.

329
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:29,606
I don't care what her
name is, Christian.

330
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:31,314
Why would you take me there?

331
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:34,915
Why would you take me to meet the
woman who seduced and abused you?

332
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:38,222
Our relationship ended years ago.
We're just friends.

333
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,521
And business partners.

334
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:41,865
Business partners?
Are you kidding me?

335
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:45,365
Would you take your Subs there?

336
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,562
Oh, my God! For what?
Her approval?

337
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:51,732
What?
What is this?

338
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,901
No. It's not like that.

339
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:56,740
That girl that I saw this morning
was one of them, wasn't she?

340
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,080
Let's discuss this
back at my place.

341
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:00,771
I can have someone
come by, do your hair.

342
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,317
Christian, I don't care
about my hair!

343
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:03,877
Explain to me what's going on.

344
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:06,352
I'll explain when
we're there. Come on.

345
00:29:07,546 --> 00:29:09,856
Okay, you can either walk or I
can carry you. Your choice.

346
00:29:10,015 --> 00:29:12,222
You wouldn't do that.
No, it's your choice.

347
00:29:14,353 --> 00:29:16,526
Okay, fine. Fine.
I'll walk.

348
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:23,198
Her name's Leila Williams.

349
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:25,905
She was my Sub for a while
about two years ago.

350
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:28,538
What happened to her?

351
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,744
She wanted more.
I didn't.

352
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,773
So I ended it.

353
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:37,615
She left. Got married.

354
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,780
I thought she moved on, but then
her husband died in a car crash.

355
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,619
She had a breakdown.

356
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,563
What does she want now?

357
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:51,632
When you and I were in Georgia
together, she turned up here

358
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:54,761
and tried to slit her wrists in front
of Mrs. Jones, my housekeeper.

359
00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:56,732
Oh, my God.

360
00:29:56,895 --> 00:30:00,001
Gail took her to the hospital,
but by the time I got there,

361
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:01,406
she'd taken off.

362
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:04,240
My people have been
trying to find her.

363
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,113
Your people?

364
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:10,250
Is that who put this together?

365
00:30:14,413 --> 00:30:15,915
Is there one on me?

366
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:22,492
Let me see it.

367
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:53,786
"Subject works part time at
Clayton's Hardware, Richmond Road."

368
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:57,964
You know, they didn't time
my bathroom breaks.

369
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,501
You should probably
get your money back.

370
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:05,301
I had them drawn up on any
prospective Submissive.

371
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:08,205
Nice. Jesus.

372
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,472
I had no idea what
this was gonna become.

373
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:11,915
I didn't know
you'd be different.

374
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:14,314
Different? Really?

375
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:18,711
Is that why you brought me
to Mrs. Robinson's,

376
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:22,154
where you brought all the other women?
Because I'm so different?

377
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,323
That was wrong. I admit.

378
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:28,488
It's all wrong.
All of this is wrong.

379
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:34,668
You put money into my account that...
I don't want it.

380
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:38,064
You bought the company
I work for.

381
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:42,041
This isn't a relationship,
Christian. It's ownership.

382
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:46,210
I'm trying to understand you.

383
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:51,847
I am just wanting to
get close to you.

384
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,115
But it's really difficult to
do that when you keep doing

385
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:57,852
bizarre things like this.

386
00:31:58,016 --> 00:32:00,736
And it's really difficult to do that
when you won't let me touch you.

387
00:32:10,562 --> 00:32:12,235
Come to my bedroom.

388
00:32:13,732 --> 00:32:16,611
Sex is not gonna fix this
right now. Are you insane?

389
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:18,806
Ana, please.

390
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,485
You wanted a road map?

391
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:41,665
Start here.

392
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:18,536
Those are my boundaries.

393
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,341
I can live with that.

394
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:28,809
Then I'm all yours.

395
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:38,558
<i>Mr. Grey,
your appointment's arrived,</i>

396
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:41,456
Okay. Send him
into Ana's room.

397
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:44,122
He's here.

398
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:46,200
Who's here?

399
00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:51,830
Wow.

400
00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:54,068
Hair up, I think. Yes?

401
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:57,145
Your neck is beautiful.

402
00:33:58,203 --> 00:33:59,375
Christian'?

403
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:05,744
<i>Ciao, Bella.</i>

404
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:55,534
You're just gonna
stand there gawking?

405
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,232
Yeah.

406
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:59,033
Yeah, I think I might.

407
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,089
So I was thinking

408
00:35:20,986 --> 00:35:23,796
tonight might be
more stimulating

409
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,593
if you wear these.

410
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,763
How am I supposed to wear those?

411
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:34,803
Well,

412
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,605
you have to get them wet first.

413
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:40,075
Curious?

414
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:43,975
Mmm-hmm.

415
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:45,913
Okay.

416
00:35:47,012 --> 00:35:48,286
Open your mouth.

417
00:35:57,589 --> 00:35:58,590
Good.

418
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:04,037
Now turn. Bend over.

419
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:07,670
No, you're not putting
those in my butt.

420
00:36:07,866 --> 00:36:10,472
They don't go in your butt.

421
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,228
Stay still.

422
00:36:39,998 --> 00:36:42,205
Stand up straight
and turn around.

423
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:52,988
How's it feel?

424
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,212
Mmm...

425
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,652
Weird.

426
00:36:58,349 --> 00:36:59,760
But good.

427
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:03,261
What do they do?

428
00:37:05,757 --> 00:37:07,532
You'll find oui.

429
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:11,835
Wear the silver satin.

430
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:13,942
It'll go well with these.

431
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:21,239
Don't worry. They're for your ears.

432
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,454
Did I mention it was
a masked ball?

433
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:45,697
No.

434
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:52,911
Your new bodyguards
need to wear these, too?

435
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:55,144
I'm just being safe.

436
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:57,445
You won't even notice
they're here.

437
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:00,981
Come on.

438
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:19,966
<i>The way you wear your hat.</i>

439
00:38:21,566 --> 00:38:24,069
<i>The way you sip your tea.</i>

440
00:38:25,937 --> 00:38:29,646
<i>The memory of alt that.</i>

441
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:34,480
<i>No, no, they can't take that
away from me.</i>

442
00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:38,086
<i>The way your smile just beams.</i>

443
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,131
<i>The way you sing off-key.</i>

444
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:45,197
Everybody's looking at us.

445
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:47,267
Not us. You.

446
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:50,838
Christian! I'm so glad you made it.
Mother.

447
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:52,875
"Mother" is so formal.
Honestly.

448
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:54,135
Ana.
Hi.

449
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:55,667
How you doing?

450
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:58,714
These things are beautiful,
and they are mysterious,

451
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:00,874
but they're a pain in the ass.

452
00:39:01,206 --> 00:39:03,880
You look spectacular.

453
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:07,188
Thank you. So do you.
This dress is so beautiful.

454
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,449
Thank you, Ana.

455
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:11,184
I'm so glad you're back
with Christian.

456
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,487
He was lost without you.

457
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,129
Oh. Can I have my
date back, please?

458
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:16,856
By all means. Spoilsport.

459
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:18,801
See you later.

460
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:27,968
<i>No, no, they can't take that
away from me</i>

461
00:39:30,635 --> 00:39:33,479
Ana! My God!

462
00:39:33,638 --> 00:39:36,983
That dress, it should be illegal.
Monique Lhuillier.

463
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,520
Yeah. Mia.

464
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:41,221
Mia, you know
I barely recognized you.

465
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,757
Yeah! The new me.
Okay, what do you think?

466
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:46,992
Well, it's very, uh, blonde.

467
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,720
How do you put up with him?

468
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:51,766
Do you know he was an even
bigger pain as a teenager?

469
00:39:51,923 --> 00:39:54,995
He got expelled from four
different schools for brawling.

470
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:57,230
That's enough. Yeah,
totally out of control.

471
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,170
- Mia, enough.
- Mia?

472
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,868
I'll be right back.

473
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,540
Hi! How are you?

474
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,838
Hmm?
Ana?

475
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:06,846
You will be sitting here, darling.
Right next to Cary.

476
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:08,006
Christian, you over here.

477
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:11,016
<i>Welcome, ladies and
gentlemen, to our annual ball.</i>

478
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:13,518
<i>As you know,
proceeds from this evening</i>

479
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:17,082
<i>will go to the charity that Grace
and</i> I <i>founded so many years ago...</i>

480
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,194
<i>Coping Together.</i>

481
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,161
<i>Working to make fife better for
the children...</i>

482
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:23,722
of parents addicted to drugs.

483
00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:25,223
Everything okay?

484
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,097
<i>And now, thankfully,</i>

485
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:28,898
<i>I will be handing off
my speaking duties</i>

486
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:32,234
<i>to our master of ceremonies,
Mr. Nomad Paul.</i>

487
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,139
<i>Thank you, Mr. Grey, and
thank you, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

488
00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:37,372
Hungry?

489
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:39,255
<i>Let's start the bidding
with lot number one.</i>

490
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,371
Ravenous.

491
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:42,381
- Do <i>I</i> hear $10, 000?
- Ten!

492
00:40:42,874 --> 00:40:45,115
Now you know what those
silver balls do.

493
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,277
$15,000.

494
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,113
<i>$15,000.</i>

495
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:51,389
<i>Going once, going twice...</i>

496
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:52,550
<i>Said!</i>

497
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:58,131
<i>That's a great start, ladies and gentlemen.
New, lot number two,</i>

498
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:02,404
a <i>week's vacation at'</i> a <i>luxury
chalet in Aspen, Colorado,</i>

499
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,836
<i>donated by
Mr. Christian Grey.</i>

500
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:05,930
<i>Mmm.</i>

501
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:08,475
<i>Let's start the bidding off
at $10, 000.</i>

502
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:09,968
$10,000!

503
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:11,809
<i>Thank you, ma'am. $10,000.</i>

504
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,911
I didn't know
you had a place in Aspen.

505
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:16,108
I have a lot of places.

506
00:41:16,274 --> 00:41:18,419
<i>Boy, we have some ski
lovers in the room tonight.</i>

507
00:41:18,443 --> 00:41:19,478
$17,000!

508
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:22,090
<i>$17,000. Thank you, sir. 18?</i>

509
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,251
$18,000.
$18,000.

510
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:26,088
<i>Thank you. Do I hear 19? 19?</i>

511
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,185
19.

512
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:29,265
<i>$19,000. Thank you, sir.</i>

513
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,492
<i>A week of luxury in
America's finest ski resort.</i>

514
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:34,136
$24,000.

515
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:37,762
<i>New blood! $24, 000 I am bid.</i>

516
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:39,669
<i>Do I hear $25,000'?</i>

517
00:41:39,764 --> 00:41:40,936
That money was for you.

518
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:43,272
And now it'll go to
someone who needs it.

519
00:41:43,935 --> 00:41:48,111
I don't know whether to worship
at your feet or spank you.

520
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:50,843
<i>$24,000.
Going once...</i>

521
00:41:51,776 --> 00:41:53,483
<i>I think...
Going twice...</i>

522
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:54,816
I'll take option two.

523
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:58,525
<i>Sold! To the young lady
in silver.</i>

524
00:42:03,788 --> 00:42:06,792
<i>Your generosity realty makes a
difference, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

525
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:07,993
Let's go.

526
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:35,990
You want this?

527
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,063
I want you to spank me.

528
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:53,842
Hands.

529
00:43:16,394 --> 00:43:19,375
If it gets too much, you have
to tell me to stop, understood?

530
00:43:20,031 --> 00:43:21,032
Yes.

531
00:43:51,896 --> 00:43:52,931
Hold still.

532
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:28,136
I want you to come, Ana.

533
00:44:28,299 --> 00:44:29,642
Come for me.

534
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:50,291
Is this your room?

535
00:44:50,788 --> 00:44:52,131
Once upon a time.

536
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:13,015
Who's this?

537
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:18,391
Is that your mother?

538
00:45:25,656 --> 00:45:28,159
You know you can just say you
don't wanna talk about it.

539
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:31,234
Yeah, I don't wanna
talk about it.

540
00:45:33,164 --> 00:45:35,235
Let's go.
They'll be missing us.

541
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:39,580
Uh, I just need a minute.

542
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,547
I'll meet you downstairs.

543
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:42,873
Okay.

544
00:45:44,342 --> 00:45:45,912
Don't forget your mask.

545
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:16,878
<i>Under my skin.</i>

546
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:22,783
<i>I'd sacrifice anything
come what might.</i>

547
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,757
<i>For the sake of having you near.</i>

548
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:25,916
What?

549
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:27,888
Nothing.

550
00:46:29,053 --> 00:46:33,627
<i>Comes in the night And repeats
and repeats in my ear.</i>

551
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:39,104
<i>Don't you know, little fool
You never can win</i>

552
00:46:51,242 --> 00:46:52,915
Christian has a date.

553
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:55,346
I'm impressed.

554
00:46:56,514 --> 00:46:58,016
I'm sorry.

555
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:00,121
Elena.

556
00:47:00,284 --> 00:47:02,321
I wanted to meet you.

557
00:47:04,789 --> 00:47:06,700
I can't say the same.
Excuse me.

558
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:09,360
Hey, I'm not the enemy.

559
00:47:11,529 --> 00:47:14,135
I know what you did
to Christian.

560
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:17,836
All I did was lead him to the
truth of who he really is.

561
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:21,643
Without me, he'd be
in jail or dead.

562
00:47:21,806 --> 00:47:23,183
And he would say the same.

563
00:47:23,274 --> 00:47:24,314
I'm not listening to this.

564
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:28,118
Do you think you're the first
woman he'd hoped would save him?

565
00:47:28,713 --> 00:47:32,183
He needs a Submissive in life.

566
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,193
Not just in the bedroom.

567
00:47:35,386 --> 00:47:37,662
No, he's changing that.

568
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:39,793
It's not what he wants anymore.

569
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:41,527
But it's what he needs.

570
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:45,003
And you don't strike me as the type
of woman who wants to be owned.

571
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:49,334
If you really wanna make him
happy, if you wanna be happy,

572
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:51,546
you'll let him go.

573
00:47:52,303 --> 00:47:56,809
There's no way that someone like you
could ever understand what we have.

574
00:47:56,974 --> 00:47:58,647
I've been there.

575
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:00,720
Nothing lasts.

576
00:48:01,312 --> 00:48:02,313
Nothing.

577
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:05,721
Whatever happens
between me and Christian

578
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:07,853
is none of your
goddamn business.

579
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:10,089
So you stay the fuck
away from us.

580
00:48:16,861 --> 00:48:19,432
Hey, we should
think about going soon.

581
00:48:19,597 --> 00:48:21,167
I wanna go now.

582
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:32,585
What did Elena say to you'?

583
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,555
Nothing I didn't already know.

584
00:48:44,455 --> 00:48:46,628
Will you just take me
to my house?

585
00:48:47,792 --> 00:48:49,430
Stay with me tonight.

586
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:03,951
Hey, wake up.
We're home. Hmm.

587
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:12,149
Sir?

588
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,225
Stay here.

589
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:43,249
We'll have the car towed.

590
00:49:43,414 --> 00:49:44,757
What happened?

591
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:47,762
That's my car!
What happened to my car?

592
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,296
Check the apartment.
Call me when it's safe.

593
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,697
Yes, sir. Right away.
Copy that

594
00:49:50,855 --> 00:49:52,357
Smith, you stick
with Mr. Grey.

595
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:56,100
Where are we going?

596
00:49:56,694 --> 00:49:58,139
Christian'?

597
00:49:59,196 --> 00:50:01,005
<i>Do</i> you <i>think</i> it was <i>Leila?</i>

598
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:03,668
<i>You really think she would
do something like that?</i>

599
00:50:07,204 --> 00:50:09,516
I really don't see why we can't
just go back to your apartment.

600
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,645
That place is like a fortress.

601
00:50:11,809 --> 00:50:13,982
There's no way she could
have gotten in there.

602
00:50:14,144 --> 00:50:17,182
She shouldn't have been able to
get into the garage, either.

603
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:19,191
I'm not taking any chances.

604
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:28,693
Good evening, Mr. Grey.

605
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:29,997
Hey, Ed.

606
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:34,033
The rest of the crew
will be here in the morning.

607
00:50:40,638 --> 00:50:43,380
If something were to happen
to you because of me...

608
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,384
It won't.

609
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,054
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

610
00:50:55,986 --> 00:50:57,659
Can I wash this off?

611
00:51:01,158 --> 00:51:03,001
Don't stray from the lines.

612
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,264
Okay.

613
00:51:35,793 --> 00:51:37,534
Are these burns?

614
00:51:39,697 --> 00:51:41,699
Who did this to you?

615
00:51:43,634 --> 00:51:45,272
Go on, it's over.

616
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:57,993
I know how difficult it is
for you to open up to me

617
00:52:00,217 --> 00:52:02,163
and tell me these things.

618
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:08,297
But it means the world to me.

619
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,966
It means you love me.

620
00:52:13,664 --> 00:52:16,406
Yes, I do.

621
00:52:45,029 --> 00:52:48,101
So this is where your knot-tying
expertise comes from.

622
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:49,608
Good morning.

623
00:52:50,434 --> 00:52:51,606
Sleep well?

624
00:52:51,769 --> 00:52:52,873
I did.

625
00:52:55,773 --> 00:52:57,548
This boat is really beautiful.

626
00:52:58,275 --> 00:53:00,186
This is from my yard in Seattle.

627
00:53:00,611 --> 00:53:01,885
You built it?

628
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,652
I had some help.

629
00:53:04,715 --> 00:53:06,353
It's called The Grace.

630
00:53:08,052 --> 00:53:09,463
After your mom?

631
00:53:10,454 --> 00:53:12,229
You sound surprised.

632
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:15,233
Well, you're always
so cool towards her.

633
00:53:16,226 --> 00:53:18,137
I owe everything to Grace.

634
00:53:18,295 --> 00:53:20,798
She saved my life
after my birth mom died.

635
00:53:23,634 --> 00:53:25,807
Do you remember your birth mom?

636
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:27,539
I try not to.

637
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:32,209
What happened to her?

638
00:53:33,477 --> 00:53:34,547
She overdosed.

639
00:53:34,645 --> 00:53:37,251
They found her body
three days later.

640
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:41,219
Where were you?

641
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:42,591
I was with her.

642
00:53:44,755 --> 00:53:46,166
Oh, my God.

643
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:49,666
Took her away.
Took me to a hospital.

644
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:52,673
<i>Grace was there.</i>

645
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,946
Thank you for telling me.

646
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,849
Look at that house.

647
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:11,254
That's beautiful.
The view's probably amazing.

648
00:54:11,348 --> 00:54:13,055
I wonder who lives there.

649
00:54:13,851 --> 00:54:15,797
It's an old sea widow.

650
00:54:15,953 --> 00:54:18,024
Lost her husband years ago.

651
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:21,260
Sits at the window every night
waiting for him to come home.

652
00:54:22,693 --> 00:54:24,536
Did you just make that up?

653
00:54:24,695 --> 00:54:25,696
Yeah.

654
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:30,370
You wanna take the helm?

655
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:31,435
Me?

656
00:54:31,535 --> 00:54:33,378
Yeah, you. Come on.

657
00:54:33,537 --> 00:54:35,881
I can't do that.

658
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,406
See where I'm looking'?
Yeah.

659
00:54:59,563 --> 00:55:00,564
Right there. Just hold.

660
00:55:00,831 --> 00:55:02,139
Okay?
Okay.

661
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:11,718
No, you're fine, Ana.
I'm still here.

662
00:55:11,742 --> 00:55:12,777
Don't let go.

663
00:55:12,843 --> 00:55:14,083
I have to let go.
Don't.

664
00:55:14,244 --> 00:55:15,416
Oh, my God. Okay.
Okay?

665
00:55:15,579 --> 00:55:17,320
You ready?
Okay.

666
00:55:32,196 --> 00:55:34,608
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
I'm steering it.

667
00:55:34,765 --> 00:55:36,767
I'm doing it.
I'm the captain.

668
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,944
Oh, my God!

669
00:55:51,782 --> 00:55:53,557
Hey.
Hey, Jack.

670
00:55:53,717 --> 00:55:56,027
Personal calls on your
own time, okay?

671
00:56:04,962 --> 00:56:05,997
Yeah?

672
00:56:06,063 --> 00:56:07,667
Um, did you get my message?

673
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:12,341
You had a phone call this morning
with Ruth Carusi at 9:00 a.m.

674
00:56:12,669 --> 00:56:13,704
Shit.

675
00:56:14,471 --> 00:56:16,382
Loan just reschedule it.
I'll ask them.

676
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:19,316
Did you book our rooms
for New York yet?

677
00:56:20,244 --> 00:56:21,245
Sorry?

678
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:24,484
New York. Book expo. This Friday.
It's in the diary.

679
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:27,188
No, yeah, I know. Yeah, I
booked your room. Of course.

680
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:28,924
And you.

681
00:56:29,086 --> 00:56:31,430
It's expected that
my assistant also attends.

682
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:35,196
I didn't know that.
I'm sorry.

683
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:36,429
Don't apologize.

684
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:38,595
Just get yourself a room.

685
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:42,737
Unless you'd rather stay
back with your boyfriend.

686
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,077
I mean, ifs not like
you need to work.

687
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:49,746
I'll sort it out.

688
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,020
Eric, hey. It's Jack.
How was your weekend?

689
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:56,186
No shit.

690
00:56:56,914 --> 00:56:59,554
Mine was great.
It was fantastic.

691
00:57:00,517 --> 00:57:02,622
Yeah, 'cause I read
your new pages.

692
00:57:03,186 --> 00:57:05,359
No, they're amazing.
Amazing.

693
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:07,860
No, I couldn't put it down.

694
00:57:08,025 --> 00:57:10,369
We'll be accessing state and
federal grants of course,

695
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:12,338
but more than 70% of the funding...

696
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:15,536
will come directly from
Grey Enterprises Holdings.

697
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:17,704
We'll be making cutting edge
renewable energy tech

698
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:19,441
that will more than
repay our investment.

699
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:44,301
Provides a solid consumer base.

700
00:57:44,394 --> 00:57:45,896
For our products.

701
00:57:46,063 --> 00:57:48,339
We're aware that
you have other bidders

702
00:57:48,432 --> 00:57:52,073
and some of them may offer what
look like better terms, but...

703
00:58:06,083 --> 00:58:07,153
Hello?

704
00:58:11,121 --> 00:58:12,191
Christian'?

705
00:58:14,524 --> 00:58:16,299
Oh, my God!

706
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:18,671
Oh, excuse me, Miss Steele,
I didn't mean to startle you.

707
00:58:18,695 --> 00:58:20,368
No, no.

708
00:58:20,931 --> 00:58:22,308
You are very quiet.

709
00:58:22,766 --> 00:58:25,474
I'm Mrs. Jones. Mr. Grey's
housekeeper. May I?

710
00:58:25,869 --> 00:58:26,870
Oh, um...

711
00:58:27,938 --> 00:58:29,645
Sure. Thank you.

712
00:58:30,974 --> 00:58:32,009
Um, I'm Ana.

713
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:36,146
But you knew that already
because you said my last name.

714
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:39,192
Mr. Grey is in his study,
just finishing up a call.

715
00:58:39,649 --> 00:58:42,061
I'll be in the kitchen
if you need me. Okay.

716
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:07,275
See anything you like?

717
01:00:08,305 --> 01:00:10,216
Oh, fuck.

718
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:14,449
The door was, um, unlocked.

719
01:00:16,146 --> 01:00:18,285
I'll have to talk to
Mrs. Jones.

720
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:22,721
Does she come in here a lot?

721
01:00:25,755 --> 01:00:27,325
Does she dust in here?

722
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:30,935
Those are nipple clamps.

723
01:00:35,899 --> 01:00:37,606
Come here.
Give me your hand.

724
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:51,991
It's even more intense
when you take them off.

725
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:56,163
Ow.

726
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:08,275
What's this?

727
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:11,101
Okay.

728
01:01:11,801 --> 01:01:13,109
That's enough show-and-tell.

729
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:14,647
What's this?

730
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:19,146
Let's learn to walk
before we run.

731
01:01:20,377 --> 01:01:22,789
I kinda like running.

732
01:01:26,116 --> 01:01:27,117
Ana?
Mmm-hmm?

733
01:01:28,852 --> 01:01:33,198
Last time we did this,
you saw another side of me.

734
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:35,230
And you left.

735
01:01:37,294 --> 01:01:39,205
Last time was different.

736
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:47,546
All right. But not here.

737
01:01:50,307 --> 01:01:51,547
Mrs. Jones.

738
01:01:52,676 --> 01:01:54,383
Oh, my God.

739
01:03:28,772 --> 01:03:29,842
You're mine.

740
01:03:31,608 --> 01:03:32,916
I'm yours.

741
01:04:02,772 --> 01:04:04,615
You okay?
Yeah.

742
01:04:41,478 --> 01:04:44,891
You know at some point we're
gonna need to talk about New York.

743
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:46,483
We have talked about it.

744
01:04:46,649 --> 01:04:49,323
You forbidding it is
not us talking about it.

745
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:52,994
If you wanna go to New
York, don't go with Hyde.

746
01:04:53,156 --> 01:04:54,863
Let me take you.
I have a place there.

747
01:04:55,325 --> 01:04:57,168
Of course you do.

748
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:58,900
This isn't
some sort of vacation.

749
01:04:58,995 --> 01:05:02,738
It's a work trip with <i>my</i> boss,
who I would like to impress.

750
01:05:03,867 --> 01:05:06,108
You know he's had three
assistants in the last 18 months,

751
01:05:06,202 --> 01:05:07,943
all of whom have quit
without notice?

752
01:05:08,037 --> 01:05:09,516
You don't think
I can handle him?

753
01:05:09,672 --> 01:05:11,413
That's not il.

754
01:05:11,841 --> 01:05:13,718
That's what it feels like.

755
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:18,684
Ana, I know full well
that you can handle anything.

756
01:05:18,848 --> 01:05:22,261
And, uh, if you really wanna go,

757
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:23,921
then I can't stop you.

758
01:05:24,721 --> 01:05:26,564
But I'd like to
take you there myself.

759
01:05:31,694 --> 01:05:32,695
Okay.

760
01:05:34,197 --> 01:05:35,574
Okay?

761
01:05:36,199 --> 01:05:37,200
Yeah.

762
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:41,408
I mean, of course I would
rather see New York with you.

763
01:05:42,205 --> 01:05:43,206
Good.

764
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:45,415
I hate it when we fight.

765
01:05:46,709 --> 01:05:48,245
That wasn't a fight.

766
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:51,722
That was a conversation.

767
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:55,454
It was, you know, when somebody
talks, and the other person listens,

768
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:57,222
and you resolve an issue.

769
01:05:57,420 --> 01:05:58,763
That's how it works.

770
01:05:58,922 --> 01:06:00,230
It's crazy, isn't it?

771
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:04,063
Night, Ana.

772
01:06:04,227 --> 01:06:05,467
Good night, Hannah.

773
01:06:31,488 --> 01:06:32,660
You leaving?

774
01:06:33,156 --> 01:06:37,127
Um, I was actually just about to come
talk to you. Uh, about New York.

775
01:06:38,094 --> 01:06:39,471
There a problem?

776
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:40,663
Um...

777
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:44,543
I'm so grateful
for the opportunity, Jack,

778
01:06:44,634 --> 01:06:46,773
but with such short notice,
I made plans

779
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:47,940
that I can't change.
Huh.

780
01:06:48,938 --> 01:06:51,009
But I will have my phone
on me all weekend.

781
01:06:51,107 --> 01:06:53,713
So if you need anything,
I'm available.

782
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:57,282
<i>Ana, have a seat.</i>

783
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:02,459
I'm really... I'm sorry.

784
01:07:05,288 --> 01:07:07,791
I think you have
tremendous potential here.

785
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:10,232
But I don't wanna waste my time

786
01:07:10,326 --> 01:07:12,966
training someone who doesn't
take this position seriously.

787
01:07:13,129 --> 01:07:14,199
I do.

788
01:07:15,298 --> 01:07:16,641
This is my dream job.

789
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:20,474
Then shouldn't going to New York and
the book expo be part of that dream?

790
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:21,641
It is.

791
01:07:22,305 --> 01:07:23,909
It is.

792
01:07:24,007 --> 01:07:26,214
It was just a misunderstanding.
It won't happen again.

793
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:31,189
Because there are plenty of qualified
people who would kill for this job.

794
01:07:31,347 --> 01:07:35,693
I mean, look, I don't wanna brag,
but I'm a pretty great teacher.

795
01:07:37,687 --> 01:07:38,825
I'm sure you are.

796
01:07:38,988 --> 01:07:42,834
I'm just not seeing the
initiative on your side of it.

797
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:46,247
I've read more than
you've asked me to.

798
01:07:46,863 --> 01:07:49,241
And I'm on top of everything...

799
01:07:49,332 --> 01:07:53,405
I'm talking about
going the extra mile.

800
01:07:54,871 --> 01:07:56,373
Unless you want me

801
01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:59,752
to compete with Christian Grey

802
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:02,381
for your attention.

803
01:08:03,046 --> 01:08:08,223
I apologize that Christian was so
curt with you the other night.

804
01:08:08,384 --> 01:08:09,920
Is that what this is about?

805
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:15,362
Your boyfriend has
a reputation for being

806
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:17,897
a little ruthless.

807
01:08:18,061 --> 01:08:19,734
Is that what you like?

808
01:08:20,196 --> 01:08:22,942
If you have a problem with my work,
then you should take it up with HR.

809
01:08:22,966 --> 01:08:24,036
Whoa.

810
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:26,877
Why are you being so serious?

811
01:08:27,370 --> 01:08:29,941
What do you think I'm gonna do'?
Make you fuck me?

812
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,107
Jack.

813
01:08:32,075 --> 01:08:33,713
I just think...

814
01:08:34,877 --> 01:08:36,788
I just think

815
01:08:38,081 --> 01:08:40,391
if you're gonna fuck
your way to prominence,

816
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:45,456
then you should do it with someone
who can at least make you smarter.

817
01:08:46,055 --> 01:08:47,728
Not just richer.

818
01:08:49,092 --> 01:08:50,093
Right?

819
01:08:50,393 --> 01:08:53,738
Don't...
Don't what'? Hmm?

820
01:08:55,231 --> 01:08:59,407
Look, this is a serious,
serious question.

821
01:09:00,570 --> 01:09:02,572
Do you wanna be kept

822
01:09:04,607 --> 01:09:07,747
or taken seriously?
Hmm?

823
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:09,915
I would like to leave,
please, Jack.

824
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:11,251
Plus...

825
01:09:13,416 --> 01:09:18,593
I can make you come
like nobody else has.

826
01:09:19,622 --> 01:09:21,260
Not him.

827
01:09:21,758 --> 01:09:23,431
Not anyone.

828
01:09:23,493 --> 01:09:24,494
No.

829
01:09:35,438 --> 01:09:36,815
Ana?
Ana, what happened?

830
01:09:36,973 --> 01:09:41,786
Jack Hyde tried to touch me.

831
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:42,845
I'll kill him.

832
01:09:42,945 --> 01:09:45,357
No, no, please don't go.
Don't go. Don't leave me.

833
01:09:45,448 --> 01:09:46,722
Okay. Go.

834
01:09:46,816 --> 01:09:47,988
It's okay. Hey...

835
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:51,120
I left everything. I don't
have any of my stuff.

836
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:52,860
Taylor will get it.
It's fine, okay?

837
01:09:52,955 --> 01:09:54,457
I'll take you home, come on.

838
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:57,130
And his pass has been cancelled?

839
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:58,661
Good.

840
01:09:59,495 --> 01:10:01,805
No. Thank you, Jerry.
Good night.

841
01:10:06,169 --> 01:10:08,046
Well, at least
that's dealt with.

842
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:10,582
Hyde's out.
He's been fired.

843
01:10:10,673 --> 01:10:11,674
Whoa.

844
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:15,655
How? That's...

845
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:20,222
But I thought your deal with
SIP hasn't been finished yet.

846
01:10:20,683 --> 01:10:23,186
It's not.
But I know the CEO.

847
01:10:24,353 --> 01:10:26,026
I told him what happened.

848
01:10:26,823 --> 01:10:28,496
You'll never have to
see him again.

849
01:10:29,692 --> 01:10:32,195
Am I still gonna have a job
now that he's not there?

850
01:10:32,829 --> 01:10:34,775
Well, if you don't,
you can just...

851
01:10:34,864 --> 01:10:37,606
Christian, you know
I love working.

852
01:10:38,201 --> 01:10:40,738
You can't keep me locked up
in your penthouse.

853
01:10:46,008 --> 01:10:47,612
What if I gave you a key?

854
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:50,246
<i>I</i> mean,

855
01:10:50,379 --> 01:10:54,919
what if you had a key, and you
kept some of your stuff here?

856
01:10:55,084 --> 01:11:00,261
Keep all of your stuff here
and you slept, you know...

857
01:11:00,423 --> 01:11:02,266
Not at your place.

858
01:11:04,861 --> 01:11:07,899
Are you asking me
to move in with you?

859
01:11:10,233 --> 01:11:11,234
Mmm-hmm.

860
01:11:13,703 --> 01:11:14,909
Are you sure?

861
01:11:15,204 --> 01:11:16,239
Yes.

862
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:20,042
I want you here all the time.

863
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:23,548
As soon as possible.

864
01:11:29,919 --> 01:11:32,957
What happened to learning
to walk before we run?

865
01:11:34,457 --> 01:11:38,234
That's just one of the many things that
we could talk about over breakfast.

866
01:11:44,433 --> 01:11:45,776
Can I think about it?

867
01:11:46,569 --> 01:11:48,105
Sure.

868
01:11:48,404 --> 01:11:49,405
Yeah.

869
01:11:58,247 --> 01:11:59,419
Liz, hi!

870
01:11:59,582 --> 01:12:02,620
Ana, don't know if you heard,
but Jack resigned last night.

871
01:12:02,785 --> 01:12:03,786
In kind of a hurry.

872
01:12:03,953 --> 01:12:07,332
SIP isn't recruiting
right now, so we're screwed.

873
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:09,369
So you don't need me
anymore then?

874
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:11,335
I'm gonna try to find you
something temporary.

875
01:12:11,427 --> 01:12:13,930
Could you fill in for Jack
at this morning's meeting?

876
01:12:14,096 --> 01:12:15,700
At the senior editors' meeting?

877
01:12:15,798 --> 01:12:16,936
Just for today.

878
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:18,959
You're the only one
who knows Jack's entire slate.

879
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:21,140
Well, yeah, but, I...

880
01:12:24,607 --> 01:12:26,177
You're right.
It's too much.

881
01:12:29,145 --> 01:12:30,283
No, I can do it.

882
01:12:31,814 --> 01:12:33,953
It's fine. I can do it.

883
01:12:35,318 --> 01:12:36,490
Great.

884
01:12:38,955 --> 01:12:40,457
Call me when you're done.

885
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:44,999
We need to print fewer titles.

886
01:12:45,161 --> 01:12:46,697
Stick with established authors.

887
01:12:46,863 --> 01:12:48,672
Focus on our core readership.

888
01:12:48,831 --> 01:12:49,969
Expand it.

889
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:52,034
I'm sorry.

890
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:56,213
Um, uh... So, Ana, what do you
think we should be publishing?

891
01:12:59,075 --> 01:13:01,180
Um, newer voices.

892
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:03,654
Along with your established authors.
Mmm-hmm.

893
01:13:03,813 --> 01:13:07,693
Boyce Fox, for example,
got 80,000 hits last week.

894
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:09,150
Really?

895
01:13:09,185 --> 01:13:12,997
Online hits don't automatically
translate to print sales.

896
01:13:13,155 --> 01:13:15,499
Well, but they could.

897
01:13:15,658 --> 01:13:18,366
His online audience
is an 1840-24 demographic,

898
01:13:18,527 --> 01:13:22,031
and those are exactly the readers
that we should be chasing.

899
01:13:22,498 --> 01:13:26,537
Urn, I mean, lean show you the stats.
I think he's worth taking a risk on.

900
01:13:28,704 --> 01:13:30,547
Maybe we should take a look.

901
01:13:40,516 --> 01:13:42,018
Great idea.

902
01:13:43,452 --> 01:13:45,693
Uh, Ana? Ana, just...

903
01:13:45,855 --> 01:13:48,461
Mr. Roach, I'm really sorry
if I was out of line.

904
01:13:48,624 --> 01:13:50,695
No, don't be sorry.
You made a lot of sense.

905
01:13:51,627 --> 01:13:54,870
No, so, uh, what are you doing
now that Jack Hyde's gone?

906
01:13:55,464 --> 01:13:59,913
Um, well, Liz mentioned something
temporary. I don't know.

907
01:13:59,969 --> 01:14:02,745
Okay. So why don't you
fill in for Jack temporarily?

908
01:14:03,539 --> 01:14:05,382
Good?
Um...

909
01:14:06,208 --> 01:14:08,415
Great. Okay.
That's settled.

910
01:14:59,261 --> 01:15:01,263
<i>To SIP's new fiction editor.</i>

911
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:03,273
Acting fiction editor.

912
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:05,809
Till they find out
how good you are.

913
01:15:08,971 --> 01:15:11,008
Christian, did you have
something to do with this?

914
01:15:11,774 --> 01:15:14,948
No. Hey, it was all you.

915
01:15:17,446 --> 01:15:18,686
What? You don't
believe me?

916
01:15:18,781 --> 01:15:20,954
I don't believe it myself.

917
01:15:25,321 --> 01:15:26,994
I asked you a question
last night.

918
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:30,336
About moving in with you?
Mmm-hmm.

919
01:15:35,331 --> 01:15:37,811
I just think that
I'm probably...

920
01:15:39,335 --> 01:15:42,578
I need to get some things
from my apartment.

921
01:15:45,341 --> 01:15:46,684
That can be arranged.

922
01:15:48,144 --> 01:15:49,316
Good.

923
01:15:51,147 --> 01:15:53,354
Now, maybe we could

924
01:15:54,316 --> 01:15:56,489
take this celebration home.

925
01:15:58,988 --> 01:16:00,490
The check, please.

926
01:16:10,833 --> 01:16:12,107
Take off your panties.

927
01:16:13,269 --> 01:16:14,509
Do it now.

928
01:16:17,206 --> 01:16:18,241
Right in here?

929
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:20,342
Yeah, right here. Now.

930
01:16:21,343 --> 01:16:22,515
Go on.

931
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:01,450
Hmm.

932
01:17:10,559 --> 01:17:11,629
Excuse me.

933
01:18:09,952 --> 01:18:10,953
Don't come.

934
01:18:45,154 --> 01:18:46,929
Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm. No.

935
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:50,226
Two minutes.
Are you kidding?

936
01:18:50,326 --> 01:18:51,999
In the bedroom.
Are you joking?

937
01:18:52,361 --> 01:18:53,567
Two minutes.

938
01:19:28,697 --> 01:19:30,040
What are you doing in here?

939
01:19:31,967 --> 01:19:33,446
You made me wait,

940
01:19:34,536 --> 01:19:35,981
so now it's your turn.

941
01:19:42,211 --> 01:19:43,554
Are you any good?

942
01:19:48,284 --> 01:19:49,888
Hmm. We'll see.

943
01:19:52,388 --> 01:19:53,958
Maybe we should make a bet.

944
01:19:55,057 --> 01:19:56,661
If I win,

945
01:19:59,428 --> 01:20:00,839
you take me to the red room.

946
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:03,738
And if I win?

947
01:20:05,768 --> 01:20:06,940
Your choice.

948
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:21,688
Break.

949
01:20:24,653 --> 01:20:25,927
Okay.

950
01:20:43,806 --> 01:20:45,183
Mmm. Solids.

951
01:21:38,494 --> 01:21:39,700
Oh, dear.

952
01:22:47,563 --> 01:22:49,065
Side pocket.

953
01:22:50,899 --> 01:22:52,742
Red room, here we come.

954
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:00,642
Oof.

955
01:23:00,742 --> 01:23:02,016
Shit.

956
01:23:02,911 --> 01:23:04,515
I hope you're not a sore loser.

957
01:23:06,949 --> 01:23:09,122
That depends on
how hard you spank me.

958
01:23:22,464 --> 01:23:24,341
I want to be
very rough with you.

959
01:23:24,433 --> 01:23:26,606
So be rough with me.

960
01:23:54,963 --> 01:23:57,842
And Jada needs someone
to sign off on the new Carusi.

961
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,144
I kept asking Jack to do that.

962
01:24:01,303 --> 01:24:03,146
Yeah, well, Jack was
kind of lazy.

963
01:24:03,305 --> 01:24:04,511
Didn't you notice?

964
01:24:04,673 --> 01:24:05,811
Yeah.

965
01:24:05,974 --> 01:24:08,318
I believe he called it
"artistic: Temperament."

966
01:24:11,847 --> 01:24:12,848
Thank you, Hannah.

967
01:24:13,682 --> 01:24:14,683
Yep.

968
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:19,821
<i>Hey.</i>

969
01:24:20,422 --> 01:24:22,732
It's great that
you're doing this, but...

970
01:24:22,824 --> 01:24:25,930
It's totally weird,
I know. I know.

971
01:24:26,428 --> 01:24:29,204
I mean, am I expected
to call you Miss Steele?

972
01:24:29,431 --> 01:24:31,843
I expect you to call me Ana.

973
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,207
And I don't expect you
to fetch me coffee

974
01:24:34,269 --> 01:24:36,772
unless you're getting
some for yourself.

975
01:24:38,941 --> 01:24:44,186
And the rest of it, we'll
just make up as we go, okay?

976
01:24:44,446 --> 01:24:45,618
Okay.

977
01:25:03,131 --> 01:25:04,269
Miss Steele.

978
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:09,241
Damn it.

979
01:25:10,238 --> 01:25:12,616
Take it. I'm just gonna grab
some stuff and check the mail.

980
01:25:12,708 --> 01:25:13,778
I should go up with you.

981
01:25:13,909 --> 01:25:15,411
No, it's okay.
I'll be two seconds.

982
01:25:15,644 --> 01:25:16,645
Take it.

983
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:19,881
Hey, Ros.

984
01:26:01,623 --> 01:26:02,693
Leila.

985
01:26:07,696 --> 01:26:09,539
Christian is downstairs.

986
01:26:10,999 --> 01:26:12,034
Do you wanna see him?

987
01:26:15,837 --> 01:26:17,783
I came to see you.

988
01:26:21,109 --> 01:26:22,110
Okay.

989
01:26:25,714 --> 01:26:27,387
He told me what happened.

990
01:26:31,453 --> 01:26:33,228
I know you're in a lot of pain.

991
01:26:35,057 --> 01:26:36,365
I'm so sorry.

992
01:26:37,459 --> 01:26:39,666
He lets you call him
by his name.

993
01:26:41,296 --> 01:26:44,300
He talks about you all the time.

994
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:46,208
He cares about you.

995
01:26:50,338 --> 01:26:51,715
Don't lie.

996
01:26:55,343 --> 01:26:57,186
Tell me what you have
that I don't.

997
01:26:58,380 --> 01:26:59,723
Nothing.

998
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:03,693
I'm nothing.

999
01:27:06,421 --> 01:27:07,729
He'll get tired of me.

1000
01:27:08,590 --> 01:27:10,501
Master sleeps in your bed.

1001
01:27:11,426 --> 01:27:13,838
How do you know that?
I saw you.

1002
01:27:14,930 --> 01:27:16,204
I watched you.

1003
01:27:17,432 --> 01:27:19,002
I know you love him.

1004
01:27:19,434 --> 01:27:20,777
I do, too.

1005
01:27:21,770 --> 01:27:22,908
We all do.

1006
01:27:24,272 --> 01:27:25,512
Why don't you put the gun down?

1007
01:27:25,607 --> 01:27:28,281
You don't know him
or what he likes.

1008
01:27:28,443 --> 01:27:30,763
You don't give him what he wants.
He's pretending with you.

1009
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:46,464
No, Christian.

1010
01:28:08,984 --> 01:28:09,985
Kneel.

1011
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:30,510
Ana...

1012
01:28:31,106 --> 01:28:33,916
Go to Escala.
Wait for me there.

1013
01:28:37,512 --> 01:28:40,356
For once, just do
as you're told.

1014
01:28:45,187 --> 01:28:47,098
Taylor, get her out of here.

1015
01:29:00,502 --> 01:29:01,708
Miss Steele.

1016
01:29:08,109 --> 01:29:10,111
Miss Steele. Ana!

1017
01:29:10,278 --> 01:29:11,655
Stop it, Taylor.

1018
01:30:39,935 --> 01:30:41,414
I don't care.

1019
01:30:42,537 --> 01:30:46,781
She's been gone for three hours, and she
doesn't have her cell or her purse.

1020
01:30:50,779 --> 01:30:52,258
Forget it. She's here.

1021
01:30:56,818 --> 01:30:58,729
Where the fuck have you been?

1022
01:31:01,790 --> 01:31:03,667
I told you to come
straight here.

1023
01:31:03,825 --> 01:31:06,066
I've had people out combing
the streets, looking for you.

1024
01:31:06,127 --> 01:31:08,733
I'm sorry I don't always
do as I'm told.

1025
01:31:09,331 --> 01:31:13,108
Maybe you just really need
someone who obeys every command.

1026
01:31:13,268 --> 01:31:14,508
Don't be ridiculous.

1027
01:31:14,669 --> 01:31:16,273
I saw you, Christian.

1028
01:31:16,438 --> 01:31:18,577
I saw the way
you were with Leila.

1029
01:31:18,740 --> 01:31:20,583
She had a gun, Ana.

1030
01:31:21,076 --> 01:31:22,749
I would have done
anything to subdue her.

1031
01:31:24,612 --> 01:31:26,250
Where is she now?

1032
01:31:27,148 --> 01:31:28,149
Is she here?

1033
01:31:28,249 --> 01:31:29,353
What?

1034
01:31:29,517 --> 01:31:30,928
No, of course not.

1035
01:31:31,086 --> 01:31:33,430
She's in the psych ward getting
the help that she needs.

1036
01:31:36,458 --> 01:31:38,938
Look, I know she scared you...

1037
01:31:39,094 --> 01:31:40,801
Yeah. She scared me.

1038
01:31:42,297 --> 01:31:44,538
But you scared me more.

1039
01:31:45,467 --> 01:31:47,845
Seeing you like that with her'

1040
01:31:48,003 --> 01:31:53,851
I'll never be able to give you that
kind of submission and obedience.

1041
01:31:54,309 --> 01:31:55,310
Ana.

1042
01:31:55,810 --> 01:31:58,620
Don't crowd me.
I need space.

1043
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:00,557
No, please don't do this.
Christian.

1044
01:32:00,648 --> 01:32:03,629
Don't give up on me. I just
need to think a little bit.

1045
01:32:04,185 --> 01:32:05,994
Don't leave me.

1046
01:32:09,391 --> 01:32:11,029
What are you doing?

1047
01:32:12,394 --> 01:32:13,566
Get up.

1048
01:32:16,965 --> 01:32:18,501
What are you doing?

1049
01:32:19,134 --> 01:32:20,374
Look at me.

1050
01:32:22,303 --> 01:32:23,509
Look at me.

1051
01:32:30,345 --> 01:32:31,688
I'm scared.

1052
01:32:36,484 --> 01:32:38,896
I know you say that I'm enough.

1053
01:32:42,090 --> 01:32:44,866
But there are certain things
that you are used to getting

1054
01:32:45,193 --> 01:32:49,198
that I will never, ever,
ever be able to give you.

1055
01:32:51,533 --> 01:32:55,071
And it might be fine
for right now,

1056
01:32:55,837 --> 01:32:58,249
but what's gonna happen when
you start needing them again?

1057
01:32:58,339 --> 01:32:59,340
I won't.

1058
01:32:59,507 --> 01:33:01,111
How do you know that?

1059
01:33:01,276 --> 01:33:02,346
How can I believe you?

1060
01:33:02,510 --> 01:33:04,547
I don't even understand
your need to dominate.

1061
01:33:04,612 --> 01:33:06,455
I'm not a Dominant.

1062
01:33:07,182 --> 01:33:08,388
I'm not.

1063
01:33:09,384 --> 01:33:11,386
The right term is a sadist.

1064
01:33:12,754 --> 01:33:15,394
I get off on punishing women.
Women who look like you...

1065
01:33:15,457 --> 01:33:17,130
Like your mother.

1066
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:19,761
Yes.

1067
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:22,871
And I know
how fucked up that is.

1068
01:33:23,898 --> 01:33:25,241
When you left,

1069
01:33:26,134 --> 01:33:30,549
I swore that I would stop it if
that's what it took to get you back.

1070
01:33:31,806 --> 01:33:33,717
But I'm done with it.

1071
01:33:34,709 --> 01:33:37,656
You mean more to me
than anything else.

1072
01:33:40,748 --> 01:33:43,786
I wanna
believe you. I do.

1073
01:33:43,885 --> 01:33:45,125
But I can't.

1074
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:46,756
Ana, give me your hand.

1075
01:33:50,658 --> 01:33:52,001
This is me.

1076
01:33:53,895 --> 01:33:55,135
All of me.

1077
01:33:56,297 --> 01:33:57,298
Christian.

1078
01:33:57,465 --> 01:33:59,172
And I'm all yours.

1079
01:35:01,563 --> 01:35:02,564
No.

1080
01:35:06,401 --> 01:35:07,402
No!

1081
01:35:08,970 --> 01:35:11,382
Hey. Hey, hey.
No.

1082
01:35:11,539 --> 01:35:13,519
It's okay.
I'm right here.

1083
01:35:14,342 --> 01:35:15,821
I'm right here.

1084
01:35:21,049 --> 01:35:22,153
Marry me.

1085
01:35:24,152 --> 01:35:25,152
What?

1086
01:35:25,186 --> 01:35:26,927
I want you to marry me.

1087
01:35:30,058 --> 01:35:32,436
Christian, I think
you're dreaming.

1088
01:36:36,624 --> 01:36:37,796
Good morning.

1089
01:36:38,293 --> 01:36:39,328
Morning.

1090
01:36:43,131 --> 01:36:44,303
Sleep okay?

1091
01:36:45,066 --> 01:36:47,012
I did. You?

1092
01:36:47,435 --> 01:36:49,847
Like a log.
Out all night.

1093
01:36:49,937 --> 01:36:50,938
Hmm.

1094
01:36:54,409 --> 01:36:59,518
You didn't have any
weird dreams or anything?

1095
01:37:00,348 --> 01:37:02,294
Or, like, wake up at all?

1096
01:37:02,450 --> 01:37:03,451
No.

1097
01:37:04,319 --> 01:37:05,821
I mean,
none that I can think of.

1098
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:06,921
Hmm.

1099
01:37:07,855 --> 01:37:10,426
I mean, there was a little thing
of asking you to marry me,

1100
01:37:10,491 --> 01:37:12,368
but aside from that, no.
Nothing.

1101
01:37:12,460 --> 01:37:14,531
Don't mess with me like that.

1102
01:37:14,696 --> 01:37:17,609
No? How should I
mess with you?

1103
01:37:18,132 --> 01:37:20,043
Like this? Huh?

1104
01:37:21,202 --> 01:37:22,374
Is that better?

1105
01:37:27,775 --> 01:37:28,981
I meant it.

1106
01:37:30,611 --> 01:37:32,386
I wanna marry you.

1107
01:37:33,381 --> 01:37:34,485
Why?

1108
01:37:35,983 --> 01:37:40,489
Because I wanna spend every second
of the rest of my life with you.

1109
01:37:47,662 --> 01:37:50,506
I don't expect you
to say yes right away.

1110
01:37:51,666 --> 01:37:53,009
I know I'm complicated.

1111
01:37:55,336 --> 01:37:58,010
Just a little bit.

1112
01:38:01,909 --> 01:38:03,320
You have an assistant?

1113
01:38:03,344 --> 01:38:05,085
I thought you were an assistant.

1114
01:38:06,381 --> 01:38:08,588
It's a long story.
What's going on?

1115
01:38:08,683 --> 01:38:11,027
<i>What do I get Christian
for his birthday?</i>

1116
01:38:11,185 --> 01:38:14,723
The boy already has everything
except a sense of humor.

1117
01:38:14,856 --> 01:38:15,857
Uh...

1118
01:38:17,358 --> 01:38:19,201
His birthday?
When is his birthday?

1119
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:22,204
<i>Sunday. He didn't tell you?
He is so weird.</i>

1120
01:38:22,530 --> 01:38:24,203
Mom and Dad
are throwing him a party.

1121
01:38:24,365 --> 01:38:25,605
Didn't they just have a party?

1122
01:38:25,767 --> 01:38:27,542
Jeez, you're <i>as bad</i> as he is.

1123
01:38:27,702 --> 01:38:28,703
That was a ball.

1124
01:38:28,870 --> 01:38:31,714
This is just family, friends,
music, fireworks.

1125
01:38:31,873 --> 01:38:34,285
No biggie.
Hey, what about a tie?

1126
01:38:34,375 --> 01:38:36,116
Uh, uh...

1127
01:38:36,210 --> 01:38:38,053
Christian has a lot of ties.

1128
01:38:38,212 --> 01:38:40,556
<i>Socks, suspenders? Throw me a bone here?</i>

1129
01:38:40,615 --> 01:38:41,616
Um, oh...

1130
01:38:41,716 --> 01:38:43,252
God, Mia, I gotta go.

1131
01:38:43,418 --> 01:38:47,059
Okay, okay. But Sunday, or I'll
hunt you down myself. Bye.

1132
01:38:49,690 --> 01:38:51,636
Ooh, perfect.

1133
01:38:59,734 --> 01:39:00,906
Do you have a gift box?

1134
01:39:00,968 --> 01:39:02,038
One second.

1135
01:39:05,973 --> 01:39:06,974
Hey.

1136
01:39:14,081 --> 01:39:15,583
Miss Steele.
Hmm.

1137
01:39:15,650 --> 01:39:16,754
How was your day?

1138
01:39:17,218 --> 01:39:19,164
Looking up, Mr. Grey.

1139
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:20,560
Where's Taylor?

1140
01:39:20,721 --> 01:39:22,598
He went to get my bag.

1141
01:39:22,757 --> 01:39:24,930
Your bag?
Where are you going?

1142
01:39:25,092 --> 01:39:27,936
Ros and I have to go to
Portland for some meetings.

1143
01:39:28,095 --> 01:39:29,438
I'll be back tomorrow night.

1144
01:39:30,398 --> 01:39:31,570
Come on.

1145
01:39:32,767 --> 01:39:35,179
When were you going to tell
me about your birthday?

1146
01:39:37,405 --> 01:39:40,249
Your parents are
throwing you a party.

1147
01:39:40,408 --> 01:39:42,115
Were we just gonna stay home?

1148
01:39:42,910 --> 01:39:44,787
They do this every year.

1149
01:39:44,846 --> 01:39:46,257
Um, yeah. Birthday.

1150
01:39:48,416 --> 01:39:52,626
My, uh, arrival in the world isn't
something I feel like celebrating.

1151
01:39:53,287 --> 01:39:55,858
Well, I feel like
celebrating it.

1152
01:39:58,259 --> 01:40:00,296
Can't open it
till the day though.

1153
01:40:02,296 --> 01:40:03,866
Then why give it to me now?

1154
01:40:05,366 --> 01:40:07,642
Cali it delayed gratification.

1155
01:41:12,667 --> 01:41:15,614
Is that...
ls that Mount St. Helens?

1156
01:41:17,204 --> 01:41:19,775
I changed the flight plan,
get us home sooner.

1157
01:41:21,542 --> 01:41:24,614
Great. You realize
that's a volcano, right?

1158
01:41:25,112 --> 01:41:28,252
Relax, Ros. If it goes up,
you'll have a ringside seat.

1159
01:41:28,349 --> 01:41:29,350
Ah.

1160
01:41:29,884 --> 01:41:31,295
Lucky me.

1161
01:41:42,396 --> 01:41:43,602
Christian, what is that?

1162
01:41:43,698 --> 01:41:44,802
Don't worry.

1163
01:41:48,903 --> 01:41:50,712
Oh, my God! Christian!

1164
01:41:51,706 --> 01:41:52,741
Shit.

1165
01:41:57,244 --> 01:41:59,281
Shit. Christian,
what is going on?

1166
01:41:59,380 --> 01:42:01,621
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!
What is happening?

1167
01:42:04,385 --> 01:42:05,557
Damn it.
Oh, my God.

1168
01:42:06,220 --> 01:42:07,426
Oh, my God, Christian!

1169
01:42:14,295 --> 01:42:15,399
Stop it!

1170
01:42:28,976 --> 01:42:30,284
Christian!

1171
01:42:41,022 --> 01:42:42,342
There.
There, there, there, there!

1172
01:43:09,050 --> 01:43:10,222
Oh, you remember this guy?

1173
01:43:10,384 --> 01:43:11,488
Kate!

1174
01:43:15,389 --> 01:43:16,390
Hi!

1175
01:43:16,490 --> 01:43:20,131
Oh, my God!
You're so tan and glowy.

1176
01:43:20,327 --> 01:43:21,397
You want a beer, Ana?

1177
01:43:21,562 --> 01:43:23,007
Yes! Please. Please.

1178
01:43:23,497 --> 01:43:24,532
Hi, José.
Hey.

1179
01:43:24,699 --> 01:43:26,701
Hi! How's it going?

1180
01:43:26,867 --> 01:43:29,711
So? Congratulations,
Fiction Editor.

1181
01:43:29,870 --> 01:43:31,850
Right?
She's a big deal now.

1182
01:43:32,006 --> 01:43:33,815
And how's, uh, your hottie?

1183
01:43:34,675 --> 01:43:36,518
Uh, Christian is good.

1184
01:43:36,577 --> 01:43:38,022
Um, uh...

1185
01:43:38,079 --> 01:43:39,581
He asked me to move in with him.

1186
01:43:40,681 --> 01:43:41,819
What?

1187
01:43:41,982 --> 01:43:43,518
Ana's moving in with Christian.

1188
01:43:43,584 --> 01:43:44,722
Oh, that's great.

1189
01:43:44,885 --> 01:43:46,990
You know, we could
use the privacy.

1190
01:43:47,588 --> 01:43:49,932
He's so subtle, it kills me.

1191
01:43:50,091 --> 01:43:51,161
Stop.

1192
01:43:52,393 --> 01:43:54,896
So you're serious. But are you happy?

1193
01:43:54,995 --> 01:43:56,440
'Cause that's all I care about.

1194
01:43:56,597 --> 01:43:59,942
I mean, it's complicated,
but I've never been happier.

1195
01:44:00,067 --> 01:44:01,068
Hey, Mia, what's up?

1196
01:44:01,869 --> 01:44:05,248
Did you hear about José's show?
It was incredible.

1197
01:44:05,406 --> 01:44:06,749
Really. He was amazing.

1198
01:44:06,907 --> 01:44:08,547
He got rave reviews.
I gotta check it oui.

1199
01:44:08,709 --> 01:44:10,620
Wait, wait, Mia.
Slow down.

1200
01:44:11,846 --> 01:44:14,520
Shit. Okay. Yeah, yeah,
we're on our way.

1201
01:44:15,349 --> 01:44:19,195
Um, Christian's chopper went missing
on the way back from Portland.

1202
01:44:19,353 --> 01:44:21,594
They're sending out
search parties right now.

1203
01:44:22,456 --> 01:44:24,094
Come on, let's go.

No, please. Leave it on.

Thank you.

1224
01:45:21,916 --> 01:45:23,452

1225

We haven't had any time.

1226
01:45:30,124 --> 01:45:32,468
We need to have more time.

1227

You're going to have
plenty of time.

We're so glad that
you're here with us

and in Christian's life.

1230

You've made such
a difference to him.

1231
01:45:48,709 --> 01:45:55,024
He never let anyone get
close until you came along.

1232

Grace, he adores you.

but children grow apart from
their parents, and that's fine,

1235
01:46:05,459 --> 01:46:07,405
as long as they're happy.

1236
01:46:08,128 --> 01:46:13,407
And he is happy with you.

1237
01:46:15,002 --> 01:46:16,811
And that's all I ever wanted.

1238
01:46:17,404 --> 01:46:18,648

Christian!
How did you get here?

1244
01:46:35,422 --> 01:46:36,594
Later, Mia.

1245
01:46:37,091 --> 01:46:39,765
What happened? Oh, my God!
Why didn't you call?

1246
01:46:39,927 --> 01:46:41,727
I had an accident.
I lost my phone.

1247

We know.
It's been all over the news.

1248

I'm fine.
Ros is fine.

1249
01:46:45,699 --> 01:46:48,737
Dad, he's here.
He just walked in.

1250
01:46:48,869 --> 01:46:51,076
I'm okay. He looks like shit,
but he's in one piece.

1251
01:46:51,171 --> 01:46:52,946
- No, he doesn't.
- Yeah, he does.

Come here, man.

1254
01:46:57,411 --> 01:46:59,084
Okay. Need to say hi to my girl.

1255
01:46:59,179 --> 01:47:00,180
Come on, Mom.

1256
01:47:03,517 --> 01:47:04,928
- I need a drink.
- Me, too.

1257
01:47:04,952 --> 01:47:06,090
Miss me?

1258
01:47:17,598 --> 01:47:18,633
Oh, my God.

1259
01:47:22,036 --> 01:47:24,710
I thought...
Hey, hey, Ana...

1260
01:47:24,772 --> 01:47:27,548
It's all right.
Ana, I'm here.

1261
01:47:27,708 --> 01:47:31,053
I was so scared.
I was so scared.

1262
01:47:35,382 --> 01:47:37,157
I thought I lost you forever.

1263
01:47:38,085 --> 01:47:39,723
Not a chance.

1264
01:47:40,721 --> 01:47:41,722
I'm here.

1265
01:47:46,660 --> 01:47:48,606
That's when
all my instruments lit up.

1266
01:47:49,330 --> 01:47:52,334
- Had a fire in the tail, lost both engines.
- Both of them?

1267
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:55,402
Yeah. Thank you.

1268
01:47:57,738 --> 01:48:00,685
I tried to find somewhere safe
to land, but it was all trees.

1269
01:48:00,774 --> 01:48:04,984
We hit them pretty hard, but luckily we
were both able to crawl out of there.

1270
01:48:05,412 --> 01:48:07,119
Thank goodness.

1271
01:48:08,782 --> 01:48:10,125
Thank God.

1272
01:48:12,786 --> 01:48:14,595
Sorry, guys, but
I gotta take off.

1273
01:48:15,522 --> 01:48:16,762
Okay.

1274
01:48:17,958 --> 01:48:21,838
José, thanks for being here.
Means the world to Ana.

1275
01:48:21,929 --> 01:48:24,102
Of course.
Hey...

1276
01:48:24,598 --> 01:48:27,044
Welcome home, Mr. Grey.
Christian, please.

1277
01:48:28,535 --> 01:48:31,778
Well, it's late, and these
two should get some rest.

1278
01:48:32,172 --> 01:48:33,947
Grace, shall we'?
Yes.

1279
01:48:34,008 --> 01:48:35,518
Yeah, I think we're gonna
head home too, bro.

1280
01:48:35,542 --> 01:48:36,646
Cool.

1281
01:48:36,710 --> 01:48:38,383
We'll walk you guy's.

1282
01:48:40,614 --> 01:48:44,118
Kinda hate to say this, but your guy's
all right.

1283
01:48:44,184 --> 01:48:47,290
I'm glad he's okay,
and I'm glad you're happy.

1284
01:48:47,721 --> 01:48:51,032
Thank you. Will we be seeing
you tomorrow at his party?

1285
01:48:51,125 --> 01:48:53,071
Don't push it.

1286
01:48:56,497 --> 01:48:57,567
Come here.

1287
01:48:59,833 --> 01:49:00,903
Careful.

1288
01:49:01,068 --> 01:49:02,513
I know.

1289
01:49:02,669 --> 01:49:04,478
Mom.
Okay.

1290
01:49:07,374 --> 01:49:08,494
We'll see you tomorrow, Ana.

1291
01:49:08,642 --> 01:49:09,643
Good night.

1292
01:49:16,417 --> 01:49:17,691
It's after midnight.

1293
01:49:18,719 --> 01:49:20,357
I'm not tired.

1294
01:49:20,521 --> 01:49:21,591
No.

1295
01:49:22,489 --> 01:49:23,729
It's your birthday.

1296
01:49:26,427 --> 01:49:27,838
Yeah.

1297
01:49:29,730 --> 01:49:31,004
Happy birthday.

1298
01:49:31,865 --> 01:49:33,003
Thank you.

1299
01:49:36,170 --> 01:49:38,616
Do you still have
that gift I gave you?

1300
01:49:40,774 --> 01:49:41,775
Yes.

1301
01:49:53,387 --> 01:49:55,264
You know you didn't have to.

1302
01:49:56,223 --> 01:49:57,566
All I want is you.

1303
01:49:57,724 --> 01:49:59,397
Just open it.

1304
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:00,795
Okay.

1305
01:50:07,401 --> 01:50:08,880
Keychain.

1306
01:50:09,036 --> 01:50:10,777
Turn it over.

1307
01:50:20,614 --> 01:50:22,651
Does this mean yes, yes?

1308
01:50:22,816 --> 01:50:23,988
Yes.

1309
01:50:24,718 --> 01:50:25,992
Yes, yes, yes.

1310
01:50:33,160 --> 01:50:34,332
Wait!

1311
01:50:35,596 --> 01:50:37,735
So this whole time I had
the answer in my pocket?

1312
01:50:40,901 --> 01:50:42,471
Anastasia Steele...

1313
01:50:42,803 --> 01:50:44,942
What am I gonna do with you?

1314
01:51:16,637 --> 01:51:18,548
Take me to the red room.

1315
01:51:18,705 --> 01:51:19,843
Take me...

1316
01:51:20,007 --> 01:51:21,384
Take me to the red room.

1317
01:51:22,142 --> 01:51:23,519
Are you sure?
Yes.

1318
01:51:24,611 --> 01:51:25,612
Yes.

1319
01:54:01,468 --> 01:54:02,845
I love you.

1320
01:54:10,377 --> 01:54:11,879
Well, I love you.

1321
01:54:13,347 --> 01:54:16,157
Hello?
Mom? Hi.

1322
01:54:16,717 --> 01:54:20,290
Ana, sweetheart.
Where have you been?

1323
01:54:21,121 --> 01:54:25,194
I know. I've been... I'm sorry.
Work has been so crazy.

1324
01:54:25,625 --> 01:54:27,502
I hope they're not
overworking you?

1325
01:54:27,861 --> 01:54:31,206
No, no. It's actually...
It's going really well.

1326
01:54:31,998 --> 01:54:37,311
Urn, but I was calling because I, um... I
wanted to talk to you about Christian.

1327
01:54:37,804 --> 01:54:40,182
Christian?
You've heard from him?

1328
01:54:40,407 --> 01:54:43,513
Yeah. We got back together.

1329
01:54:44,177 --> 01:54:50,150
Honey, that's wonderful! This time
it's going to last. I know it is.

1330
01:54:50,984 --> 01:54:54,158
I hope you're right,
because, urn...

1331
01:54:54,988 --> 01:54:59,232
He asked me to marry him,
and I said yes.

1332
01:55:05,232 --> 01:55:06,336
Mom?

1333
01:55:07,200 --> 01:55:10,181
You're not...
No, no, I'm not pregnant.

1334
01:55:11,004 --> 01:55:12,005
Um...

1335
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:16,514
I know that we haven't
been together very long,

1336
01:55:20,113 --> 01:55:22,354
but I love him so much.

1337
01:55:25,352 --> 01:55:26,888
He's the one.

1338
01:55:27,087 --> 01:55:30,557
Oh, sweetheart!
I'm so happy for you!

1339
01:55:30,791 --> 01:55:32,930
<i>You are?
Of course.</i>

1340
01:55:33,026 --> 01:55:35,563
You've always
known your own mind.

1341
01:55:35,629 --> 01:55:39,702
If that man is the love of your
life, you grab him with both hands.

1342
01:55:41,535 --> 01:55:42,912
Thanks, Mama.

1343
01:55:43,036 --> 01:55:46,381
Have you called Ray?
Um, no, not yet.

1344
01:55:46,773 --> 01:55:50,778
Um... Christian did, though.
He asked for his permission.

1345
01:55:50,877 --> 01:55:55,155
He asked for your hand?
That's so chivalrous.

1346
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:21,641
Hey.

1347
01:56:22,476 --> 01:56:23,477
Hey.

1348
01:56:23,844 --> 01:56:24,914
Champagne, Mr. Grey?

1349
01:56:25,078 --> 01:56:26,318
Thanks, Gretchen.

1350
01:56:26,480 --> 01:56:29,518
And can I just say,
happy birthday?

1351
01:56:30,016 --> 01:56:31,757
Sure. Thank you.

1352
01:56:35,155 --> 01:56:36,828
Christian.
Mom.

1353
01:56:37,591 --> 01:56:38,968
Happy birthday.
Thank you.

1354
01:56:40,327 --> 01:56:41,431
And Ana.
Hi.

1355
01:56:41,495 --> 01:56:43,338
It's so good to see you again.

1356
01:56:43,497 --> 01:56:45,943
You saw us last night.

1357
01:56:45,999 --> 01:56:47,000
Yes.

1358
01:56:47,167 --> 01:56:48,441
And because of that

1359
01:56:48,602 --> 01:56:52,311
lam never taking anything for granted.
Ever again.

1360
01:56:52,606 --> 01:56:53,812
Hey!

1361
01:56:53,974 --> 01:56:55,885
I heard about the crash.
Are you okay?

1362
01:56:55,976 --> 01:56:57,717
I'm fine, Elena.
Thank you.

1363
01:56:57,811 --> 01:56:59,188
Oh!

1364
01:56:59,279 --> 01:57:02,988
Ana, let me introduce to you,
my good friend, Elena Lincoln.

1365
01:57:03,149 --> 01:57:05,060
We met at the masquerade.

1366
01:57:05,218 --> 01:57:07,562
Yes.
Nice to see you again.

1367
01:57:09,789 --> 01:57:10,790
Excuse us.

1368
01:57:10,957 --> 01:57:11,992
Surely.

1369
01:57:12,826 --> 01:57:14,066
She's fantastic.

1370
01:57:22,502 --> 01:57:24,140
Ladies, gentlemen. Mia.

1371
01:57:26,573 --> 01:57:29,645
I wanna thank you all
for coming here this evening.

1372
01:57:29,809 --> 01:57:31,409
I was expecting
a small family gathering.

1373
01:57:31,478 --> 01:57:32,752
Thanks, Mia.

1374
01:57:33,213 --> 01:57:34,533
But I'm happy
that you're all here

1375
01:57:34,581 --> 01:57:36,993
because I have
an announcement to make.

1376
01:57:37,984 --> 01:57:42,364
As most of you know, yesterday
Ros and I had a narrow escape.

1377
01:57:43,523 --> 01:57:47,403
And something like that reminds
us of what really matters

1378
01:57:47,561 --> 01:57:49,939
and how important it is
to seize the day.

1379
01:57:50,997 --> 01:57:54,444
We should cherish the people we
care about and who care about us.

1380
01:57:55,769 --> 01:58:01,344
Mom, Dad, I know I haven't
always been the perfect son.

1381
01:58:02,375 --> 01:58:05,720
But I owe everything
to you both, so thank you.

1382
01:58:12,619 --> 01:58:14,223
But that's not the announcement.

1383
01:58:14,588 --> 01:58:17,694
Ana, come up here
a second, please.

1384
01:58:27,767 --> 01:58:31,408
So, a while ago, I was lucky enough
to meet this amazing young woman,

1385
01:58:31,571 --> 01:58:33,141
Anastasia Steele.

1386
01:58:33,573 --> 01:58:36,417
And very quickly, I realized
that she was the one

1387
01:58:36,476 --> 01:58:37,921
I wanted to share my life with.

1388
01:58:38,745 --> 01:58:42,750
So I asked her to marry
me, and she said yes.

1389
01:58:43,550 --> 01:58:45,962
Oh! That is so...

1390
01:58:57,130 --> 01:58:58,768
lam thrilled, Ana.

1391
01:58:59,766 --> 01:59:01,744
- Welcome to the family.
- Thank you.

1392
01:59:01,768 --> 01:59:04,977
If I cry any more, I'm
just going to dehydrate.

1393
01:59:05,138 --> 01:59:06,515
Oh, my God!
Don't do that.

1394
01:59:06,673 --> 01:59:07,777
Congratulations.

1395
01:59:07,941 --> 01:59:09,079
Stop crying, Mom.

1396
01:59:09,242 --> 01:59:10,778
Can't help it.
I love you so much.

1397
01:59:10,944 --> 01:59:12,150
I love you.

1398
01:59:12,746 --> 01:59:15,283
Hi! Well done,
big brother!

1399
01:59:16,483 --> 01:59:18,156
Ring! Show me the ring.

1400
01:59:18,985 --> 01:59:20,362
Oh, we're gonna
choose it together.

1401
01:59:20,520 --> 01:59:23,160
No rock.
Christian Grey.

1402
01:59:23,623 --> 01:59:25,762
Oh, my God!
I have a sister!

1403
01:59:38,505 --> 01:59:41,281
I leave you alone for a couple
weeks, and this is what happens?

1404
01:59:41,341 --> 01:59:43,844
I know! I'm sorry
I didn't tell you.

1405
01:59:44,010 --> 01:59:45,512
Oh, please. Come here.

1406
01:59:46,179 --> 01:59:48,284
Oh!

1407
01:59:48,515 --> 01:59:52,156
So, how does it feel to bag
Seattle's most eligible bachelor?

1408
01:59:52,318 --> 01:59:54,195
It's a little scary, but...

1409
01:59:54,354 --> 01:59:56,391
Well, if anyone can
make it work, it's you.

1410
01:59:57,023 --> 01:59:58,866
Hey, sis-in-law!

1411
01:59:59,693 --> 02:00:02,572
Congratulations. Christian's
a very lucky guy.

1412
02:00:03,329 --> 02:00:06,799
You, however, are certifiably insane.

1413
02:00:06,866 --> 02:00:08,038
I'm sorry to interrupt

1414
02:00:08,201 --> 02:00:10,081
Mia wants to taste one of
your killer cocktails.

1415
02:00:10,203 --> 02:00:12,205
Oh, well, coming right up.

1416
02:00:14,040 --> 02:00:16,577
I see you heeded
our little talk.

1417
02:00:22,182 --> 02:00:24,389
What makes you think
I would ever listen to you?

1418
02:00:24,551 --> 02:00:26,553
You don't care about Christian.

1419
02:00:26,720 --> 02:00:27,892
He'll see that.

1420
02:00:28,054 --> 02:00:29,533
I'll make sure of it.

1421
02:00:29,689 --> 02:00:31,566
He'll see right through you.

1422
02:00:32,726 --> 02:00:34,603
It's over for you, Elena.

1423
02:00:34,894 --> 02:00:37,932
You're just a mousy little
thing after his money.

1424
02:00:38,098 --> 02:00:40,408
He's not capable of marriage.

1425
02:00:47,240 --> 02:00:48,583
Thank you, Christian.

1426
02:00:49,075 --> 02:00:50,782
Why are you even here, Elena?

1427
02:00:51,778 --> 02:00:53,257
She's not right for you.

1428
02:00:53,413 --> 02:00:55,256
You don't know
what's right for me.

1429
02:00:55,415 --> 02:00:57,452
You taught me
how to fuck, Elena.

1430
02:00:57,617 --> 02:00:59,096
Ana taught me how to love.

1431
02:00:59,252 --> 02:01:01,926
She's just the next one in line.

1432
02:01:02,555 --> 02:01:04,262
Get out of my house.

1433
02:01:08,294 --> 02:01:12,071
Leave my children alone, and
get the hell out of my house.

1434
02:01:24,811 --> 02:01:26,290
Ana, darling...

1435
02:01:28,948 --> 02:01:31,656
Would you give us
a moment alone' please?

1436
02:02:00,847 --> 02:02:01,985
I'm sorry about that

1437
02:02:06,319 --> 02:02:07,525
ls your mom okay?

1438
02:02:08,822 --> 02:02:10,631
Furious.
Hmm.

1439
02:02:11,457 --> 02:02:12,959
Elena's gone.

1440
02:02:13,793 --> 02:02:15,136
Like, gone, gone?

1441
02:02:15,295 --> 02:02:16,467
I'm done.

1442
02:02:16,830 --> 02:02:18,867
The business. Everything.

1443
02:02:19,032 --> 02:02:21,535
I'll have my people sort
out the details tomorrow.

1444
02:02:23,670 --> 02:02:26,048
I know she was important to you.

1445
02:02:26,472 --> 02:02:27,678
I'm sorry.

1446
02:02:30,009 --> 02:02:31,009
Are you?

1447
02:02:31,044 --> 02:02:32,352
No.
No.

1448
02:02:35,849 --> 02:02:37,192
What's that you got there?

1449
02:02:52,232 --> 02:02:55,008
Come with me. There's
something I need to show you.

1450
02:02:58,204 --> 02:03:01,344
Last time we came down here,
I was over your shoulder.

1451
02:03:02,041 --> 02:03:03,145
Oh, yeah.

1452
02:03:20,226 --> 02:03:21,569
After you.

1453
02:03:33,373 --> 02:03:34,909
Oh, my God!

1454
02:03:36,743 --> 02:03:38,017
You wanted hearts and flowers.

1455
02:03:38,177 --> 02:03:39,212
Oh, my God!

1456
02:03:39,279 --> 02:03:40,280
It's okay.

1457
02:03:40,747 --> 02:03:42,021
It's okay.

1458
02:03:48,354 --> 02:03:49,594
Christian“.

1459
02:03:52,425 --> 02:03:54,098
This is amazing.

1460
02:04:01,434 --> 02:04:02,777
Be mine.

1461
02:04:04,437 --> 02:04:06,041
Share my life with me.

1462
02:04:07,874 --> 02:04:08,944
Yes.

1463
02:04:09,542 --> 02:04:10,612
Marry me.

I'll marry you.

Give me your hand.

Great, isn't it'?
That's so pretty.

Oh!
