1
00:00:50,577 --> 00:00:54,534
<i>Anastasia, I vow to
love you faithfully</i>

2
00:00:54,569 --> 00:00:56,619
<i>forsaking all others.</i>

3
00:00:56,926 --> 00:01:00,277
<i>I promise to love, to trust</i>

4
00:01:00,312 --> 00:01:02,386
<i>and to respect you.</i>

5
00:01:02,421 --> 00:01:06,254
<i>To comfort you in times of
need and keep you safe.</i>

6
00:01:08,288 --> 00:01:11,245
<i>All that I have
is now yours.</i>

7
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,686
<i>Fifty shades freed.</i>

8
00:01:13,892 --> 00:01:16,303
<i>I give you my hand to my heart.</i>

9
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:19,031
<i>For as long as we both shall live.</i>

10
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:28,024
Christian, I vow to be
your faithful partner

11
00:01:28,084 --> 00:01:30,637
in sickness and health,
I promise

12
00:01:30,672 --> 00:01:33,564
to love you unconditionally.

13
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:36,225
To honor and respect you.

14
00:01:36,486 --> 00:01:39,387
To bring you solace
in times of need.

15
00:01:39,679 --> 00:01:42,362
I promise to cherish you

16
00:01:43,202 --> 00:01:45,375
as long as we both shall live.

17
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,520
<i>I now pronounce you
man and wife.</i>

18
00:01:49,555 --> 00:01:51,249
You may kiss the bride.

19
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,046
Mrs. Gray?

20
00:02:45,246 --> 00:02:47,340
That's me.

21
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,326
Yeah, you.

22
00:02:49,805 --> 00:02:53,124
Let's get out of here.

23
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:21,877
You own this?

24
00:03:21,977 --> 00:03:23,589
We own this.

25
00:03:25,731 --> 00:03:28,513
Mrs. Grey, Mr. Grey.

26
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,275
<i>I didn't sleep last night.</i>

27
00:05:18,374 --> 00:05:21,705
<i>Don't count on any tonight either.</i>

28
00:05:24,046 --> 00:05:26,183
Will you put some of
this in my back?

29
00:05:26,218 --> 00:05:27,874
If you insist.

30
00:05:33,614 --> 00:05:36,160
- Take off the whole thing.
- Not a chance.

31
00:05:36,815 --> 00:05:39,716
- Why?
- You're showing plenty as it is.

32
00:05:42,555 --> 00:05:44,884
I am wearing more
than any woman here.

33
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:45,736
You want to be goggle by every

34
00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:47,955
guy in the beach...
Including Taylor?

35
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,273
When's Taylor gonna get a vacation?

36
00:05:53,474 --> 00:05:54,777
We need security.

37
00:05:54,796 --> 00:05:57,271
- On the beach, why?
- Because we do.

38
00:05:58,656 --> 00:06:00,250
You are done.

39
00:06:01,747 --> 00:06:04,510
I'm gonna go for a swim.
You coming?

40
00:06:06,176 --> 00:06:08,235
I'm right behind you.

41
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:28,385
Here you go sir.

42
00:06:44,555 --> 00:06:46,451
<i>"Access granted"</i>

43
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:14,019
What the hell are you doing?

44
00:07:15,214 --> 00:07:17,900
I must have turned over in my sleep.

45
00:07:17,935 --> 00:07:19,603
Yeah, it's not funny.

46
00:07:19,638 --> 00:07:22,162
Come on,
it's a little funny.

47
00:07:24,362 --> 00:07:26,522
Christian, look around. There is nothing

48
00:07:26,722 --> 00:07:28,558
but boobs for as far as I can see.

49
00:07:29,052 --> 00:07:30,666
Boobs in boob land.

50
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:32,905
Nobody cares about mine.

51
00:07:32,906 --> 00:07:36,040
They will when they are on the
cover of some sleazy tabloid.

52
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,289
Alright?

53
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,822
We are going back to the boat.

54
00:08:09,249 --> 00:08:13,204
You insist on defying me Mrs. Grey.

55
00:08:14,726 --> 00:08:16,838
What should I do about that?

56
00:08:17,993 --> 00:08:19,831
Learn to live with it.

57
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,022
It's not my style.

58
00:08:24,932 --> 00:08:27,291
How come you
always braid my hair?

59
00:08:27,526 --> 00:08:28,527
Hush.

60
00:08:29,145 --> 00:08:31,634
Do you remember
your safe word?

61
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:35,970
- Purple.
- Anna.

62
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,198
Red.

63
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,759
Good.

64
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,786
Lift up your arms.

65
00:09:04,534 --> 00:09:07,237
Tomorrow I'm gonna call this deal.

66
00:09:39,536 --> 00:09:41,943
Don't pull.
Don't bite.

67
00:10:03,206 --> 00:10:06,751
- Do you love me?
- You know, I love you.

68
00:10:08,936 --> 00:10:13,507
- Then why do you defy me?
- Because I can.

69
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:31,217
I should misbehave more often.

70
00:10:31,252 --> 00:10:33,288
Yeah, maybe you should.

71
00:10:36,621 --> 00:10:37,675
Hey Ross. What's up?

72
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,088
I'm sorry to interrupt
your honeymoon.

73
00:10:40,123 --> 00:10:42,366
We had a fire in the main
server room this morning.

74
00:10:42,401 --> 00:10:43,552
Was any one injured?

75
00:10:43,652 --> 00:10:45,205
No, and the damage could
have been much worse.

76
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,499
The fire suppressant system kicked in.

77
00:10:47,534 --> 00:10:49,103
It looks like Arsen.

78
00:10:49,138 --> 00:10:51,278
Someone planted an explosive device.

79
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:56,106
This guy... Security is sweeping
the room for fingerprints and DNA.

80
00:10:56,141 --> 00:10:57,182
Did he get any data?

81
00:10:57,382 --> 00:10:59,141
He took some of your personal files

82
00:10:59,341 --> 00:11:01,752
and then he might have set
the fire to cover his tracks.

83
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:03,303
Can you go back?

84
00:11:06,136 --> 00:11:08,928
Oh, my God.
That's Jack.

85
00:11:08,963 --> 00:11:11,375
- Who's Jack?
- Jack Hyde

86
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:14,088
- A formerly of SIP.
- He was my boss.

87
00:11:14,123 --> 00:11:16,151
Not any more,
he's been dealt with.

88
00:11:17,228 --> 00:11:19,258
I'm sorry, we need to go home.

89
00:11:19,293 --> 00:11:22,823
Ross, can you tell Andrea I need
the jet in Nise tomorrow please?

90
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:26,946
- Got it. I'm sorry, Mrs. Gray
- Oh, don't be.

91
00:11:34,518 --> 00:11:36,848
Why would Jack do that?
It's insane.

92
00:11:39,585 --> 00:11:40,694
What?

93
00:11:40,729 --> 00:11:42,020
I got a report from the FAA,

94
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,940
they don't think that the
helicopter crash was an accident.

95
00:11:45,453 --> 00:11:47,456
They said it looks like sabotage.

96
00:11:47,491 --> 00:11:49,660
Sabotage? Why wouldn't
you tell me that?

97
00:11:49,677 --> 00:11:50,758
I didn't want you to worry.

98
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:52,443
You think Jack did that too?

99
00:11:52,543 --> 00:11:53,969
Why would he be
going with these links?

100
00:11:54,453 --> 00:11:55,898
I don't know.

101
00:11:58,667 --> 00:11:59,857
But don't worry.

102
00:12:00,057 --> 00:12:02,808
I swear to keep you safe,
and I will.

103
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,373
Ana, it's not funny.

104
00:12:10,494 --> 00:12:12,957
- Hey.
- Oh, uh.

105
00:12:13,131 --> 00:12:15,718
Mr. and Mrs. Gray, welcome home.

106
00:12:15,753 --> 00:12:18,081
- Hi, Gail.
- Sawyer, Ma'am.

107
00:12:18,116 --> 00:12:20,292
- Hello, hi.
- This is my colleague, Prescott.

108
00:12:20,327 --> 00:12:22,571
Just Sawyer and Prescott.
That's it?

109
00:12:22,771 --> 00:12:23,919
Keep it simple.

110
00:12:23,954 --> 00:12:26,066
They will be in charge of
your personal security.

111
00:12:26,637 --> 00:12:29,361
Oh, both of you?

112
00:12:29,561 --> 00:12:31,328
We'll mostly take turns, Mrs Grey.

113
00:12:31,363 --> 00:12:33,020
You will not even know we are here.

114
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,356
That seems unlikely,

115
00:12:34,391 --> 00:12:36,306
but thank you.

116
00:12:37,071 --> 00:12:39,414
Can I get you something to eat
before I unpack your bags?

117
00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:41,868
I'm good.
Anastasia?

118
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:45,614
- Some tea perhaps?
- Yeah, yes. Thank you.

119
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:48,430
I mean, please.
And thank you.

120
00:12:49,453 --> 00:12:51,652
- I'll be in my office
- Okay.

121
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,971
Later, baby.

122
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,530
Now when you have a moment,

123
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,552
we should discuss how you'd
like to run the household.

124
00:12:59,795 --> 00:13:01,418
Run the household?

125
00:13:01,693 --> 00:13:03,126
The dinner menus,

126
00:13:03,326 --> 00:13:05,769
the wine list,
the flowers...

127
00:13:05,804 --> 00:13:09,187
...and what changes you'd like
made to the decor?

128
00:13:10,995 --> 00:13:13,957
I know it's a
lot to take in.

129
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:16,810
- Mrs. Grey, there is no rush.
- Can't you just call me Anna?

130
00:13:16,926 --> 00:13:20,444
Well, Mr. Gray likes to
be called Mr. Grey.

131
00:13:20,698 --> 00:13:22,668
So, that would be a little odd.

132
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,189
Okay.

133
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:25,998
Now what would
you like for tonight?

134
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:27,266
I have beef...

135
00:13:27,466 --> 00:13:29,282
Actually I was kind of
thinking that maybe I

136
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:32,982
could just cook dinner
for Christian tonight.

137
00:13:33,127 --> 00:13:33,712
Mrs. Grey.

138
00:13:33,932 --> 00:13:35,415
I'm so sorry. You prob...

139
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,574
I don't wanna
mess up your plans.

140
00:13:37,796 --> 00:13:41,256
Mrs. Gray,
this is your home.

141
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,873
This is your kitchen.

142
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:45,231
You don't need to ask permission.

143
00:13:45,451 --> 00:13:47,213
Now, why don't I show
you what's in the freeze

144
00:13:47,413 --> 00:13:48,713
and you can take it from there.

145
00:13:48,945 --> 00:13:51,091
Perfect.

146
00:13:54,429 --> 00:13:55,508
Perfect timing.

147
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,146
- Where's Gail?
- I gave her a night off.

148
00:14:00,287 --> 00:14:01,288
Sit.

149
00:14:05,318 --> 00:14:08,693
Medium-Rare.
Just how sir likes it.

150
00:14:09,404 --> 00:14:10,762
I can get used to this.

151
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:14,651
Well, we 're kind of married,
so you might have to.

152
00:14:14,893 --> 00:14:16,501
I meant you, in my kitchen.

153
00:14:18,778 --> 00:14:21,619
You mean, barefoot and pregnant?

154
00:14:24,379 --> 00:14:26,851
- That was a joke.
- Yeah.

155
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:30,293
I'm assuming it wasn't the

156
00:14:30,493 --> 00:14:33,137
barefoot part that made you
nearly choke on your food.

157
00:14:36,428 --> 00:14:38,716
You do wanna have
kids some day, right?

158
00:14:39,321 --> 00:14:41,451
Someday, sure.

159
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,391
You don't really sound sure.

160
00:14:46,603 --> 00:14:48,397
You know what I'm sure about?

161
00:14:49,545 --> 00:14:52,070
- That's great stake.
- Christian.

162
00:14:57,217 --> 00:15:00,441
- Do you not wanna have kids?
- Of course.

163
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,411
One day, just,
not now.

164
00:15:04,514 --> 00:15:06,377
I'm not ready to share you

165
00:15:06,577 --> 00:15:07,907
with anyone.

166
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,965
- Mrs. Grey.
- Thank you.

167
00:15:46,964 --> 00:15:49,854
Anna, nice of you to join us.

168
00:15:49,986 --> 00:15:53,816
Hi Liz, am I in the right office?

169
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:54,922
We had a makeover,

170
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:57,916
Mr Roach wanted to welcome
the new fiction editor.

171
00:15:58,006 --> 00:16:01,100
- Who's the new fiction editor?
- You are.

172
00:16:01,385 --> 00:16:04,446
You got a promotion.

173
00:16:04,481 --> 00:16:08,292
- I got a promotion?
- And you were not even here.

174
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:13,045
- Anna!
- Hi, Hannah.

175
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,768
- Hi.
- Welcome back.

176
00:16:15,803 --> 00:16:17,918
- How do you like your new desk?
- Amazing.

177
00:16:17,953 --> 00:16:19,704
I'm gonna let your get settled in.

178
00:16:19,739 --> 00:16:22,236
And Anna, good luck.
Not that you need it.

179
00:16:23,898 --> 00:16:27,911
So... Who is that beautiful man?

180
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:30,702
Oh, that's Sawyer.
My personal security.

181
00:16:32,152 --> 00:16:35,051
I know... It's very very fancy.

182
00:16:35,277 --> 00:16:39,530
- Can we find a spot for him?
- I might have an opening.

183
00:16:39,906 --> 00:16:43,403
Hannah?
Down girl.

184
00:16:43,438 --> 00:16:45,504
Everything is in
relativelythe same spot.

185
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:47,741
Oh, and I asked IT
to change your email.

186
00:16:48,524 --> 00:16:51,867
Because they still have you as
Anna Steele instead of Anna Grey.

187
00:16:54,321 --> 00:16:57,524
Oh, um... Let's just leave it for a while.

188
00:16:57,724 --> 00:16:59,799
Done. And Boyce Fox is in town.

189
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:04,911
Awesome, thank you,
thanks Hannah.

190
00:17:22,686 --> 00:17:26,001
This is amazing. Anna, I
can't thank you enough.

191
00:17:26,229 --> 00:17:28,443
Well, you did the work.

192
00:17:28,696 --> 00:17:30,936
Now, when am I gonna see
pages for book too?

193
00:17:31,226 --> 00:17:35,470
Already? Well, I have
written 3 chapters so far.

194
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:39,670
Christian, Boyce.
This is my husband, Christian Gray.

195
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,555
- Christian, this is Boyce Fox
- Pleasure to meet you.

196
00:17:42,735 --> 00:17:44,749
Absolutely. Do you mind?

197
00:17:44,949 --> 00:17:46,329
I need a word with Mrs Steele here.

198
00:17:46,364 --> 00:17:49,001
No. Actually no,
we are not finished.

199
00:17:50,162 --> 00:17:52,246
You know, I'm just gonna grab a coffee.

200
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:53,623
It's nice to meet you.

201
00:17:58,632 --> 00:18:01,673
- Good looking guy.
- Seriously, Christian?

202
00:18:02,262 --> 00:18:04,570
You evading my authors now?

203
00:18:06,802 --> 00:18:10,097
I tried emailing you, it bounced.

204
00:18:10,302 --> 00:18:12,977
There is no Anastasia Grey at SIP.

205
00:18:14,368 --> 00:18:18,188
I know, Anna Steele is
the name I use at work.

206
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:20,695
And I know you're gonna
say I don't need to work.

207
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:25,072
But I can's stay home and do
lunches and choose wall paper.

208
00:18:25,073 --> 00:18:26,512
I'll loose my mind.

209
00:18:26,725 --> 00:18:29,591
I work because I love my job.

210
00:18:29,837 --> 00:18:33,388
Understood, but you can't
love it as Anna Grey?

211
00:18:33,671 --> 00:18:36,441
I need to have my
own identity here.

212
00:18:36,733 --> 00:18:39,656
People already think I got to
where I am because of you.

213
00:18:39,857 --> 00:18:40,877
But you didn't.

214
00:18:40,977 --> 00:18:43,579
You got this through
hard work and talent.

215
00:18:45,216 --> 00:18:46,950
Why does it matter
what you call yourself?

216
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,595
Who gives a shit
what people think?

217
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,241
Apparently you do.

218
00:18:51,322 --> 00:18:54,129
Would you change your name for me?

219
00:18:55,013 --> 00:18:57,635
Yes, if it meant that much to you.

220
00:18:58,862 --> 00:19:02,283
Okay, I'll think about it.

221
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:05,124
- You will?
- Yeah.

222
00:19:06,703 --> 00:19:10,293
That's how this works.
Remember?

223
00:19:10,328 --> 00:19:14,147
Talk, listen,
work stuff out.

224
00:19:14,805 --> 00:19:18,147
Now, get lost.
I gotta find my author.

225
00:19:18,182 --> 00:19:20,280
And you need to shave.

226
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:26,270
I'll pick you up at five.

227
00:19:27,223 --> 00:19:29,226
I might not be done by then.

228
00:19:29,874 --> 00:19:33,709
My boss's boss's boss is
kind of a pain in the ass.

229
00:19:37,975 --> 00:19:38,993
Boyce.

230
00:19:50,751 --> 00:19:53,896
Sawyer comes right with Taylor.
You're coming with me.

231
00:19:58,186 --> 00:20:01,510
- Can I drive?
- This? I do not think so.

232
00:20:01,545 --> 00:20:02,582
- Let me drive it.
- No.

233
00:20:02,782 --> 00:20:03,871
- Let me drive it.
- No.

234
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:57,688
I feel like I have been here before.

235
00:20:57,889 --> 00:20:58,946
You saw it.

236
00:20:58,981 --> 00:21:01,910
When we were sailing on the south.

237
00:21:02,413 --> 00:21:05,317
- It's beautiful.
- I bought it.

238
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,897
For us, there is a home.

239
00:21:10,905 --> 00:21:12,513
I should have asked you first.

240
00:21:13,228 --> 00:21:15,566
If you don't like it
we can always.

241
00:21:17,855 --> 00:21:20,097
- I love it
- You do?

242
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,166
Oh, my God!

243
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:32,414
- Christian
- Hi.

244
00:21:33,683 --> 00:21:35,379
- Anastasia.
- Hi.

245
00:21:35,579 --> 00:21:37,568
This is Jaya Matteo, the architect.

246
00:21:37,928 --> 00:21:41,800
- She is a friend of Elliott.
- This location is perfect.

247
00:21:42,087 --> 00:21:44,647
I'm gonna build you
a fabulous house.

248
00:21:45,161 --> 00:21:48,155
- I'd like to show Anna inside.
- Of course.

249
00:21:48,447 --> 00:21:51,642
That JQ profile on you.

250
00:21:52,139 --> 00:21:55,709
- I love what you're doing in Africa.
- Oh, thank you.

251
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,803
Now,

252
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:00,324
let me show you
what I have in mind.

253
00:22:02,344 --> 00:22:06,575
A state of the art, self
sufficient, smart house.

254
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:09,190
Marine steel self cleaning glass.

255
00:22:09,225 --> 00:22:12,723
A guest wing with an entertaining
area to the west.

256
00:22:13,597 --> 00:22:18,428
And this, infinity pool, will
really make that beautiful sound.

257
00:22:19,883 --> 00:22:23,851
Um... You wanna tear the
whole house down?

258
00:22:23,886 --> 00:22:26,709
Don't you?
It's so dated.

259
00:22:26,744 --> 00:22:29,876
I like it.
I think it has character.

260
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:36,339
Well, a new house
would be a statement

261
00:22:36,374 --> 00:22:40,763
and Ecologically efficient. I mean
this older places are so impractical.

262
00:22:41,952 --> 00:22:45,293
- But it's up to you.
- Actually it's up to my wife.

263
00:22:45,922 --> 00:22:48,045
What she says goes.

264
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,319
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

265
00:22:51,386 --> 00:22:52,421
Hey, Ross.
Yeah.

266
00:22:53,811 --> 00:22:57,920
Huh, I suppose we could reuse
some of the existing stone.

267
00:22:59,387 --> 00:23:01,492
It is Jaya, right?

268
00:23:03,462 --> 00:23:05,777
I'm sure you are very
good at what you do.

269
00:23:05,879 --> 00:23:08,116
Otherwise, Christian wouldn't
have asked for your input.

270
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:13,401
But please stop speaking of
my husband as if I weren't here.

271
00:23:13,436 --> 00:23:14,636
Anna.

272
00:23:16,139 --> 00:23:18,931
I have designed many
prestige projects.

273
00:23:18,966 --> 00:23:20,853
You may call me Mrs. Grey.

274
00:23:21,552 --> 00:23:24,895
And this is not a Prestige project,
this is gonna be our home.

275
00:23:25,185 --> 00:23:28,774
So, if you want this job,

276
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:30,986
I suggest you stop making
eyes off my husband

277
00:23:31,186 --> 00:23:32,819
and keep your hands to yourself.

278
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:36,493
Or you can go and
climb back into your

279
00:23:36,693 --> 00:23:39,038
shit color car and
drive back to Seattle.

280
00:23:39,073 --> 00:23:40,886
It's up to you.

281
00:23:42,699 --> 00:23:47,148
Look, I'm sorry Mrs. Grey
but I would never...

282
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,476
It won't happen again.

283
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,757
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

284
00:23:55,792 --> 00:23:58,304
We were just discussing
an alternative approach.

285
00:23:58,615 --> 00:24:02,146
Something less in your face,

286
00:24:02,658 --> 00:24:05,054
more respectful.

287
00:24:07,027 --> 00:24:10,754
Sure, only start over.

288
00:24:13,915 --> 00:24:15,479
I'll draw up new plans

289
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,737
and you'll have them in
the next few weeks.

290
00:24:18,772 --> 00:24:20,590
Great, we look forward to it.

291
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:23,174
- Mr Grey.
- Thanks, Jaya.

292
00:24:23,656 --> 00:24:25,633
Mrs. Grey.

293
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:32,523
This is gonna be fun.

294
00:24:33,042 --> 00:24:37,304
I am paying for extra security and
you are scarier than any of them.

295
00:24:37,504 --> 00:24:38,982
Here.

296
00:24:39,427 --> 00:24:42,308
You can handle her,
you can handle this.

297
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:00,586
Wow, Anna.
Easy, Anna.

298
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,192
We've lost Taylor and Sawyer.

299
00:25:18,227 --> 00:25:21,917
Slackers.
I am a race car driver.

300
00:25:22,548 --> 00:25:26,635
Hey, Taylor.
The SUV.

301
00:25:27,395 --> 00:25:28,746
I see it.

302
00:25:31,521 --> 00:25:33,198
We are being followed.

303
00:25:33,233 --> 00:25:36,041
- That's Dodge?
- Sawyer ran the plates, it's fake.

304
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,860
- Loose them.
- Seriously?

305
00:25:37,895 --> 00:25:39,698
Seriously.

306
00:25:40,065 --> 00:25:41,348
Loose them.

307
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:02,186
You can make it, don't slow down.
Heads up and get us home.

308
00:26:10,768 --> 00:26:12,591
Good work.

309
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,634
Taylor, I've got you on speaker.

310
00:26:32,834 --> 00:26:34,483
<i>We are right behind the Dodge.
Mr. Grey,</i>

311
00:26:34,683 --> 00:26:36,292
<i>he's still trying to
catch up with you.</i>

312
00:26:36,327 --> 00:26:37,726
Can you make out the driver?

313
00:26:37,761 --> 00:26:39,532
<i>No, not yet.</i>

314
00:26:41,752 --> 00:26:43,402
Go.

315
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,583
Come on, dude.

316
00:26:57,301 --> 00:26:59,271
- Flash rear lights.
- That's a dick move.

317
00:27:07,408 --> 00:27:08,728
Get out here.

318
00:27:21,968 --> 00:27:23,552
There, the parking lot.

319
00:27:31,008 --> 00:27:32,028
- Taylor?
- Yes sir.

320
00:27:32,228 --> 00:27:34,666
- Have we lost him?
- We're still in pursuit.

321
00:27:35,368 --> 00:27:37,215
You okay?

322
00:27:44,616 --> 00:27:47,227
- We are in a parking lot.
- I know.

323
00:28:20,184 --> 00:28:22,563
Sorry, Mr. Grey, we lost them.

324
00:28:22,853 --> 00:28:24,274
That's gotta be Hyde.

325
00:28:24,543 --> 00:28:26,612
I got this from Highway Patrol.

326
00:28:28,194 --> 00:28:31,090
That's not Hyde.
That looks like a woman.

327
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,247
Where's Leyla Williams right now?

328
00:28:33,282 --> 00:28:34,706
Still with the family in Connecticut.

329
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:36,870
Whoever it is
she's gotta be working with Hyde.

330
00:28:37,098 --> 00:28:39,432
- What's the latest on him?
- He hasn't been seen for month.

331
00:28:39,456 --> 00:28:41,654
No purchases,
no ATM transactions.

332
00:28:41,689 --> 00:28:43,434
What about friends, family?

333
00:28:43,469 --> 00:28:44,754
Yeah, not much of either.

334
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:47,634
OK. I want everything there
is to know about Hyde.

335
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:50,576
Where he comes from,
his shoe size. All of it.

336
00:28:50,611 --> 00:28:52,702
And I want the three of
you with us in New York.

337
00:28:52,737 --> 00:28:53,793
What?

338
00:28:53,893 --> 00:28:55,726
I have to go there for a meeting
this week. You're coming with me.

339
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:01,795
Can you guys give us a second?

340
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:07,278
You know I can't go to New York,
I have to work.

341
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:09,872
- Take it with you
- I have meetings.

342
00:29:09,907 --> 00:29:11,672
- Reschedule.
- I have to show up.

343
00:29:11,707 --> 00:29:14,827
I have responsibilities, you
can't keep me in a cage.

344
00:29:14,862 --> 00:29:16,723
- I just want you to be safe.
- I will be safe.

345
00:29:16,758 --> 00:29:18,542
I have Sawyer and Prescott.

346
00:29:19,985 --> 00:29:21,682
I'll be fine.

347
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:24,363
You need a haircut.

348
00:29:25,237 --> 00:29:26,466
Not the priority

349
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:28,744
- I can do it.
- No.

350
00:29:28,945 --> 00:29:31,429
Yeah, I used to cut my
dad's hair all the time.

351
00:29:31,464 --> 00:29:33,207
I don't want to
look like your father.

352
00:29:34,781 --> 00:29:36,109
Okay.

353
00:30:12,142 --> 00:30:14,130
- Christian.
- What?

354
00:30:14,131 --> 00:30:16,366
- You're distracting me.
- Okay.

355
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:18,597
You 're done?

356
00:30:30,923 --> 00:30:33,830
Okay, enough.
Enough!

357
00:30:34,613 --> 00:30:38,470
- Where are the scissors?
- On my desk.

358
00:30:38,535 --> 00:30:41,098
Wait here.
Don't move.

359
00:30:41,788 --> 00:30:44,251
I am not going anywhere

360
00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:29,074
Why is there a
gun in your desk?

361
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:30,392
It's Leila's.

362
00:31:31,697 --> 00:31:33,942
Why didn't you give it to the cops?

363
00:31:35,753 --> 00:31:38,341
She's in enough trouble.

364
00:31:41,377 --> 00:31:42,434
Here.

365
00:31:49,516 --> 00:31:51,777
Like a river.

366
00:31:52,478 --> 00:31:53,543
Okay.

367
00:32:17,683 --> 00:32:21,819
- Good morning, wife
- Good morning, husband.

368
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:24,611
I am off.

369
00:32:27,733 --> 00:32:31,161
Fly safe.
Text me when you land.

370
00:32:31,196 --> 00:32:33,365
Stay close to
Sawyer and Prescott

371
00:32:33,733 --> 00:32:36,247
Come straight home after work.

372
00:32:36,757 --> 00:32:38,825
I really promise.

373
00:32:39,151 --> 00:32:40,760
I love you.

374
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,054
Hi, Mr. Roach.

375
00:33:06,254 --> 00:33:09,456
Jerry, come on,
Jesus it's Jerry, OK?

376
00:33:11,378 --> 00:33:14,799
Pre-orders for Boyce Fox,
check that out. Check it out.

377
00:33:16,643 --> 00:33:18,307
Two hundred thousand?

378
00:33:18,386 --> 00:33:19,928
That includes the
books and the marketing

379
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,519
hasn't yet gotten
off the blocks yet.

380
00:33:21,543 --> 00:33:22,725
Oh, my God.

381
00:33:22,926 --> 00:33:25,196
You were right
about his readerships.

382
00:33:25,396 --> 00:33:27,520
That's really just.

383
00:33:27,781 --> 00:33:30,301
That's good work, really
good work Anna.

384
00:33:31,396 --> 00:33:32,646
Keep it coming.

385
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,711
<i>Kate- Hey stranger! Drinks tonight?
I got us a table at the Bunker club!</i>

386
00:34:08,436 --> 00:34:10,449
Sawyer, can we go to the
bunker club please?

387
00:34:10,484 --> 00:34:12,280
Mr. Gray said to take
you straight home.

388
00:34:12,447 --> 00:34:15,758
Oh! Mr. Grey is not here, I am.

389
00:34:15,793 --> 00:34:17,742
So... Bunker club please.

390
00:34:18,287 --> 00:34:20,358
Yes Ma'am.

391
00:34:22,509 --> 00:34:24,447
So really? A personal bodyguard?

392
00:34:24,647 --> 00:34:26,826
Because Elliott wasn't exaggerating.

393
00:34:27,122 --> 00:34:27,920
What do you mean?

394
00:34:27,955 --> 00:34:29,523
He said that Christian
ran security for the

395
00:34:29,724 --> 00:34:31,293
whole family after what
happened with Hyde.

396
00:34:31,317 --> 00:34:33,014
Apparently it's driving
them nuts and

397
00:34:33,214 --> 00:34:34,865
Mia keeps giving
hard time to sleep.

398
00:34:35,522 --> 00:34:36,538
Why do you look me like

399
00:34:36,838 --> 00:34:38,044
you don't know what
I am talking about?

400
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:41,084
I don't know what
you're talking about.

401
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,289
After they found all those
files on Hyde's computer,

402
00:34:43,603 --> 00:34:47,290
stuff about Christian, the Greys
he didn't tell you any of that?

403
00:34:47,614 --> 00:34:52,320
No, no, he didn't. But I'm
sure, he had his reasons.

404
00:34:53,876 --> 00:34:57,535
Hey, hi, excuse me, can we get
two more Martinis, please?

405
00:34:57,735 --> 00:34:58,838
<i>Of course, right away.</i>

406
00:34:59,524 --> 00:35:02,966
I can't really. I promised
Christian, I would go home.

407
00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:06,609
Oh come on, you're afraid that your
hot bodyguard's gonna knock on you.

408
00:35:06,849 --> 00:35:10,436
Yeah, probably.

409
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:14,764
- How is Elliott? What's going on?
- He is busy.

410
00:35:15,117 --> 00:35:19,094
He is working on this Eco project
with that architect Jaya Matteo.

411
00:35:19,378 --> 00:35:22,761
- One with the the really big...
- Plans.

412
00:35:23,123 --> 00:35:26,567
Yeah, Hugh plans, and boy, does
Elliott like to look at those plans.

413
00:35:26,602 --> 00:35:30,538
- No, he adores you Kate.
- I don't know, I just...

414
00:35:30,573 --> 00:35:32,516
I have this feeling.

415
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,713
Why don't you just
ask him straight out?

416
00:35:34,748 --> 00:35:37,048
Honestly I don't know
if I know the answer.

417
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:41,416
What ever. I hate that
I even care this much.

418
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:43,802
- No, no!
- There you go.

419
00:35:44,002 --> 00:35:46,175
Thank you, just keep
'em coming. Will you?

420
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:48,026
- And don't ever stop. Thank you.
- Of course.

421
00:35:48,324 --> 00:35:51,725
No, I really can't, I am gonna
get in so much trouble.

422
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:54,682
Look at you,
you're so...

423
00:35:54,717 --> 00:35:56,525
- What?
- Married.

424
00:35:57,796 --> 00:35:59,003
I know.

425
00:35:59,596 --> 00:36:01,786
Honestly, it happened so fast.

426
00:36:02,947 --> 00:36:04,790
Make my head spin.

427
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:09,242
- It suits you.
- Yeah, I think it does.

428
00:36:09,342 --> 00:36:12,031
Yeah, except you don't
see enough your friends.

429
00:36:12,284 --> 00:36:15,561
- I know, I know, I'm sorry.
- I missed your face. Cheers.

430
00:36:15,596 --> 00:36:17,386
Cheers.

431
00:36:17,421 --> 00:36:19,404
- To your face.
- To my plans.

432
00:36:20,815 --> 00:36:23,774
Oh, my God, what is that?

433
00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:27,887
You know me,
I hate jelly fish.

434
00:36:27,922 --> 00:36:30,839
And I'm like halfway out of the
water and halfway off the terrain.

435
00:36:31,533 --> 00:36:33,690
Oh, my God.
You are so cute.

436
00:36:33,975 --> 00:36:35,868
- I missed you.
- I missed you.

437
00:36:36,165 --> 00:36:38,333
I'm gonna stalk you until
you make another date OK?

438
00:36:39,896 --> 00:36:41,496
Oh sorry, my phone.
It's just crazy.

439
00:36:41,531 --> 00:36:43,011
- It's OK
- Oh Jesus.

440
00:36:44,191 --> 00:36:47,354
- Come on, we'll give you a ride.
- Okay.

441
00:36:47,942 --> 00:36:51,024
<i>This is Christian Gray.
Leave a message.</i>

442
00:36:54,742 --> 00:36:55,773
Sawyer,

443
00:36:55,808 --> 00:37:00,291
if you speak to my
husband tonight,

444
00:37:00,326 --> 00:37:04,088
just don't say anything.
Let me tell him

445
00:37:04,123 --> 00:37:06,011
that I was out with Kate. OK?

446
00:37:06,735 --> 00:37:08,280
Mr. Gray already knows.

447
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,100
I spoke with him
when you got off work.

448
00:37:14,695 --> 00:37:16,135
Shit.

449
00:37:45,567 --> 00:37:46,682
Mrs Gray?

450
00:37:48,395 --> 00:37:50,554
Anna, you are
gonna be a good girl.

451
00:37:51,544 --> 00:37:53,747
And you will walk to the elevator

452
00:37:54,101 --> 00:37:57,526
nice and slow.

453
00:37:59,355 --> 00:38:01,396
Mrs. Gray!
Let her go.

454
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:09,608
- Go ahead. Take the shot.
- Drop the knife.

455
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,196
Hands on your head.

456
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,601
Hands on your head or I will fire.

457
00:38:19,754 --> 00:38:21,005
You okay, Mrs. Gray?

458
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,361
- Did he hurt you?
- No. I am fine.

459
00:38:23,508 --> 00:38:25,499
- Better restrain him.
- I don't have anything.

460
00:38:25,534 --> 00:38:29,759
We do, I can find something.

461
00:38:31,927 --> 00:38:36,209
- So, Hyde's a former colleague of yours?
- Ah, yes. He was my boss.

462
00:38:36,426 --> 00:38:37,703
Until a few weeks ago but,

463
00:38:37,738 --> 00:38:40,497
they let him go.

464
00:38:40,532 --> 00:38:42,985
- Can I ask why?
- Because he attacked me.

465
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,864
Sir, we recovered this from an elevator

466
00:38:46,064 --> 00:38:47,922
maintenance vehicle
parked in lower garage.

467
00:38:48,648 --> 00:38:49,677
Stolen plates,

468
00:38:49,712 --> 00:38:51,736
must have been how the
suspect gained access.

469
00:38:53,591 --> 00:38:55,418
This mean anything
to you, Mrs. Gray?

470
00:38:59,847 --> 00:39:01,606
No, nothing.

471
00:39:01,846 --> 00:39:05,105
Mr. Grey is on his way home,
we will need to wrap this up.

472
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:08,444
We will finish this another time
Mrs. Gray. You rest.

473
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:11,300
And uh...

474
00:39:11,335 --> 00:39:13,375
Don't worry about Hyde, we've
got enough to hold him.

475
00:39:13,399 --> 00:39:14,745
He won't be going heavy.

476
00:39:15,821 --> 00:39:17,352
Alright.

477
00:39:33,586 --> 00:39:34,787
Hi.

478
00:39:45,867 --> 00:39:47,411
Come to bed.

479
00:39:59,602 --> 00:40:01,025
Maybe later.

480
00:40:50,429 --> 00:40:51,821
I can't.

481
00:41:06,186 --> 00:41:07,409
Anna, hey.

482
00:41:08,909 --> 00:41:11,128
I just saw this.
Are you okay?

483
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:18,108
Must have been terrifying.
Are you sure you should be in work?

484
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:20,008
Yes, it was but I'm, I'm...

485
00:41:20,164 --> 00:41:21,413
I'm fine.

486
00:41:22,266 --> 00:41:23,587
I'm fine.

487
00:41:30,915 --> 00:41:33,626
One of the reports said
that it was Jack Hyde.

488
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,700
It was.

489
00:41:37,714 --> 00:41:39,082
What did he want?

490
00:41:39,308 --> 00:41:43,235
Liz, I appreciate your concern
but I don't wanna talk about it.

491
00:41:45,524 --> 00:41:46,906
Okay.

492
00:41:47,133 --> 00:41:49,498
I don't know what
I'm gonna tell Mr. Roach.

493
00:41:50,826 --> 00:41:52,802
I will talk to Jerry.

494
00:41:54,207 --> 00:41:57,889
Whatever you say,
Mrs. Gray.

495
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:09,821
Hello?

496
00:42:16,796 --> 00:42:18,674
Welcome home Anastasia.

497
00:42:20,542 --> 00:42:21,680
Christian?

498
00:42:22,483 --> 00:42:23,797
Where's everybody?

499
00:42:23,993 --> 00:42:25,162
Elsewhere.

500
00:42:31,523 --> 00:42:33,458
I thought you were mad at me.

501
00:42:33,999 --> 00:42:35,773
Turn around.

502
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,548
We're going to the playroom.

503
00:43:45,259 --> 00:43:47,404
I'm gonna drive you wild.

504
00:44:21,664 --> 00:44:23,915
That's how you make me feel.

505
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:27,043
Christian.

506
00:44:28,197 --> 00:44:30,053
You promise one thing

507
00:44:30,829 --> 00:44:32,610
then do the opposite.

508
00:44:37,339 --> 00:44:39,223
Now you know how that feels.

509
00:44:39,897 --> 00:44:42,178
Christian... What are you doing?

510
00:44:42,213 --> 00:44:44,642
- Don't stop.
- Frustrating, right?

511
00:44:44,677 --> 00:44:45,982
Why are you stopping?

512
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:48,110
Frustrating like you.

513
00:44:48,145 --> 00:44:49,832
Red, red.

514
00:44:49,867 --> 00:44:52,668
Red, red, red, red!

515
00:45:14,761 --> 00:45:18,052
That was not love.
Christian, that was revenge.

516
00:45:18,087 --> 00:45:19,706
You told me you were coming
straight home

517
00:45:19,741 --> 00:45:21,844
Don't use the red room
to even the score.

518
00:45:21,879 --> 00:45:22,894
I was scared for you.

519
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:25,551
I was safer in that bar
with Kate than I was here.

520
00:45:26,439 --> 00:45:28,204
I denied you,

521
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:29,911
so you would understand
what it feels like

522
00:45:30,011 --> 00:45:32,312
for me when you
break your promises.

523
00:45:32,347 --> 00:45:33,685
You denied me to punish me.

524
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,295
I felt powerless knowing
that Hyde was out there.

525
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:38,383
I was angry,
I was away from home.

526
00:45:41,161 --> 00:45:43,954
I just wanted to see my friends.

527
00:45:43,989 --> 00:45:45,905
But Christian, why didn't
you tell me that

528
00:45:46,105 --> 00:45:48,112
he was keeping files
on you and your family?

529
00:45:48,498 --> 00:45:50,600
What is that about?

530
00:45:50,635 --> 00:45:52,057
Anna, please.

531
00:45:58,578 --> 00:46:01,140
The truth is I have no idea.

532
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,784
Why is he going to these
links to get to us?

533
00:46:03,871 --> 00:46:05,643
There has to be a reason.

534
00:46:06,558 --> 00:46:08,113
There is gotta be some connection.

535
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:09,365
I know.

536
00:46:17,899 --> 00:46:20,214
You know, I had a dream last night.

537
00:46:21,435 --> 00:46:24,382
That you are dead.

538
00:46:24,417 --> 00:46:26,647
And you are lying on the concrete.

539
00:46:27,712 --> 00:46:31,414
And you were cold and
I couldn't wake you.

540
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:35,255
I'm fine.

541
00:46:36,871 --> 00:46:38,745
I'm right here, I'm fine.

542
00:46:41,936 --> 00:46:44,068
Hyde is locked up now.

543
00:46:44,311 --> 00:46:47,586
And I'm right here with you.

544
00:46:50,545 --> 00:46:51,964
I'm sorry.

545
00:46:58,397 --> 00:47:00,952
- Sawyer.
- Hanna.

546
00:47:05,869 --> 00:47:08,003
Anna Stee... Gray.

547
00:47:08,345 --> 00:47:12,628
Mrs. Gray, it's your boss's boss's boss.
Look out your window.

548
00:47:13,088 --> 00:47:16,233
I think you deserved
a break from all this.

549
00:47:16,268 --> 00:47:18,429
I'm taking you away for the weekend.

550
00:47:18,464 --> 00:47:21,869
Mrs. Jones has packed your bags.
It's in the trunk.

551
00:47:21,904 --> 00:47:25,977
Did she know? Do I get to know
where we are going this time?

552
00:47:26,012 --> 00:47:27,013
Yes babe.

553
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,399
You won that auction.
Right as where gets

554
00:47:29,499 --> 00:47:31,905
- your money's worth.
- Okay I'm coming.

555
00:47:35,957 --> 00:47:38,913
- Nice to see you again, Statham.
- Mrs. Grey, Mr. Grey.

556
00:47:46,106 --> 00:47:47,488
- Surprise!
- Oh my God!

557
00:47:49,196 --> 00:47:51,598
You don't wanted to see
more of your friends?

558
00:48:20,626 --> 00:48:22,760
That's beautiful.

559
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:27,418
You think this is nice?
You should see it in the snow.

560
00:48:27,453 --> 00:48:29,423
You should totally hit
the sauna together.

561
00:48:29,433 --> 00:48:30,680
Totally.

562
00:48:34,924 --> 00:48:38,303
Okay, this one's yours,
I am at the other end of the house.

563
00:48:38,503 --> 00:48:40,847
And you two can make
as much noise as you can.

564
00:48:43,768 --> 00:48:46,228
And there's a piano.

565
00:49:02,043 --> 00:49:03,321
No way.

566
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:07,404
You guys must have
heard him play before.

567
00:49:07,942 --> 00:49:10,949
- We have never heard him sing
- Ever.

568
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:16,961
Maybe I've heard enough.

569
00:49:39,355 --> 00:49:42,083
Do you think Elliott would
ever cheat on Kate?

570
00:49:45,675 --> 00:49:48,087
She thinks he is sleeping
with Jaya Matteo.

571
00:49:48,321 --> 00:49:51,152
I'm sure he has but
that doesn't mean he has now.

572
00:49:51,187 --> 00:49:52,463
Really? He has?

573
00:49:52,498 --> 00:49:55,969
Probably, Elliott's slept
with half of Seattle.

574
00:49:59,026 --> 00:50:03,806
I didn't know he was so...
Promiscuous.

575
00:50:04,315 --> 00:50:07,205
- Anna, that's none of our business
- I know.

576
00:50:08,022 --> 00:50:12,775
Well, it will be our business when I
murder him for breaking Kate's heart.

577
00:50:17,438 --> 00:50:20,441
Mia said you hardly ever come here.

578
00:50:20,786 --> 00:50:23,711
There's never been someone
I wanted to bring up here.

579
00:50:24,052 --> 00:50:26,162
I was waiting for you.

580
00:50:58,293 --> 00:50:59,522
<i>Anna.</i>

581
00:51:33,035 --> 00:51:34,618
Nice one.

582
00:51:36,467 --> 00:51:37,970
There you are.

583
00:51:38,005 --> 00:51:39,466
I was looking for you.

584
00:51:41,411 --> 00:51:42,412
You alright?

585
00:51:43,063 --> 00:51:44,378
I couldn't sleep.

586
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:46,444
You wanna talk about it?

587
00:51:46,479 --> 00:51:49,785
I've always talked this
pint of icecream about it.

588
00:51:52,953 --> 00:51:54,856
I'll make you some tea.

589
00:52:08,368 --> 00:52:09,940
I'm so sorry.

590
00:52:10,345 --> 00:52:11,764
Not funny.

591
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:14,490
Oh God, it's dripping,
I'll get it.

592
00:52:22,875 --> 00:52:23,974
Okay.

593
00:52:25,045 --> 00:52:26,919
This is mine.

594
00:52:32,063 --> 00:52:33,150
Okay.

595
00:53:58,272 --> 00:54:01,373
- What?
- It's my turn.

596
00:54:30,256 --> 00:54:31,414
- Anna
- What?

597
00:54:31,449 --> 00:54:33,721
Keep it down, no need to
wake up the whole house.

598
00:54:33,756 --> 00:54:36,453
I really don't care
about the whole house.

599
00:55:02,956 --> 00:55:05,491
Christian, Elliott is taking
us hiking, you coming?

600
00:55:05,649 --> 00:55:07,074
No, I have work to do.

601
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:10,345
Come on, it's just
stroll in the hills.

602
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:11,982
When Elliott says stroll he means

603
00:55:12,165 --> 00:55:15,001
twenty miles straight
uphill with but tree bark.

604
00:55:15,458 --> 00:55:17,402
What if I run into a bear?

605
00:55:17,606 --> 00:55:19,544
Good luck to the bear.

606
00:55:22,136 --> 00:55:24,068
How was Christian
like when he was little?

607
00:55:24,328 --> 00:55:25,893
He hasn't ever really talk about it.

608
00:55:25,928 --> 00:55:27,632
That's a miracle he talks at all,

609
00:55:27,667 --> 00:55:29,537
when Mom and Dad
first brought him home,

610
00:55:29,828 --> 00:55:31,076
he never spoke.

611
00:55:31,302 --> 00:55:33,571
He didn't cry, I mean
he's never cried.

612
00:55:33,850 --> 00:55:35,360
He did kick the
crap out of me a few

613
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,113
times when mom
wasn't looking though.

614
00:55:37,148 --> 00:55:38,163
Really?

615
00:55:38,394 --> 00:55:40,728
You guys seem like
you're pretty close now.

616
00:55:41,444 --> 00:55:43,537
Yes, we've grew up
a lot since then.

617
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:45,437
Now I'm just in awe of him.

618
00:55:45,661 --> 00:55:47,565
He's the bravest guy I know.

619
00:55:48,057 --> 00:55:49,776
Nothing scares him

620
00:55:50,436 --> 00:55:52,768
You seem pretty fearless.

621
00:55:53,279 --> 00:55:55,513
Me? Nah.

622
00:55:56,576 --> 00:55:58,103
What are you so afraid of?

623
00:55:59,579 --> 00:56:02,515
Hey Elliott, when's this
forest march gonna end?

624
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:04,601
I promised Anna
we would go shopping.

625
00:56:05,137 --> 00:56:07,360
Well, guess we could go back through town.

626
00:56:07,561 --> 00:56:09,096
I got some errands to run to.

627
00:56:12,065 --> 00:56:14,874
Sir, this just came in.

628
00:56:14,916 --> 00:56:16,505
More background on Hyde

629
00:56:17,031 --> 00:56:20,958
Went to Princeton on scholarship,
graduated.

630
00:56:21,272 --> 00:56:22,521
Smart guy.

631
00:56:22,556 --> 00:56:25,972
Worked for publishers in
New York & Chicago before SIP.

632
00:56:26,702 --> 00:56:27,776
What else?

633
00:56:28,129 --> 00:56:31,471
We tracked down an exorcist
and since Hyde slept with her

634
00:56:31,506 --> 00:56:33,410
made a sex tape,
used it to blackmail her.

635
00:56:33,741 --> 00:56:35,079
Jesus.

636
00:56:35,114 --> 00:56:37,520
- Has she told the police?
- She would go on record.

637
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:39,598
And another thing apparently Hyde was

638
00:56:39,798 --> 00:56:41,676
in and out of foster homes in Detroit.

639
00:56:41,954 --> 00:56:43,518
So was I.

640
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:46,319
- Good work, keep digging.
- Sir.

641
00:56:46,576 --> 00:56:47,747
And Taylor...

642
00:56:47,996 --> 00:56:50,593
Anna is still shaking up.
Not a word about this for now.

643
00:56:50,688 --> 00:56:51,849
Yes sir.

644
00:56:57,724 --> 00:57:00,286
Oh, yes!

645
00:57:00,719 --> 00:57:03,910
I don't know,
it's really low in the back.

646
00:57:03,945 --> 00:57:06,514
- It's hot
- Yeah, but...

647
00:57:06,856 --> 00:57:08,934
Christian is gonna
love this dress.

648
00:57:09,089 --> 00:57:10,914
Help, my zipper's stuck.

649
00:57:12,358 --> 00:57:13,573
Oh, let me see.

650
00:57:34,522 --> 00:57:37,841
- What do you think?
- Oh my God.

651
00:57:37,876 --> 00:57:40,994
Look at you,
you are like a valentine.

652
00:57:41,029 --> 00:57:42,361
Turn around.

653
00:57:42,762 --> 00:57:46,011
- Elliot's gonna love it.
- He's gonna love it.

654
00:57:46,243 --> 00:57:47,796
Shoes.

655
00:57:47,831 --> 00:57:49,262
Let's have a drink.

656
00:57:49,765 --> 00:57:52,362
Oh, girl.
Look at you.

657
00:57:52,397 --> 00:57:54,162
I know
It's kind of like a napkin.

658
00:57:58,881 --> 00:58:01,861
Tell me you didn't
wear that to go hiking.

659
00:58:02,514 --> 00:58:03,834
Of course I did.

660
00:58:04,209 --> 00:58:05,641
I did.
It's um...

661
00:58:07,403 --> 00:58:12,137
It's good for sweating and
has full range of motion.

662
00:58:12,431 --> 00:58:14,315
Very short.

663
00:58:14,667 --> 00:58:15,881
I know.

664
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:19,497
And it's not too far from here.

665
00:58:21,234 --> 00:58:23,233
To here.

666
00:58:24,142 --> 00:58:25,903
To there.

667
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:28,741
To here.

668
00:58:29,428 --> 00:58:31,580
So just don't bend over,

669
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:32,982
we should be fine.

670
00:58:37,303 --> 00:58:38,938
Oops.

671
00:58:46,367 --> 00:58:49,788
Hey Elliott, did I see that
architecture up in town today?

672
00:58:50,064 --> 00:58:53,245
Jaya Matteo. Yeah.

673
00:58:53,511 --> 00:58:56,316
- She has a place here.
- OK.

674
00:58:56,812 --> 00:59:00,159
Are they real, like,
can they be real?

675
00:59:00,405 --> 00:59:01,809
I never asked.

676
00:59:01,844 --> 00:59:04,337
Two bottles of champagne
And six glasses, please.

677
00:59:06,007 --> 00:59:08,228
Are we celebrating something?

678
00:59:19,008 --> 00:59:22,059
At a certain point the idea,

679
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:26,354
of spending the rest of my
life with one person seemed

680
00:59:26,707 --> 00:59:28,538
unimaginable.

681
00:59:29,944 --> 00:59:32,834
And then I met Kate.

682
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:35,585
And I fell head over hills in love.

683
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:42,646
I fell in love with your beauty.

684
00:59:42,890 --> 00:59:45,026
Your grace, your wisdom.

685
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:46,905
For everything that you are.

686
00:59:48,417 --> 00:59:52,432
Now the only thing I can't
imagine is being without you.

687
00:59:52,883 --> 00:59:56,417
Ever, so...

688
00:59:56,701 --> 00:59:58,211
marry me?

689
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:01,275
Please?

690
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:04,488
- Yes, yes, yes, yes!
- God.

691
01:00:11,979 --> 01:00:13,048
Congrats dude!

692
01:00:32,298 --> 01:00:34,774
Now I know why you're acting so weird.

693
01:00:35,303 --> 01:00:38,998
- Did you pick it out yourself?
- A little help from an old friend.

694
01:00:39,574 --> 01:00:41,019
And old girlfriend?

695
01:00:42,698 --> 01:00:46,182
Hey, not everyone marries the
first girl they ever dated.

696
01:00:47,239 --> 01:00:50,908
Some of us like to get a
ride the first time, bro.

697
01:00:54,073 --> 01:00:56,014
Just roll your eyes in me.

698
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:00,154
Maybe.

699
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:02,602
What are you gonna do about it?

700
01:01:15,787 --> 01:01:17,595
Top drawer on your right.

701
01:01:18,579 --> 01:01:20,624
Top drawer on the right. Go.

702
01:01:28,327 --> 01:01:30,649
- No way.
- Anna.

703
01:01:31,008 --> 01:01:32,379
Do as you are told.

704
01:01:40,964 --> 01:01:42,933
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

705
01:01:48,874 --> 01:01:49,967
You alright?

706
01:02:22,958 --> 01:02:25,776
Hey, Dr Green called in,

707
01:02:25,811 --> 01:02:28,571
and there is a Detective
Clark here to see you.

708
01:02:29,876 --> 01:02:30,986
I'm sorry, Mrs. Gray,

709
01:02:31,186 --> 01:02:33,828
but my lieutenant asked me
to check something out.

710
01:02:35,592 --> 01:02:38,085
Jack Hyde claims you and
him were sleeping together

711
01:02:38,185 --> 01:02:39,481
when you worked at SIP.

712
01:02:39,709 --> 01:02:40,673
What?

713
01:02:40,863 --> 01:02:42,774
He tried to break it off,
you got upset.

714
01:02:42,809 --> 01:02:45,623
And you made up this whole sexual
assault story to get him fired.

715
01:02:45,658 --> 01:02:46,652
What?

716
01:02:46,852 --> 01:02:47,857
Says he came to you apartment to

717
01:02:47,892 --> 01:02:49,079
try and straighten things out,

718
01:02:49,279 --> 01:02:51,653
but your security people got
involved and it all went south.

719
01:02:51,688 --> 01:02:53,602
No, that is complete bullshit.

720
01:02:53,637 --> 01:02:56,934
- I'll put that down as a denial.
- Jack attacked me.

721
01:02:56,975 --> 01:02:58,479
Right.

722
01:02:58,679 --> 01:03:00,426
He attacked me and then
he He tried to kidnap me.

723
01:03:00,626 --> 01:03:01,682
Do you believe what he's saying?

724
01:03:01,942 --> 01:03:05,131
Officially, Mrs. Gray, it doesn't
matter what I believe.

725
01:03:06,034 --> 01:03:09,168
Unofficially,
I believe Hyde is a lying piece of shit

726
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:11,298
who say anything to get bail.

727
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:13,873
You need to be ready for that.

728
01:03:14,305 --> 01:03:17,290
- Thank you for your time
- Wait, Jack is applying for bail?

729
01:03:17,566 --> 01:03:20,307
New wing today,
municipal courthouse.

730
01:03:24,039 --> 01:03:27,014
Does your client deny forcing
entry into this penthouse?

731
01:03:27,049 --> 01:03:28,851
He does not, Your Honor.
However...

732
01:03:28,886 --> 01:03:32,157
My client has exhausted all
legitimate means of redress

733
01:03:32,192 --> 01:03:33,578
and merely wanted
to confront the party

734
01:03:33,778 --> 01:03:35,128
responsible for destroying his career.

735
01:03:35,152 --> 01:03:37,763
I think he wanted to do more
than confront them, counselor.

736
01:03:38,217 --> 01:03:41,886
These are not the actions of an
innocent man seeking redress.

737
01:03:42,102 --> 01:03:43,303
However,

738
01:03:43,494 --> 01:03:46,514
given his clean record, the
court will grant bail.

739
01:03:46,785 --> 01:03:49,147
- Set of five hundred thousand dollars.
- Your honor.

740
01:03:49,377 --> 01:03:50,718
Next case.

741
01:03:54,676 --> 01:03:55,885
Okay, let's go.

742
01:04:45,761 --> 01:04:47,838
I did leave a lot of messages.

743
01:04:48,165 --> 01:04:49,896
I know, I have been so busy,

744
01:04:50,096 --> 01:04:52,507
it just kind of slipped
though the cracks.

745
01:04:54,304 --> 01:04:55,745
Before we start...

746
01:05:07,137 --> 01:05:09,673
It seems you are pregnant, Mrs. Gray.

747
01:05:14,629 --> 01:05:16,847
Um...

748
01:05:17,086 --> 01:05:18,401
what?

749
01:05:18,601 --> 01:05:20,472
The shot is almost
a 100% effective.

750
01:05:20,736 --> 01:05:23,188
When administered regularly.

751
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:29,806
There, it's heartbeat.

752
01:05:30,587 --> 01:05:32,103
Where?

753
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:34,972
Just there.

754
01:05:36,885 --> 01:05:38,673
A little blue.

755
01:05:38,824 --> 01:05:41,239
That's it, six seven weeks.

756
01:05:41,274 --> 01:05:42,792
Oh my God!

757
01:05:43,950 --> 01:05:45,554
How did it go today?

758
01:05:45,604 --> 01:05:49,454
Good, I got a visit
from detective Clark.

759
01:05:51,341 --> 01:05:54,658
Apparently Hyde is trying to
say that I came onto him.

760
01:05:55,088 --> 01:05:57,321
He expects people to believe that?

761
01:05:57,573 --> 01:05:59,355
This is his word against mine.

762
01:06:04,414 --> 01:06:06,083
Is that what's bothering you?

763
01:06:07,026 --> 01:06:09,116
Anna, no one will believe him.

764
01:06:09,744 --> 01:06:11,990
And the other assistance,
they'll tell the detectives,

765
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:13,384
I'm pregnant.

766
01:06:16,993 --> 01:06:18,849
Six or seven weeks.

767
01:06:23,691 --> 01:06:25,554
You forgot your shot.

768
01:06:28,029 --> 01:06:29,262
Gosh.

769
01:06:29,775 --> 01:06:31,423
I'm sorry.

770
01:06:31,631 --> 01:06:34,865
- I know it's not good timing.
- I had plans for us.

771
01:06:35,313 --> 01:06:37,549
I wanted to give you the world.

772
01:06:40,608 --> 01:06:43,090
Do you really think that
I'm ready to be a father?

773
01:06:43,125 --> 01:06:44,174
No.

774
01:06:44,908 --> 01:06:47,914
No, I don't,
and I'm not ready to be a mother either

775
01:06:48,114 --> 01:06:49,882
but we'll just figure it out.

776
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:55,103
I'm not ready to figure it out.

777
01:07:22,486 --> 01:07:24,227
He will come back.

778
01:07:47,729 --> 01:07:50,403
<i>Christian, it's me.
Where are you?</i>

779
01:07:51,422 --> 01:07:53,648
<i>Please come home.</i>

780
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:19,609
Hey!

781
01:08:20,053 --> 01:08:22,499
You look mighty fine, Mrs. Gray.

782
01:08:23,998 --> 01:08:28,172
Wow, you look mighty drunk.

783
01:08:28,381 --> 01:08:29,894
Where have you been?

784
01:08:32,885 --> 01:08:35,524
Alright, let's go to bed.

785
01:08:35,828 --> 01:08:38,449
- Now you're talking
- OK, big guy.

786
01:08:38,484 --> 01:08:40,254
Come on, lean on me.

787
01:08:42,202 --> 01:08:44,650
You are so beautiful.

788
01:08:44,685 --> 01:08:47,640
Oh yeah, both of me?

789
01:08:49,147 --> 01:08:51,430
Okay, time for sleep.

790
01:08:51,825 --> 01:08:53,474
This is where it starts.

791
01:08:53,509 --> 01:08:55,115
Where what starts?

792
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,502
Babies mean no sex.

793
01:08:57,910 --> 01:09:01,380
That can't be true,
there would be no siblings.

794
01:09:02,650 --> 01:09:04,932
You are funny

795
01:09:04,967 --> 01:09:07,224
No, come on.

796
01:09:07,259 --> 01:09:09,803
Come on, come on.

797
01:09:13,022 --> 01:09:14,414
Hello.

798
01:09:14,747 --> 01:09:17,160
We have an intruder.

799
01:09:20,332 --> 01:09:22,571
You're gonna take her from me, aren't you?

800
01:09:24,748 --> 01:09:27,970
You'll see.
You'll choose him over me.

801
01:09:29,462 --> 01:09:31,649
Nobody's choosing anybody.

802
01:09:32,569 --> 01:09:38,532
- And he might be a she.
- Oh Jesus.

803
01:09:58,671 --> 01:10:01,233
<i>ELENA - Good to see you tonight.
I'm here for you, anytime.</i>

804
01:11:15,571 --> 01:11:16,673
Anna.

805
01:11:20,418 --> 01:11:21,732
Anastasia.

806
01:11:27,856 --> 01:11:29,103
Anastasia.

807
01:11:43,334 --> 01:11:45,313
Go through the entire apartment
Check every room.

808
01:11:45,348 --> 01:11:47,674
Taylor, check the garage
See if you can talk to the concierge.

809
01:11:47,698 --> 01:11:49,843
Sawyer take a look at the cc TV.

810
01:11:50,456 --> 01:11:53,575
Sawyer,
we're leaving for work in 20 minutes.

811
01:11:53,775 --> 01:11:54,909
Yes, ma'am.

812
01:11:55,065 --> 01:11:56,552
Where the hell were you?

813
01:12:00,095 --> 01:12:01,186
Anna.

814
01:12:09,035 --> 01:12:10,278
Anna.

815
01:12:12,996 --> 01:12:14,896
Anastasia.

816
01:12:16,090 --> 01:12:17,818
Open the door.

817
01:12:18,141 --> 01:12:19,764
Anna.

818
01:12:36,958 --> 01:12:39,194
That's it? You are ignoring me?

819
01:12:39,416 --> 01:12:41,304
Hey.

820
01:12:41,862 --> 01:12:44,199
- Why are you behaving like this?
- I don't know.

821
01:12:44,234 --> 01:12:46,652
May be you should go ask
your friend Mrs. Robinson.

822
01:12:47,190 --> 01:12:48,759
What?

823
01:12:49,662 --> 01:12:51,842
You've been reading my texts?

824
01:12:52,522 --> 01:12:54,357
I have been picking up your shit, Christian

825
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:55,797
I told you, we were just friends.

826
01:12:55,869 --> 01:13:00,515
The time for talking to me was yesterday.
But instead you decided

827
01:13:00,544 --> 01:13:02,402
to go get drunk with
the woman who taught

828
01:13:02,602 --> 01:13:04,326
you how to fuck
when you were a child.

829
01:13:04,834 --> 01:13:09,685
The going gets rough, and
you go running to her.

830
01:13:11,694 --> 01:13:14,874
- I thought you were better than that.
- It wasn't like that.

831
01:13:26,257 --> 01:13:28,197
- You sleep with her?
- No.

832
01:13:28,263 --> 01:13:30,563
- What do you think? I'll cheat on you?
- You did.

833
01:13:30,752 --> 01:13:32,214
You confided in her.

834
01:13:32,428 --> 01:13:36,143
About our private life,
you chose her over me.

835
01:13:37,019 --> 01:13:39,644
And then you came home.

836
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:43,007
And you said, I would
choose this baby over you.

837
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:47,038
You know what?
If I have to, I will.

838
01:13:48,195 --> 01:13:50,644
I will choose this baby
over anybody

839
01:13:50,844 --> 01:13:53,565
because that is what
descent parents do.

840
01:13:54,869 --> 01:13:56,858
It's what your mother
should have done for you

841
01:13:57,059 --> 01:13:59,040
and I am so sorry
that she didn't Christian.

842
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:04,146
I'm sorry. But you are not
a kid anymore, Christian.

843
01:14:04,758 --> 01:14:07,536
You need to grow the fuck up.

844
01:14:19,612 --> 01:14:23,718
You're not happy about this baby.
I got that.

845
01:14:24,052 --> 01:14:27,844
I'm not ecstatic either given
the timing and your reaction.

846
01:14:28,186 --> 01:14:30,485
But babies happen
when you have sex

847
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,847
and you and I tend to do a lot of that.

848
01:14:34,130 --> 01:14:37,312
So we can either do this together,

849
01:14:37,897 --> 01:14:41,243
or I'll do it without you.

850
01:14:41,601 --> 01:14:42,696
And what about us?

851
01:14:42,896 --> 01:14:46,295
Well, when your husband prefers
the company of his ex mistress,

852
01:14:46,330 --> 01:14:48,657
it doesn't really say much
for your marriage. Does it?

853
01:14:48,692 --> 01:14:50,403
Elena and I just talked.

854
01:14:50,645 --> 01:14:53,999
- I was too angry with you.
- I am angry with you Christian,

855
01:14:54,034 --> 01:14:55,363
you left me.

856
01:14:55,398 --> 01:14:58,102
You left me when I needed you.
You fucked up.

857
01:14:58,584 --> 01:14:59,878
I fucked up and I'm sorry.

858
01:15:00,078 --> 01:15:02,118
I am standing here
telling you I'm sorry.

859
01:15:02,296 --> 01:15:03,800
Okay?
She doesn't...

860
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:06,207
She doesn't mean
anything to me.

861
01:15:06,597 --> 01:15:10,319
I don't need her.
I need you.

862
01:15:10,724 --> 01:15:13,761
Would have been good if you
felt that way yesterday.

863
01:15:30,345 --> 01:15:32,047
It turned out so great,
thank you so much.

864
01:15:32,848 --> 01:15:34,688
And if we can just
make the font size

865
01:15:34,888 --> 01:15:36,629
two points bigger
on the hard copy.

866
01:15:41,928 --> 01:15:44,727
Hey, Kate Kavanagh called you three times,

867
01:15:44,728 --> 01:15:45,640
and your husband called,

868
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:48,156
he wanted me to remind you that
he is flying down to Portland

869
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:50,682
- but he'll be back this afternoon.
- Is that all he said?

870
01:15:50,898 --> 01:15:52,097
Yeah.

871
01:15:52,686 --> 01:15:54,513
You okay?
Can I get you a latte?

872
01:15:54,743 --> 01:15:57,337
- No thank you.
- Anna Grey's office.

873
01:15:57,372 --> 01:15:59,599
Miss Kavanagh.

874
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:02,969
Yes, she is, give me one
moment, I'll transfer.

875
01:16:10,148 --> 01:16:13,089
- Kate.
- Hey... Christian is looking for you.

876
01:16:13,189 --> 01:16:15,128
He called me at like 6 am.

877
01:16:15,163 --> 01:16:17,063
Ah. It's fine, he found me.

878
01:16:17,298 --> 01:16:19,393
What's going on? You okay?

879
01:16:20,306 --> 01:16:22,883
I'm just at work and I'm so busy.
Can I call you back?

880
01:16:22,919 --> 01:16:24,471
Okay.

881
01:16:24,671 --> 01:16:26,674
Hey, you know I am
here for you right?

882
01:16:27,653 --> 01:16:29,032
I know.

883
01:16:29,501 --> 01:16:31,326
Oh Anna.

884
01:16:31,361 --> 01:16:35,103
- Kate, don't.
- Talk later?

885
01:16:35,408 --> 01:16:37,768
- Yeah.
- Bye.

886
01:17:01,448 --> 01:17:05,080
- Hi Mia.
<i>- Damn, it's good to hear your voice.</i>

887
01:17:06,740 --> 01:17:07,815
Jack.

888
01:17:07,915 --> 01:17:10,652
Never got a chance to talk last week.
How the hell are you?

889
01:17:10,930 --> 01:17:13,701
How are you calling me?
You should be in...

890
01:17:13,802 --> 01:17:15,099
What? In jail?

891
01:17:15,299 --> 01:17:17,493
I'm out on bail, sweetheart.

892
01:17:18,974 --> 01:17:22,371
- This is Mia's phone
- It is, it is.

893
01:17:22,571 --> 01:17:24,312
Yeah, Cool spec too.

894
01:17:24,510 --> 01:17:28,212
Zeiss lenses,
20 megapixel camera.

895
01:17:28,247 --> 01:17:29,601
Oh my God.

896
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:31,691
Yeah, I picked her up
outside the gym.

897
01:17:31,726 --> 01:17:35,132
Seems like your husband's
security never learns.

898
01:17:35,167 --> 01:17:36,471
Jack, what do you want?

899
01:17:36,671 --> 01:17:39,220
<i>What do I want?
I want my life back Anna.</i>

900
01:17:39,255 --> 01:17:42,599
I could have been Christian Gray.
I'm smarter.

901
01:17:42,634 --> 01:17:46,174
<i>I have got more balls than him.
He had it so easy.</i>

902
01:17:46,209 --> 01:17:48,250
<i>They should have picked me.</i>

903
01:17:48,712 --> 01:17:50,273
That was supposed to be me.

904
01:17:51,596 --> 01:17:54,810
- These people, they owe me.
- What are you talking about?

905
01:17:56,077 --> 01:17:59,746
Forget about it. If you want
to see your sister-in-law again

906
01:17:59,781 --> 01:18:02,976
Get me five million by 1 pm.

907
01:18:03,264 --> 01:18:06,945
That's in less than two hours
Jack, that's completely impossible.

908
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:09,623
<i>Oh please,</i>
you are smart enough to take my job,

909
01:18:09,823 --> 01:18:11,087
you'll figure it out.

910
01:18:11,122 --> 01:18:13,575
And don't tell anybody,
not your husband.

911
01:18:13,610 --> 01:18:17,795
<i>Not his security, or you'll get
his little sister back in pieces.</i>

912
01:18:17,830 --> 01:18:19,427
Jesus Jack please.

913
01:18:19,613 --> 01:18:22,095
<i>- Keep your phone with you.</i>
- No, let me talk to Mia.

914
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:23,172
Jack.

915
01:18:26,936 --> 01:18:29,125
Oh my God.

916
01:18:52,189 --> 01:18:53,454
Hannah.

917
01:18:53,489 --> 01:18:57,224
Please clear my calender for the
rest of the day, I don't feel well.

918
01:18:57,259 --> 01:18:58,797
Sawyer, can you please take me home?

919
01:19:19,695 --> 01:19:22,691
- Yes?
- You know she actually bit me?

920
01:19:23,733 --> 01:19:25,552
I'm kind of turned on right now.

921
01:19:25,949 --> 01:19:28,280
Jesus Christ, Jack, I'm
doing what you asked.

922
01:19:28,315 --> 01:19:29,672
<i>The clock's ticking, Anna.</i>

923
01:19:29,820 --> 01:19:31,291
You need to grab some bags,

924
01:19:31,491 --> 01:19:33,780
5 million in cash
takes up a lot of space.

925
01:19:33,996 --> 01:19:35,914
Tick tock.

926
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:29,859
Yes, Mrs Gray.

927
01:20:29,894 --> 01:20:32,681
Sawyer, can you come help
me in the library please?

928
01:20:33,220 --> 01:20:34,983
On my way.

929
01:20:45,264 --> 01:20:46,597
Mrs Gray?

930
01:20:54,238 --> 01:20:55,824
Mrs. Gray
Anna!

931
01:20:55,859 --> 01:20:57,030
Fuck!

932
01:21:07,509 --> 01:21:09,728
She just ran out of the goddamn building.

933
01:21:09,763 --> 01:21:12,966
Fuck!

934
01:21:38,193 --> 01:21:40,560
Mrs. Gray, I am Troy William,
senior Manager.

935
01:21:40,661 --> 01:21:41,444
Hi.

936
01:21:41,544 --> 01:21:44,191
Mr. William, I'm very sorry
to bring this on you.

937
01:21:44,226 --> 01:21:46,308
But it's incredibly urgent.

938
01:21:47,411 --> 01:21:51,523
Well, for a large cash
transaction like this one,

939
01:21:51,716 --> 01:21:54,317
we have procedures we have to
follow, so they take time.

940
01:21:54,336 --> 01:21:56,702
I don't have time, I need
the money immediately.

941
01:21:58,136 --> 01:22:03,044
We might be able to... Do
you have identification?

942
01:22:10,331 --> 01:22:12,497
Okay. Thank you.

943
01:22:12,532 --> 01:22:15,880
Now you'll need to write a check
and I have to make a phone call.

944
01:22:21,743 --> 01:22:24,460
Mrs. Gray, it's your husband.

945
01:22:39,806 --> 01:22:41,645
- Christian?
- Anna.

946
01:22:41,866 --> 01:22:44,052
What's going on?
What are you doing?

947
01:22:44,087 --> 01:22:46,075
Is this about this morning?

948
01:22:49,393 --> 01:22:52,428
Anna, talk to me.
That's how this works, right?

949
01:22:52,656 --> 01:22:54,266
Tell me what's wrong.

950
01:22:54,799 --> 01:22:56,611
I can't.

951
01:23:02,741 --> 01:23:04,407
Are you leaving me?

952
01:23:10,861 --> 01:23:13,047
Wait for me there, I'll
will be in fifteen minutes.

953
01:23:13,583 --> 01:23:17,289
Christian, please. Don't.

954
01:23:18,661 --> 01:23:21,243
Anna, what's happening?

955
01:23:21,759 --> 01:23:23,298
This doesn't sound like you.

956
01:23:30,421 --> 01:23:31,614
Okay.

957
01:23:32,565 --> 01:23:34,592
Put William back on the phone.

958
01:23:48,584 --> 01:23:49,612
William.

959
01:23:49,712 --> 01:23:51,699
Give her whatever she wants,
do whatever she tells you.

960
01:23:51,734 --> 01:23:53,321
Yes, Mr. Gray

961
01:23:56,660 --> 01:24:00,111
Something's up. Anna's in trouble.
Head for the bank at first, hurry!

962
01:24:00,347 --> 01:24:01,682
Yes sir.

963
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:20,278
Come on baby, pick up.

964
01:24:20,518 --> 01:24:22,293
Pick up, please.

965
01:24:25,723 --> 01:24:28,445
Mrs. Gray,
sorry to keep you waiting.

966
01:24:30,894 --> 01:24:33,887
Sir, your sister Mia is missing

967
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,779
We can't find her.

968
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:43,609
They are quite heavy, Sam here
will take them to your car.

969
01:24:43,885 --> 01:24:46,022
- Shit.
- Is there a problem?

970
01:24:46,058 --> 01:24:48,507
- Can I make a phone call?

971
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:57,565
- Cutting it awfully close, Anna?
- Um, I have a problem.

972
01:24:57,915 --> 01:25:00,571
I know. You were
followed to the bank.

973
01:25:00,606 --> 01:25:01,790
How do you know that?

974
01:25:01,825 --> 01:25:04,787
There's a blue dodge
parked in the alley

975
01:25:04,822 --> 01:25:06,872
with tinted windows.

976
01:25:06,907 --> 01:25:08,189
Get in. You have 3 minutes.

977
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:11,468
- No, I need more time than that, Jack.
- Give the driver you cell.

978
01:25:11,503 --> 01:25:13,364
You won't be needing it anymore.

979
01:25:27,609 --> 01:25:29,802
I need to use your emergency exit.

980
01:25:29,837 --> 01:25:32,451
We don't usually.

981
01:25:32,901 --> 01:25:34,690
Yes, Mrs. Gray.

982
01:25:34,906 --> 01:25:36,748
I also need to borrow your phone.

983
01:25:40,754 --> 01:25:41,758
Thank you.

984
01:25:43,964 --> 01:25:47,085
He maid bail,
why wasn't I informed?

985
01:25:48,135 --> 01:25:50,976
Detective the same day that Hyde
gets out, my sister goes missing.

986
01:25:51,078 --> 01:25:53,668
And my wife takes $ 5
million out of our account.

987
01:25:53,703 --> 01:25:55,210
You think that's a coincidence?

988
01:25:57,933 --> 01:25:59,763
Liz

989
01:26:00,292 --> 01:26:02,079
Get in the back.

990
01:26:10,911 --> 01:26:12,272
Phone.

991
01:26:24,245 --> 01:26:27,411
Sir, she is gone.
Picked up in a blue car.

992
01:26:27,628 --> 01:26:30,728
- Damn it.
- Think it the same car that tailed you.

993
01:26:35,571 --> 01:26:37,193
They took her phone,
dropped it in the alley.

994
01:26:37,199 --> 01:26:38,233
It's not her phone.

995
01:26:38,433 --> 01:26:40,652
I am tracking her phone
and it's headed east.

996
01:26:44,453 --> 01:26:46,524
Liz, what are you doing?

997
01:26:46,559 --> 01:26:47,898
Why are you doing this?

998
01:26:47,933 --> 01:26:49,933
- Is he paying you?
- Shut up.

999
01:26:49,968 --> 01:26:51,884
South Michigan heading south.

1000
01:26:51,919 --> 01:26:53,012
Dispatch, get that?

1001
01:26:54,305 --> 01:26:56,456
<i>All units be advised. Suspect vehicle</i>

1002
01:26:56,656 --> 01:26:58,924
<i>headed south on 4th through Georgetown.</i>

1003
01:27:02,697 --> 01:27:06,329
Taylor, right here, over the bridge.

1004
01:27:21,585 --> 01:27:22,851
Oh, my God.

1005
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:30,721
No, no, no.

1006
01:27:31,031 --> 01:27:33,190
You made it 20 minutes to spare.

1007
01:27:33,225 --> 01:27:35,596
Jack, I brought you all the money.
It's all in the car.

1008
01:27:35,662 --> 01:27:38,110
- Just let me have Mia.
- We'll get to that.

1009
01:27:38,111 --> 01:27:40,901
You loose her phone?
Yeah, in the alley right by the bank.

1010
01:27:43,687 --> 01:27:44,809
Good.

1011
01:27:47,476 --> 01:27:49,830
They stopped, the signal stopped.

1012
01:27:49,865 --> 01:27:51,300
Carrie street north,
ten blocks, hurry.

1013
01:27:51,324 --> 01:27:54,161
<i>We have two units
converging on that area.</i>

1014
01:27:54,196 --> 01:27:55,447
<i>Going through in 3 minutes.</i>

1015
01:27:59,052 --> 01:28:00,899
Jack, please just let us go.

1016
01:28:02,953 --> 01:28:05,474
That's for you stuck up little bitch.

1017
01:28:05,509 --> 01:28:07,529
Thanks for fuckin' up my life.

1018
01:28:09,496 --> 01:28:11,649
Jesus, Jack, stop.

1019
01:28:11,684 --> 01:28:14,190
I did what you wanted, I gave
you what you asked for.

1020
01:28:14,225 --> 01:28:15,905
You think you can humiliate me?

1021
01:28:15,940 --> 01:28:17,627
- No.
- You bitch.

1022
01:28:17,662 --> 01:28:21,387
- Where's Christian now Anna?
- Jack, don't.

1023
01:28:21,671 --> 01:28:25,472
- You said you wouldn't kill her.
- And she's not dead, not yet.

1024
01:28:25,634 --> 01:28:26,984
You have the money. Leave her alone.

1025
01:28:27,184 --> 01:28:28,722
Fuck the money.
I don't give a shit about the money.

1026
01:28:28,734 --> 01:28:30,136
Enough.

1027
01:28:45,554 --> 01:28:47,090
Taylor, grab Mia.

1028
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:51,259
Anna, Anna, Anna,
can you hear me?

1029
01:28:54,674 --> 01:28:58,071
Wait...
Stay with me, Anna.

1030
01:28:58,378 --> 01:29:00,936
Anna.

1031
01:29:02,033 --> 01:29:05,178
Please be careful,
she's pregnant.

1032
01:29:08,366 --> 01:29:11,058
Please, stay back, Mr Grey.
Let us help your wife.

1033
01:29:45,276 --> 01:29:47,197
I am still awful to her, mom.

1034
01:29:47,413 --> 01:29:49,990
The things I said, I
wanna take 'em all back.

1035
01:29:52,535 --> 01:29:53,647
Sweetheart.

1036
01:29:53,825 --> 01:29:56,007
If there was no room in
marriage for mistakes

1037
01:29:56,207 --> 01:29:58,290
none of them would last
more than a week.

1038
01:29:59,567 --> 01:30:01,399
Tell her you are sorry.

1039
01:30:01,606 --> 01:30:04,979
You mean it,
then give her little time.

1040
01:30:06,186 --> 01:30:08,596
But I thought
she was leaving me.

1041
01:30:09,202 --> 01:30:10,830
Not this one.

1042
01:30:11,074 --> 01:30:13,218
She is tenacious.

1043
01:30:13,818 --> 01:30:16,233
Especially about things that she loves.

1044
01:30:16,433 --> 01:30:18,476
And she does love you, Christian.

1045
01:30:20,447 --> 01:30:22,841
You know that, don't you?

1046
01:30:23,353 --> 01:30:26,265
Yeah, yeah I do.

1047
01:30:26,420 --> 01:30:27,562
Good.

1048
01:30:32,763 --> 01:30:34,439
Oh, my sweetheart.

1049
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:49,814
- Anastasia.
- I will call Doctor.

1050
01:30:50,052 --> 01:30:53,348
Hey, how are you feeling?

1051
01:30:55,567 --> 01:30:59,129
- How is the baby?
- The baby is fine.

1052
01:31:00,516 --> 01:31:04,093
The baby's fine,
thank God!

1053
01:31:07,114 --> 01:31:09,160
Is Mia okay?

1054
01:31:09,195 --> 01:31:10,642
Yes.

1055
01:31:11,014 --> 01:31:12,730
Mia's fine.

1056
01:31:29,048 --> 01:31:32,093
Anna, I wanna have
this baby with you.

1057
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:34,642
I was just scared.

1058
01:31:35,816 --> 01:31:39,147
I wanted your world to
begin and end with me.

1059
01:31:39,617 --> 01:31:42,151
It does.

1060
01:31:43,507 --> 01:31:46,861
Christian, it does.
You're my whole life.

1061
01:31:51,434 --> 01:31:53,441
Are you crying?

1062
01:31:54,006 --> 01:31:55,764
Come here.

1063
01:32:11,653 --> 01:32:13,710
Why didn't ' you tell me
what was going on?

1064
01:32:16,089 --> 01:32:20,005
I couldn't.
Jack threatened me.

1065
01:32:20,088 --> 01:32:21,938
What happened to him?

1066
01:32:22,191 --> 01:32:23,648
He will live.

1067
01:32:24,350 --> 01:32:28,052
- I can't believe, I shot somebody.
- Should have aimed higher.

1068
01:32:31,187 --> 01:32:33,351
Liz was helping him.

1069
01:32:33,657 --> 01:32:37,566
Blackmailed.
She had sex with Hyde and he filmed it.

1070
01:32:37,803 --> 01:32:40,371
Seems he did that
with all this assistance.

1071
01:32:41,404 --> 01:32:42,789
Oh my God!

1072
01:32:48,623 --> 01:32:52,707
I know you think
you're gonna be a really shitty dad.

1073
01:32:53,986 --> 01:32:56,310
But you are not.

1074
01:32:57,380 --> 01:32:59,904
This baby is gonna love you.

1075
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:02,840
Unconditionally.

1076
01:33:05,946 --> 01:33:08,332
Just like you loved your mother.

1077
01:33:10,777 --> 01:33:12,641
You just have to forgive her.

1078
01:33:19,029 --> 01:33:21,606
<i>What is happening?
Are you cooking?</i>

1079
01:33:22,698 --> 01:33:24,947
Yeah, I got this.

1080
01:33:25,530 --> 01:33:27,428
Prepare to be amazed.

1081
01:33:35,904 --> 01:33:38,912
- What is this?
- It's more information of Hyde.

1082
01:33:39,204 --> 01:33:41,240
Open it.

1083
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:49,059
Look at his foster family.

1084
01:33:55,750 --> 01:33:58,534
That's Hyde.
That's me.

1085
01:33:58,569 --> 01:34:00,423
You were in a
Forster care with him?

1086
01:34:00,458 --> 01:34:01,939
I must have been.

1087
01:34:02,288 --> 01:34:05,396
Do you remember these people,
do you know these kids?

1088
01:34:05,431 --> 01:34:08,370
I barely remember anything before
I was adopted, I was too young.

1089
01:34:08,620 --> 01:34:11,669
That must have been what he meant
when he said you owe him a life.

1090
01:34:11,887 --> 01:34:14,442
Because your parents
adopted you and not him.

1091
01:34:24,315 --> 01:34:25,972
What's going on?

1092
01:34:28,593 --> 01:34:30,730
If I'd been left in the system

1093
01:34:32,949 --> 01:34:35,127
who knows how I'd have turned out?

1094
01:34:35,696 --> 01:34:38,288
That could be me, maybe
that should have been me.

1095
01:34:38,567 --> 01:34:40,634
Hey, no.

1096
01:34:40,890 --> 01:34:43,352
You are nothing like him.

1097
01:34:45,075 --> 01:34:48,137
You were given a life
with advantages, yes...

1098
01:34:48,172 --> 01:34:49,332
but

1099
01:34:49,596 --> 01:34:51,590
look what you made of it.

1100
01:34:53,095 --> 01:34:55,077
You're man of honor.

1101
01:34:56,518 --> 01:34:58,958
And you treat people well.

1102
01:34:59,685 --> 01:35:01,199
You care.

1103
01:35:01,253 --> 01:35:04,011
No one could ever say that
about a man like Hyde.

1104
01:35:04,046 --> 01:35:05,278
No matter who raised him.

1105
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:11,743
I love you.

1106
01:35:13,551 --> 01:35:16,421
Yeah, if you could only cook,
you'd be perfect.

1107
01:35:16,605 --> 01:35:18,224
Oh God, okay...

1108
01:35:22,186 --> 01:35:24,645
Fuck it, let's get take out.

1109
01:35:32,289 --> 01:35:33,951
- Christian
- Yeah?

1110
01:35:34,839 --> 01:35:38,906
It seems like they have found where
your birth mother is buried.

1111
01:38:01,205 --> 01:38:04,598
<i>Sir, I await your pleasure.</i>

1112
01:38:17,370 --> 01:38:19,096
So you wanna play?

1113
01:38:20,146 --> 01:38:21,731
Yes sir.

1114
01:38:28,863 --> 01:38:31,344
You're tapping from
the bottom, Mrs. Gray.

1115
01:38:33,572 --> 01:38:36,214
But I can live with that.

1116
01:38:40,062 --> 01:38:44,621


1117
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:11,777
<i>There she is, now give a big kiss OK?
Give mommy a big kiss.</i>

1118
01:39:11,812 --> 01:39:16,092
<i>Come here... Hi!</i>
