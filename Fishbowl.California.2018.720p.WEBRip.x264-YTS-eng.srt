00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,640
Tess.

2
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:44,543
Your air mattress is deflating again.

3
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,678
Okay.

4
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:49,214
Have you seen my other shoe?

5
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,650
It's hiding from you.
Wants you to come back to bed.

6
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:53,819
As tempting as that sounds,

7
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,555
I have to go somewhere where
there's air conditioning before I melt.

8
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:59,358
You know, we can solve this really easily

9
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,128
if we just moved in together.

10
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:06,298
It's been six months, Tess.

11
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,601
I'm ready for a bigger commitment.

12
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:13,673
Rodney, you can't even find
time to name your goldfish.

13
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,615
Found it. All right. One more
kiss for the road. Come on.

14
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:25,384
Get over here!
No...

15
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:28,220
I can't!

16
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:31,090
I hato go. No, look,
I'm letting you go.

17
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,192
Look, this is me letting you go.
Come here.

18
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:35,227
Oh, my God.
What?

19
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:37,830
Morning breath!
Ohh!

20
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:41,633
That's your cue.
Yeah.

21
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:45,404
Why don't you put it in
the same spot every time?

22
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,342
Got it.

23
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:52,377
That is for...
Job.

24
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:53,879
Job interview.

25
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,349
Holy shit. I can do this.
Okay, help me up. Help me up.

Oh! Hey, little man. Sorry about that.
It's no trouble.

37
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:43,729
But I do need an update
about the rent.

38
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,166
We need one of those three
back-payments pronto.

39
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,202
One more week, I promise.
Please... lock the door.

40
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:51,436
Oh!

41
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:54,439
Sorry about that.
Thanks, Charlie.

42
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,575
And I don't know if a week
is going to cut it.

43
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:59,344
Mom was using all sorts
of colorful language

44
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:03,348
this morning to describe you,
and none of it was good.

45
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,884
Five days, then. I'm on my
way to a job interview now.

46
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:09,188
Even if you get a job, you
probably won't get your paycheck

47
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,856
until two weeks from now.

48
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,525
Good point.
We'll figure it out.

49
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,361
I'll talk to her.
It'd be a shame to lose you.

50
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,964
Yes. Say that, plus other
nice things about me.

51
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:22,467
I don't care if they're lies.
Just make 'em nice.

52
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:24,703
Very odd that you're always
working in that little bunker.

53
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,273
Good luck!
Thank you!

54
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:30,976
Open, door.

55
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:34,480
Oh, got to get you fixed.
Yes, I do.

56
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,616
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

57
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,952
Phil brought in steak fajitas
for casual Friday,

58
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,955
so I wanted to get in there
before the interns ravaged them.

59
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,457
They smell delicious.
I'm Rodney.

60
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,693
Susan.

61
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:58,797
So, according to this résumé,

62
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,566
the longest job you've held
is six weeks.

63
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,769
Well, technically
it was nine weeks,

64
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:08,507
but they were two-day weeks
for, like, five hours a day.

65
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:11,643
And the one before that?
A week?

66
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,446
It was a 60-hour week.

67
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,682
Look, before we get into...

68
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,817
office politics,

69
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,720
can we talk...
salary

70
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:24,556
or s... I don't think
we're there yet.

71
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:27,326
No, no. I don't mean
to just zoom into that,

72
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,429
but, you know, obviously
I was thinking 60. Thou?

73
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,730
Thou?
..sand.

74
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:33,465
Sand.
Like, thousand?

75
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:36,568
Like, thousand.

76
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:40,439
No, I'm a reasonable guy. I'm
willing to negotiate by a few.

77
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,341
"A few"?

78
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,912
Few. I don't
want to undersell myself.

79
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,548
Wait.

80
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:52,685
Did Danny set you up for this?

81
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,620
Who's Danny?

82
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:57,622
You don't have a college degree,

83
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:59,691
and you don't have any experience,
and this is an assistant position.

84
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,594
I was shocked that you guys
called me in, too, a little bit.

85
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:05,964
I mean, an "assistant CEO"
sounds really important.

86
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:08,667
Assistant to the CEO. "To."

87
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,036
No, no, I'm pretty sure the guy on
the phone said "assistant CEO."

88
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,639
Okay, that would be my current
assistant, right there.

89
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,844
Oh. We got eye contact.
Just ignore him. Hmm?

90
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:22,013
Look at me. Don't look back Don't look...
You need somethin'?

91
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:23,749
Hello?

92
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,550
Just look at me. Don't look back.
Okay.

93
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,120
If we stay still long
enough, he will go away.

94
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:33,625
Can you hear me?

95
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:35,161
Susan?

96
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:38,531
Susan!

97
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:41,566
Susan, can you hear me?

98
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,468
Every day.

99
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:44,770
Susan!

100
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:47,540
Harry, don't you have
work to do?

101
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:50,642
No.

102
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:52,677
What else would be the point
of casual Fridays?

103
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:54,647
Fuck this job.

104
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:58,517
Is that who
I'm competing against?

105
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:01,153
Essentially.
I am...

106
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,723
liking my chances.

107
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:08,460
Well, I don't intend on replacing
one idiot with another.

108
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:11,430
Right, right.
Oh, Jesus, he's back.

109
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,032
Hey, I spilled coffee
on the copier.

110
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:17,737
It's busted.
That's on me.

111
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:25,143
Is now a good time
to talk salary, or...

112
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:35,020
Do you have any
bartending experience?

113
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,189
Personally, I have a lot more

114
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,927
bar-attending experience.

115
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,862
Oh, come on.
That was funny.

116
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:45,997
Okay, let's try this again.

117
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:49,668
How do you make a, uh, mojito?

118
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:52,471
Tequi... Gin.

119
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,206
Rum.

120
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,475
And... other stuff.

121
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,710
I'm more of
a whiskey fan myself.

122
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:01,813
All right, so, uh, how do
you make a whiskey sour?

123
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:06,685
Whiskey, whiskey, and a jealous ex-lover.
Am I right?

124
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,621
'Cause it's sour?

125
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,157
Okay, I'm going to get going.

126
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:16,628
I got a, uh, massage
in 15 minutes.

127
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,663
It's one of those...

128
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,532
you know.

129
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:24,769
Ugh. That kind where they walk
on your back with bare feet?

130
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,073
I'll be in touch.

131
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,685
Hey, hey!

132
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,554
Hey.

133
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:45,024
How'd that one go?
Did you get it?

134
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,633
Practically gave it
to me on the spot.

135
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,735
What?

136
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,907
Congratulations!
I am so proud of you!

137
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,708
Oh, it wasn't anything.

138
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,111
Oh, it's so good!
I'm so impressed!

139
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:09,714
So, what's... what's this?
Are we celebrating?

140
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,851
Oh, it's just a little
this and that.

141
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,753
Here.

142
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:17,756
Oh, yeah.
Cheers.

143
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:20,659
Oh, I can get you...
a glass.

144
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,794
Oh, God, that's good.
Slow down, slow down.

145
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:24,196
It's really good.

146
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:32,705
There you go.

147
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,176
All right, put the money
in the bag!

148
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:40,345
Oh, shit. Don't shoot.

149
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,847
Yeah, hurry up, or I'll
blow your brains out! No.

150
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:45,750
Look, do as I say,
and no one gets hu...

151
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,819
Holy shit, you're huge.

152
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,123
Billy Coburn?
Is that you?

153
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:54,793
No. Just step
the hell back.

154
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,661
Hell, hell, hell.

155
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:59,064
I'd recognize
that voice anywhere.

156
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:02,267
This boy used to be
the best soprano

157
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,102
St. Matt's choir
ever had.

158
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,005
Till he hit puberty,
and then down he went.

159
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:09,774
Now he's with the tenors.

160
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,377
Damn it, June.

161
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:15,981
Excuse me.

162
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,917
I'm sorry. Mrs. Fleming.
I'm sorry.

163
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:21,753
That's better.

164
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:23,355
Your poor mother

165
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:25,824
would be puking in her grave
if she knew what you were up to.

166
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:28,226
Explain yourself.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Fleming.

167
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,261
It's just, you know Claudia?

168
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:32,797
She's pregnant again,
and it's twins this time.

169
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,834
Aren't you the stud.
Thank you.

170
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:38,770
But it's just,
how am I supposed to feed

171
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:41,172
my entire family on a
kindergarten teacher's salary?

172
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:43,842
You know? And then my dad's
disability ran out...

173
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:47,946
This is not the way, Billy.

174
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,981
I know.
Damn straight you know.

175
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:53,918
Okay, now, you just get
your kiester home.

176
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,855
You're... You're not
gonna call the...

177
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:59,824
No, Chad's not going to call the cops.
Are you, Chad?

178
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,760
Yes, the hell I am.

179
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:04,362
Let's try that again.

180
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:08,066
You're not going to
call the cops on this

181
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:12,972
downtrodden, very loyal
husband and father.

182
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:15,974
Chad?

183
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,409
No.
Louder.

184
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,010
No.

185
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,880
Thank you.
Thank you.

186
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,882
Don't you ever let me hear

187
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:26,851
that you're involved in
this sort of shit again, okay?

188
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,221
Yes, ma'am.
'Cause if I do,

189
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:33,925
my hand is going to go

190
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:36,461
so far up your ass,

191
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,930
I'm going to be able to
pull out your teeth

192
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:41,299
one by one.

193
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,802
Got it?
Yes, ma'am.

194
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:45,137
All right. Now get.

195
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:52,744
You know I could've
taken him, right?

196
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,980
You can get the next one.

197
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:12,330
Good morning, my working man.

198
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:14,432
You'd better get up and get going.
You're going to be late.

199
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:17,102
Late for what?

200
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:18,937
Uh, your new job.

201
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:21,873
Oh. Right.

202
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,241
Yeah, yeah.

203
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,477
Late on my first day?
That'd be bad.

204
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,445
Listen...

205
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:29,914
I, uh, I got to get going.
I'm going to be late.

206
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,150
You good?
Yeah.

207
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:34,519
Okay. Lock the door
on your way out.

208
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,221
Yeah.

209
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,840
Hey, neighbor.
How you been?

210
00:12:55,841 --> 00:13:00,211
It's great to see you
out and about this morning.

211
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:03,081
Listen, I never got
your response back

212
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:04,883
regarding reinstating
neighborhood watch.

213
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:08,019
I sent a few letters out
but never heard back. Oh.

214
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,089
It probably got lost in the mail.
It doesn't matter.

215
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,958
I got another form for you.

216
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,895
Right. Uh,
I'll file that.

217
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,329
Fantastic.

218
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:22,100
Oh, and I couldn't help
but notice your yard.

219
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:24,102
I got to be honest, June,

220
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:27,473
it's seen better days...
Even months.

221
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:31,476
Is that all, Woody?

222
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,245
I mean, curb appeal
is important, you know?

223
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:36,347
And we don't want
the property values

224
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,349
in this neighborhood going down.

225
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,019
I mean, look,
the-the bushes

226
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,288
out there in front,
they're growing so tall.

227
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,824
Those should just be trimmed.
Uh-huh.

228
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,927
So that, you know, you want
people to see your house.

229
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:51,529
Like right over here,
this is all so dry.

230
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:55,233
Used to be all lilies, and now
it looks like Afghanistan.

231
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:58,570
And the geraniums are...

232
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:01,139
desperately trying
to stay alive.

233
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,208
And, I don't know,

234
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,210
my heart just breaks for 'em.

235
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:09,080
Your heart breaks for them?

236
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:11,082
And...

237
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,985
your bougainvilleas on this wall are dead.
That needs to be...

238
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:17,288
What is the matter with you? Do
you have Asperger's or some shit?

239
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:20,859
I mean, can you not read

240
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,128
the writing on my face?

241
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:27,565
Get the fuck away from me.

242
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:30,134
You don't care about me,
I don't care about you,

243
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:31,936
so you have a great day,
and I won't.

244
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:33,471
Well, I hope...
Thanks for the paper.

245
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:35,907
I hope you do have a great day.

246
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:37,475
And, you know,

247
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:41,145
remember, if you see
something, say something.

248
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:44,183
Woody.
I see something.

249
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,019
I see a jackass.

250
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:51,523
You don't have to be
such a twat, June.

251
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,094
You're a twat.

252
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:02,134
A delight, as always, Woody.

253
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:21,446
Jun you've reached the Flemings,

254
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:24,315
Jim and June,
and we're not here right now.

255
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,317
Leave a message.
We'll get back to ya.

256
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:29,120
Not a long one though.
Bye.

257
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:34,659
Mom, are you there
and just not picking up?

258
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,627
Damn straight.

259
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:39,163
Mom, I'm...
I'm worried about you.

260
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:42,467
You haven't returned
my call in... in weeks,

261
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,736
and I have no idea
what's going on.

262
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:47,739
Call me, okay?

263
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,775
I love you.

264
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,727
Hey, dude.

265
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:12,464
Either buy something or get out.

266
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:27,545
I'll take a regular
cup of coffee.

267
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,347
Our medium is a grande.

268
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:31,616
Did you want to do a grande?
That's fine.

269
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:34,652
Uh, what else?
That's it.

270
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:38,756
Uh, we have a $10 minimum here.
The free Wi-Fi.

271
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:42,460
That doesn't make sense. I'll
have a brownie. Good choice.

272
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:44,328
Oh, you made it. 12.50.

273
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:46,130
12.50?
Mm-hmm.

274
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:49,568
For a medium cup of coffee
and a brownie? Exactly.

275
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:58,644
That one got declined.
Hmm.

276
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:02,313
Let's try this one.

277
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:05,183
Also declined.

278
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:12,323
Third time's a charm.

279
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:14,793
No.

280
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:17,295
This is fun.
We could do this all day.

281
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,629
Can you guys taper this off?

282
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,765
I got to teach a spin class
down the street.

283
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,667
You need to wait your turn, sir.

284
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:25,336
And are we done here,
or you got anything else?

285
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:28,306
How about a...
free refill?

286
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:31,242
You didn't pay for that.
Fuck you.

287
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:34,378
Hey, bud, you forgot your laptop.

288
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:38,316
Hey, you forgot your laptop!

289
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:42,820
You forgot your computer!

290
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:46,658
Fuck you... I don't even care. I'm
going to steal that computer.

291
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,506
How's the bread?

292
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:04,375
Mm. Good. You want?

293
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:07,311
No. I had a big breakfast.

294
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:10,281
Then why invite me to lunch?

295
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,917
Well, because there's a few
things we have to talk about.

296
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:16,521
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wait, wait.
Let me guess.

297
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:19,390
You're worried about me.

298
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:21,526
Well, yes.
Mm-hmm.

299
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:24,495
Uh, you think I'm not taking care
of myself since your dad died.

300
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,764
Am I right?

301
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:29,667
And the house, it's in a
complete disarray... Oh, Ollie.

302
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,802
Your dad was the neat freak.

303
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:34,672
To tell you the truth,
he was a little OCD.

304
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:38,177
I'm, uh, more, uh, CGS.

305
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,713
"Could give a shit."

306
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:46,350
I am sorry I have not been over
as much as I used to,

307
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,554
but I am putting in 60 hours
a week in the hospital.

308
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:52,423
It's too much, Ollie.

309
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:56,394
Take care of yourself, huh? I
mean, even God took a day off.

310
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:58,429
God didn't have you as a mother.

311
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,499
Just let someone help you.

312
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,769
I'll think about it.

313
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,406
Okay? Promise.

314
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:12,476
Son of a...

315
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:23,554
I feel like I'm just
floating by, you know?

316
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,590
One day I want to do this.

317
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:29,527
Next day it's something else.

318
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,562
I guess I just need
some guidance.

319
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,365
Go with your gut.

320
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:37,935
Right now, all my gut's
saying is "feed me."

321
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:40,938
Maybe you should get
a job at a restaurant.

322
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:44,642
So, what do you want to do
when you grow up?

323
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:47,979
Eh, in this economy,
hard to say right now.

324
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,449
Got to see how it plays out.

325
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,385
That makes sense.

326
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:57,989
With that being said, I ran
the numbers with my mom,

327
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,991
and we can't swing it, Rodney.

328
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:03,395
It's time to move out, ASAP.

329
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,467
I appreciate you
going to bat for me.

330
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:11,335
No problem.

331
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:15,373
By the way, you need
a new carburetor.

332
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:18,343
May have to downgrade
to Rollerblades.

333
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,599
Hello.

334
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:45,504
Tessie?

335
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,910
Shh! Tess?

336
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:56,647
Your new roommate's here.

337
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,582
<i>♪ Your roommate is here ♪</i>

338
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,551
<i>♪ Your roommate is here ♪</i>

339
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:03,821
<i>♪ Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Where is my Tessie? ♪</i>

340
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,991
Tess?

341
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:10,428
Jeez, Rodney, what... what
the hell are you doing?

342
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:13,497
To what do I owe this...
pleasure?

343
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,534
What's going on? Why-Why is
your stuff here? What...

344
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:20,571
I thought me and this little guy
could come over for a talk.

345
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:23,407
Maybe a fresh start.

346
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:27,679
Is the pizza already here? Oh, man,
you are one fast delivery guy.

347
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:33,351
Wait. Where's... Where's the pizza?
Who's this guy?

348
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,488
Rodney... No! Eh,
eh, eh, eh-eh, eh!

349
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:40,658
Who the hell are you?
Who the hell are you?!

350
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:42,461
I'm Keith.

351
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:47,498
I'm sorry, but...

352
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:49,667
is this some sort of
a sick joke?

353
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:51,569
Just shut up!

354
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:55,039
God, you give me
such a headache sometimes!

355
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,576
So you're really not the pizza guy?

356
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:02,646
Look.

357
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:05,716
Maybe this is
some sort of a weird...

358
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,386
speed bump in our relationship

359
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,954
that soon will pass.

360
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:13,691
No, Rodney. It's not
a speed bump.

361
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:16,761
Think of it as a
permanent road closure.

362
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:19,831
What?
Sorry, dude.

363
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:29,407
How long has this... fling
been going on?

364
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,943
Five months. We have only
been dating for six months.

365
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:35,847
What do you want me to say?

366
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:46,023
Look, Rodney, I...

367
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:48,025
I can't keep taking care of you.

368
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:51,429
I need to be provided for,
and Keith is responsible.

369
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,098
He's a pilot.
She breached the cockpit.

370
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,833
He literally takes care of

371
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:58,002
hundreds of lives
every single day,

372
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:00,738
and you can't even take care
of an unnamed goldfish.

373
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,574
Sushi.

374
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:04,708
What?

375
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:07,445
The fish.
I named him Sushi.

376
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,849
You said if I named him, you'd
think about moving in with me.

377
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:14,552
I wasn't serious.

378
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:16,587
You're breaking my heart.

379
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:18,656
I'm sorry.
No. No.

380
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,624
Whoa! Sushi!

381
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:23,194
Sushi needs water!
Where-Where is he?

382
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:26,864
I don't know.
Sushi! Where'd he go?

383
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:29,900
Oh, God. I don't even know
how that happened.

384
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:31,635
How what happened?

385
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:39,944
Can I have a moment
alone here, please?

386
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:42,681
Take all the time
you need, brother.

387
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:45,750
I appreciate that, Keith.

388
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:48,019
Right.

389
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:18,182
How can we just let him
stay in the bathroom like that?

390
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:21,018
What if he tries
to kill himself?

391
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,721
He's going through
a rough time right now.

392
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:25,256
It's a fish!

393
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:27,124
His fish.

394
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:28,926
No.

395
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:30,828
I'll do it.
I'll check on him.

396
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:36,034
Give it, like, a minute. If I
hear weird sounds...

397
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:43,707
Oh!

398
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,843
Shit!

399
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:48,713
Arrrr!

400
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:19,070
Uhh!

401
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,835
Mm-hmm.

402
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:54,773
Okay, buddy.

403
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:03,214
I'm parched too.

404
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,860
You too, baby.

405
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:20,265
Happy.

406
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:31,710
What in the...
devil stick is this?

407
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:43,054
Where the hell does this go?

408
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:59,002
Jimmy Buffett.

409
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:02,339
Hey. You know, it's rude to just
snatch something away from somebody,

410
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,475
especially
while they're napping.

411
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:07,444
Rude?

412
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:10,114
Right.
This from that punk

413
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:12,182
who outright stole
my electricity.

414
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:15,886
You know, you'd better get your ass
out of here before I get my gun.

415
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:17,955
You have a gun?

416
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:19,189
Uh-huh. Three.

417
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:22,026
Lola... Ooh,
she's my favorite.

418
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:37,040
Small problem.

419
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:39,209
My car appears to be broken.

420
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,512
Then I tried calling for help
before my phone died,

421
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:44,248
which prompted me to borrow...
Steal.

422
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:47,985
Steal your power just long
enough to charge my phone.

423
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:49,987
You entitled punk!

424
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:53,123
You know, we all got problems, kid.
Take 'em someplace else.

425
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:56,561
I'm sick of looking at
that old hunk of shit.

426
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:01,031
I could say the same thing
about you.

427
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:02,900
Oh.

428
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:05,536
Oh, that is good.

429
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:08,071
That is so good.
I'm calling the cops.

430
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:11,910
Okay, that's really unnecessary. I'm
sure we could work something out.

431
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:19,116
Don't test me. Not testing.
Not testing.

432
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:21,985
Is everything okay, June?

433
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,322
Fuck off, Woody.

434
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,595
Yow!

435
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:33,397
Okay, look, look, look, look.

436
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:35,566
I have a proposition.
You have grass.

437
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:38,101
Everybody's grass needs cut.

438
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:40,838
So how about in exchange
for your, uh,

439
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:44,007
borrowed power, I...

440
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,243
Stolen power,

441
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:49,314
I'd be more than willing
to lend my labor.

442
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:58,055
Okay.

443
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:00,891
Okay, but you've got to do
some other shit too.

444
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:04,995
Speaking of shit...
like clean my toilets.

445
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:06,997
I don't do toilets.

446
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:10,168
And I don't do you.

447
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:14,304
Look, Liz?
Jer. Is that you?

448
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:17,040
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
You win.

449
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:20,010
Jerry, hold on.
Say that again.

450
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:22,079
You win.

451
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,215
Jer, I'll call you back.

452
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,657
Hey.

453
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:09,693
Don't cut your toes off,
asshole.

Hello.

464
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,651
Hmph.

465
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:11,288
When am I allowed to take my
state-mandated 30-minute break?

466
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:14,691
God, I hate you.

467
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:16,761
Mm.

468
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,632
Tuna salad sandwich.

469
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:28,005
Yummy.

470
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:33,010
Is this tuna of the can?

471
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,579
No. I caught it.

472
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,114
Impressive.

473
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:40,183
Is there... anything else
on the menu?

474
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,219
Nada.

475
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,721
Well, I don't really let

476
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:47,591
processed bullshit into my body.
Watch your goddamn mouth.

477
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:50,428
You watch your goddamn mouth.

478
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:57,602
Hmm.

479
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,439
This smells like a dead corpse.

480
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,443
You really are an ungrateful
little bitch, aren't you?

481
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,712
Well, you're
an old-ass bitch.

482
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:14,185
I'll just eat the chips.

483
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:21,792
Five-letter word for "spoon."

484
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:24,429
Ladle?

485
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:39,509
That's it, bud.
Wrap it up.

486
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,679
That's enough for today.

487
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:46,717
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

488
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:52,289
Get that.

489
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,825
That.

490
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:15,378
Thanks for the laughs.
Have a nice life, huh?

491
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:19,249
You too.
I'm Rodney, by the way.

492
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,717
Really?

493
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:23,120
I thought your name was Asshole.

494
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,326
I'm June.

495
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:31,529
Dumpster's that way.

496
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:48,178
Okay.
Uh...

497
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:54,384
Set the winners aside
just for you.

498
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:56,786
Now, if you win, I want my cut.

499
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:58,722
Fair enough.

500
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:01,324
All set.
Thanks, Chad.

501
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,393
Have a good night, June.

502
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:07,164
Yep. I'll see you
tomorrow.

503
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,466
Get home safe.

504
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:29,854
Why are you still here?

505
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:35,525
I think I, uh, left my
wallet inside your house.

506
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:38,529
Thought you didn't have
any money.

507
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:41,432
Oh, I don't.

508
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:45,469
So why do you need
an empty wallet?

509
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:50,540
I guess I don't.

510
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:53,444
Guess I'll just hit
the sidewalk.

511
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:03,454
You can have, um,

512
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:06,724
three of these.

513
00:37:07,658 --> 00:37:09,894
Domestic or import?

514
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,631
Don't push it.

515
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:25,742
She'd been
cheating on me for months.

516
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:28,678
Months.

517
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:30,947
And if that wasn't bad enough,

518
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:32,749
then Sushi died.

519
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,552
What, your dog?
No, my goldfish.

520
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:38,455
May she float in peace.

521
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:39,823
Hey!

522
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:43,794
Sushi and I had
a swimmingly good time together.

523
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:51,935
So, would you take her back?

524
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,570
Sushi?

525
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:57,040
No, the bitch.

526
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:59,576
Aren't we not supposed to call
women bitches anymore?

527
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:01,511
Like, feminism
or something like...

528
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:05,815
No. You are not supposed
to call women bitches.

529
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:09,320
But me?
A cunt is a cunt.

530
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,297
Hoo!

531
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:23,466
You didn't answer my question.
You asked a question?

532
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:27,304
I did. Would...
Would you take her back?

533
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,440
Yep.
Mm-hmm.

534
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:32,343
No.

535
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:36,079
Maybe.

536
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,715
That's a yes.

537
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:42,452
She was just really, really,

538
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:45,555
really... hot.

539
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:48,959
Men are so stupid.

540
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:52,396
What about your husband?

541
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:56,434
Dead.

542
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:59,536
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

543
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:01,037
Uh-huh.

544
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:02,839
When did he pass?

545
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,508
God!

546
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,677
I hate that word.

547
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:10,613
"Pass." I mean,
like death is as easy

548
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:13,516
as-as-as passing gas.

549
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:16,519
I mean, stupid assholes,
you know?

550
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,122
They... They...
They use another word

551
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:22,492
to make it seem like it's okay,

552
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:25,029
but, you know, he's dead.

553
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:29,967
D-E-A-D.

554
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:33,738
Dead.

555
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,943
So, what's your story, huh?

556
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:42,912
I grew up in
the foster care system.

557
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:45,882
Hmm. That must've
been tough.

558
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,418
Eh.

559
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,556
Ah.

560
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:55,493
So,

561
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:59,930
you want to watch
an Antiques Roadshow?

562
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:03,466
I'm gonna need
another one of those.

563
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:04,834
Me too.

564
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:07,504
Come on. Now, just like
I showed you. Okay.

565
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:22,520
Uhh.

566
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:49,906
I'll need an initial here, here,

567
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:52,142
and sign and date here.

568
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,754
Still the 28th, right?

569
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:07,123
Yes.

570
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:10,693
Great. Well, let me know
if anything changes.

571
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:13,898
Good seeing you.
You too.

572
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:33,017
Um, hi?

573
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:35,852
Hello there,

574
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:38,821
uh, strange person.

575
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:40,324
Hey there.

576
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:42,692
What are you doing?

577
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:46,062
Just, uh, putting some

578
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:48,831
finishing touches on my place.

579
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:50,733
This is your place?

580
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,835
Well, it's, uh,

581
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:54,938
more of an investment property.

582
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:57,874
It's a foreclosure.
Probably gonna flip it.

583
00:42:57,875 --> 00:42:59,944
I'm Rodney, by the way.

584
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:09,286
Hey, where are you going?

585
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,925
Who's this?

586
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:19,796
That's the help.

587
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:21,798
Really?

588
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:24,735
I'm gonna take this personally
here in a second. A word?

589
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,758
Unh.

590
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:50,893
So nice to see you, sweetheart.

591
00:43:50,894 --> 00:43:53,864
I love these sweatpants.
What is this, the 20th day in a row?

592
00:43:57,101 --> 00:43:59,802
Mom, these are all full.

593
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:02,706
Have you even taken
a single pill?

594
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:06,242
Mom, this is your life.

595
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:09,912
If you read, you will
see that it says,

596
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:12,849
"Do not mix the pills
with the booze."

597
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:14,851
So I'm just following
directions.

598
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:17,220
Oh, then lay off the booze, Mom.
It's simple.

599
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:19,155
Honey,

600
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:21,791
if I cold-turkey quit,
that will kill me.

601
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:25,828
Just let me have
whatever I need, okay,

602
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:28,698
to enjoy the rest of my life.

603
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:30,199
God. That's crazy.

604
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,068
Here I was actually thinking
you were listening

605
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:33,903
to what I was saying
at lunch the other day.

606
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:35,905
I was listening.

607
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:37,407
You said, "Get somebody

608
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:39,842
to help out around the house,"
so I did, look.

609
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:42,912
Helping himself to lunch!

610
00:44:42,913 --> 00:44:44,814
Is he actually homeless?

611
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:48,851
Hey! Zip it. You
are homeless, remember?

612
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:52,255
Is there any garlic sauce?
That is for her, not you.

613
00:44:52,256 --> 00:44:55,258
This is actually pretty good.
Out.

614
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:03,800
This is your life.

615
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:23,252
Hello again.
Please don't yell at me.

616
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:26,322
I think we got off
on the wrong foot here.

617
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:29,325
Look, I'm not here
to steal your mom's shit

618
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:32,762
or take advantage of her
or anything like that, okay?

619
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:36,032
I promise. Can you
do me a small favor?

620
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:37,934
Sure.

621
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:40,236
Do you think you can try

622
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,839
and get my mom to take her meds?

623
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,007
Yeah, no problem.

624
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:47,310
Seems easy, but it's not.

625
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:49,879
Are you saying that
June is stubborn? Gasp.

626
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,014
Trick her like a dog.

627
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:53,449
Seriously?

628
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:55,952
Doctor's orders.
Hey, Olivia.

629
00:45:55,953 --> 00:45:58,122
Hey, Floyd.

630
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:07,765
See you in Pilates.
Oh, yeah.

631
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:31,288
How many dead cats are in here?

632
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:58,114
You think darkness is your ally,

633
00:46:58,115 --> 00:47:00,917
but you merely adopted it.

634
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:03,886
I was born into it.

635
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:05,521
Molded by it.

636
00:47:05,522 --> 00:47:10,059
I didn't see the light
until I was already a man.

637
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:13,596
But by then it was nothing
to me but blinding!

638
00:47:13,597 --> 00:47:16,065
How long have you been
standing there?

639
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:18,302
You're a weird little man.

640
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:26,275
There's a ton
of cool shit in here.

641
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:30,112
Really? Who the hell
do you think put it here?

642
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:31,981
Check this out.

643
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:42,525
This is how Jim and I met.
Really?

644
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:46,530
I see this handsome guy ride by.

645
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:51,167
I whistled.

646
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:54,170
He stopped.

647
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:56,006
I got on.

648
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:59,643
And never got off.

649
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:18,294
<i>♪ Supper's almost ready ♪</i>

650
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:20,296
<i>♪ Supper's
almost ready ♪</i>

651
00:48:20,297 --> 00:48:22,198
<i>♪ Rodney ♪</i>

652
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:24,066
<i>♪ Supper made that Rodney ♪</i>

653
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:26,503
<i>♪ Rodney made the supper ♪</i>

654
00:48:28,505 --> 00:48:31,108
Well, supper's almost ready.

655
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:38,114
Hmm.
What's on the menu?

656
00:48:38,115 --> 00:48:41,384
Doesn't smell half bad.

657
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:43,120
Mmm!

658
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:50,126
Well, the old bitch can be
nice when she wants to be.

659
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:54,063
I like to call it...
Rodney Surprise.

660
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:56,232
Ah.
It's pasta with...

661
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:59,970
Uh, uh, uh!
Don't spoil the surprise.

662
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:07,510
So, why don't you invite
a friend for dinner?

663
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:11,315
I mean, that is
if you've got any.

664
00:49:12,683 --> 00:49:14,550
Yeah, sure.

665
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:17,253
I think I know someone
who can make it.

666
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:20,023
<i>♪ Supper's almost ready ♪</i>

667
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:28,230
Oh, June, drink up!

668
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:31,367
You are in the liquor penalty box
right now. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

669
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:35,538
Ew! That did not
look good.

670
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:38,708
Okay. Boy, we are running
low on the old hooch.

671
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:41,277
Oh, can't you pussies keep up?

672
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:43,746
What does that mean?

673
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:46,115
That means we're her friends.

674
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:48,718
Uh-huh.

675
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:52,288
Okay, I think I saw a bottle
of something in the garage.

676
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:53,389
All right.
Be right back.

677
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:56,092
You'd better.

678
00:49:56,093 --> 00:49:58,461
So,

679
00:49:58,462 --> 00:50:01,564
shark attack, shark attack,

680
00:50:01,565 --> 00:50:04,101
shark attack, shark attack!

681
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:20,049
Shark attack!
Booze attack.

682
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:22,184
Booze attack. Booze attack. Oh, yummy,
yummy, yummy. Look at what he brought.

683
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:25,087
Look at what he brought. Here.
Arm-wrestle me. Arm-wrestle me.

684
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:26,288
Come on. Ready?
Here we go.

685
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:28,124
Oh, no!

686
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,462
Got ya.
He's a strong man.

687
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:35,798
Okay.
All right, guys.

688
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:38,334
Who's up? Your turn.
It's all yours, big guy.

689
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:40,069
Your turn, buddy.

690
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:43,606
All right, but I can't
drink much more juice.

691
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:46,308
It gives me the runs.
Oh, God.

692
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:48,577
Well, shit.
I think, then,

693
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:51,447
it's time for you
to have your first beer.

694
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,721
All right, I came
as fast as I could.

695
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,823
Oh! With burritos!

696
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:04,427
Okay!
'Cause I made dinner,

697
00:51:04,428 --> 00:51:07,430
so, not sure why we have that.

698
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:10,399
Yummy, yummy,
yummy, yummy. Yum!

699
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,301
What's that?

700
00:51:12,302 --> 00:51:14,303
Uh, special occasion.

701
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:16,772
Company. Company.

702
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:19,241
About that dinner?

703
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,243
Let me get some plates.

704
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:24,313
Yeah, and we're all going to eat.
You too, Charlie, okay?

705
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:25,848
You like burritos?
Yep.

706
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:27,583
Mmm. Me too.

707
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:29,718
How's that look to you, huh?
Here we go.

708
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:32,388
So you met my mom when you
were stealing her power?

709
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:34,824
Borrowing.
Stealing.

710
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:36,726
Stealing. Yeah.

711
00:51:39,362 --> 00:51:40,763
Who does that?

712
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:43,365
You would've done
the exact same thing.

713
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:45,367
No.
No.

714
00:51:45,368 --> 00:51:47,737
No, you wouldn't have.

715
00:51:50,807 --> 00:51:53,209
So you actually like
living here.

716
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:55,544
Yeah, I do.

717
00:51:55,545 --> 00:51:57,613
I mean, there's this...

718
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:01,117
There's, like, one thing
that's... mm.

719
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,384
What?

720
00:52:02,385 --> 00:52:05,488
Sometimes June makes me
rub her feet.

721
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:08,124
Ew! What?
No, I'm kidding.

722
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:10,393
That only happened, like, twice.

723
00:52:11,561 --> 00:52:14,430
You are a freak.

724
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:16,565
So you got a man?

725
00:52:16,566 --> 00:52:19,235
Whoa. Don't even.

726
00:52:19,236 --> 00:52:21,403
What?

727
00:52:21,404 --> 00:52:24,206
Well, the... the first
question you asked me...

728
00:52:24,207 --> 00:52:27,243
The very first question...

729
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:29,378
Isn't about my work,

730
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:33,182
which I do way too much of,

731
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:36,318
or-or about my hobbies

732
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,254
or my interests or...

733
00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:39,889
No.

734
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:43,859
No, the very first question
you ask me is if I've got a man?

735
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:46,730
So you're single.
Go to hell.

736
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:52,434
I'm going through a, uh,
pretty rough breakup myself.

737
00:52:52,435 --> 00:52:54,470
She dumped me,

738
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:58,841
but I guess you could say
I returned the favor.

739
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:05,447
I'm s... What?
What are you laughing at?

740
00:53:05,448 --> 00:53:06,682
You don't want to know.

741
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:08,617
Okay, now you have to tell me.

742
00:53:08,618 --> 00:53:11,587
You can't judge me.
I make no promises.

743
00:53:11,588 --> 00:53:13,522
I upper-decked her.

744
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:15,357
You what?

745
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:19,395
You know the top part
of the toilet

746
00:53:19,396 --> 00:53:22,198
where there's the lid, and then you
got the clean water up there, right?

747
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,566
Mm-hmm.
So...

748
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:25,901
Yeah, I don't like
where this is going.

749
00:53:25,902 --> 00:53:28,671
Yeah, so I went
number two in there,

750
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:33,276
and then I sealed that bad boy
up like an Egyptian coffin.

751
00:53:36,947 --> 00:53:39,216
How old are you?

752
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:46,488
No.

753
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:48,325
I misread that.
Mm-hmm.

754
00:54:08,378 --> 00:54:11,547
Look at this.

755
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:12,782
Go.

756
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:18,822
Whoa-ho-ho-ho!

757
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:23,793
Brought you a little
movie snack.

758
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,702
You son of a bitch.

759
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:40,676
Ollie put you up to this?

760
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:43,747
I plead the Fifth.
Mm.

761
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:52,422
I'll eat the banana,
but that's it.

762
00:54:55,558 --> 00:54:57,360
You're a good kid.

763
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:07,037
Hello.

764
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:11,640
All right, I would like
a pack of reds,

765
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:14,343
a fifth of gin,

766
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:17,914
and six scratchers, but please
pull every other scratch off.

767
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:29,425
Hello.

768
00:55:29,426 --> 00:55:31,927
Yeah.
June said there was

769
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:35,664
some asshole coming by
to get some stuff for her.

770
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:38,434
Okay. I will take
a pack of reds,

771
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:40,602
a fifth of gin,
and six scratch-offs,

772
00:55:40,603 --> 00:55:42,938
but please pull
every other scratcher.

773
00:55:42,939 --> 00:55:45,641
Hey, how is she, by the way?

774
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:47,844
She's fine.

775
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:51,413
Yeah, she hasn't been
coming in here lately,

776
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:54,683
and she didn't look too good
the last time...

777
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:57,586
You know what? Never mind.
I'm rambling.

778
00:55:57,587 --> 00:56:01,124
Uh, just costs $10, for June.

779
00:56:09,566 --> 00:56:11,633
Tell her I said hi.
Will do.

780
00:56:11,634 --> 00:56:13,403
Good.

781

Aren't you, uh, hungry?

786
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:04,754
No, I guess not.

787
00:57:07,791 --> 00:57:10,593
Huh. Well,
that's a first.

788
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:15,432
Well, there's more for me.

789
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,469
What are those pills for?

790
00:57:28,578 --> 00:57:31,613
My business, Rodney.
I'm serious.

791
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:33,449
So am I.

792
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,685
Mind your business.

793
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:40,088
It's just, uh,

794
00:57:40,089 --> 00:57:42,925
Olivia seemed pretty intent
on getting you to take them.

795
00:57:42,926 --> 00:57:44,793
Now there goes my appetite.

796
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:47,763
And earlier today
at the convenience store...

797
00:57:47,764 --> 00:57:51,767
What'd he tell you? He just
asked if you were okay.

798
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:53,837
What are you hiding?

799
00:57:59,676 --> 00:58:02,145
You know what?

800
00:58:03,746 --> 00:58:05,747
I'm going for a drive.

801
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:08,116
You're not allowed to drive.

802
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:10,786
Then you go for a goddamn drive.
I don't have a car.

803
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:13,857
Take mine.
How sick are you?

804
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:17,926
I'm fine.

805
00:58:17,927 --> 00:58:19,895
Don't lie to me.

806
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:22,731
"Don't lie to me"?

807
00:58:22,732 --> 00:58:24,766
What are you, my father?

808
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:26,736
Huh? What do you care?

809
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:31,273
Because I care about you,
you idiot.

810
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:33,675
Don't talk to me like that,
you son of a bitch.

811
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:36,044
Who the hell do
you think you are?

812
00:58:36,045 --> 00:58:39,081
Look, um,

813
00:58:39,082 --> 00:58:41,116
I'm just worried, that's all.

814
00:58:41,117 --> 00:58:43,519
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

815
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,021
Right, you're worried. Yeah, I
know what you're worried about.

816
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:48,690
You're worried about
losing your free ride.

817
00:58:50,793 --> 00:58:53,997
You know what?
You know what?

818
00:58:55,064 --> 00:58:57,733
This is not working for me.

819
00:58:57,734 --> 00:58:59,801
Uh-uh. I, uh...

820
00:58:59,802 --> 00:59:02,871
I think you have
overstayed your welcome.

821
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:05,774
Pack up your stuff.
Tonight.

822
00:59:05,775 --> 00:59:07,910
I want you to pack up
your stuff and go.

823
00:59:07,911 --> 00:59:10,612
You don't mean that, June.

824
00:59:10,613 --> 00:59:12,214
Oh, don't I?

825
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:14,850
Don't I?

826
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:17,152
You know, I, uh,

827
00:59:17,153 --> 00:59:19,721
I gave you a roof,
I gave you a place to stay,

828
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:22,057
I put food in your stomach,
but that is not enough for you.

829
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:24,726
No, no. You just
have to keep prying,

830
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:27,262
don't you, kid? Huh?

831
00:59:27,263 --> 00:59:29,064
Look, if I want to...

832
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:31,700
if I want to kill myself,

833
00:59:31,701 --> 00:59:33,869
that is my business.

834
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:36,305
June, you're blowing this
way out of proportion!

835
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:38,740
And you get out of here.
Go on. Go on. Get out.

836
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:42,312
Leave. Get out. Yeah? No
wonder you're all alone.

837
00:59:43,846 --> 00:59:46,348
Fuck you. Fuck you.

838
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:48,750
Fuck you. Fuck you.
Stop, stop, please.

839
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:51,286
You're gonna talk shit, huh?
Hey! Hey! Stop!

840
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:53,622
You're gonna talk such shit stuff?
Man up. I'm sorry!

841
00:59:53,623 --> 00:59:56,725
Man up, huh? Pussy! Pussy!
I am not gonna fight you!

842
00:59:56,726 --> 01:00:01,631
June! June! Get the fuck
out of my house! Get out!

843
01:00:07,236 --> 01:00:09,839
And you're gonna die
in this house all Al...

844
01:01:25,148 --> 01:01:27,149
Well, thanks for coming, Rudy.

845
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:29,451
We need someone who could
start right this second.

846
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:32,154
We are clogged with work.

847
01:01:32,155 --> 01:01:34,856
It's actually Rodney.

848
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:37,092
Huh?

849
01:01:37,093 --> 01:01:39,127
Ah, that's right.
I apologize.

850
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:41,397
Well, we've been having
a shitter of a day.

851
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,001
So, do you have
any plumbing experience?

852
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:48,737
We need someone who can lay
a lot of pipe, and quick!

853
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:52,007
Hey! Hey!

854
01:01:52,008 --> 01:01:55,911
This work is no laughing matter.

855
01:01:55,912 --> 01:01:59,014
You'd be amazed at some of
the house calls we get.

856
01:01:59,015 --> 01:02:02,084
The things some kids do
to toilets!

857
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:05,488
You ever heard
of an upper-deck?

858
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:11,426
Excuse me.

859
01:02:11,427 --> 01:02:14,029
Talk to me.

860
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:17,866
Well, just do it!
You'll be saving someone's day,

861
01:02:17,867 --> 01:02:20,802
and frankly, we can use the cash.

862
01:02:20,803 --> 01:02:25,006
You'll be a hero. Little Tommy
will forever salute you.

863
01:02:25,007 --> 01:02:28,443
So, back to you.

864
01:02:28,444 --> 01:02:30,812
You said you guys need the cash?

865
01:02:30,813 --> 01:02:33,815
Yeah, but don't worry.
I'll make sure you get paid.

866
01:02:33,816 --> 01:02:35,517
Really?

867
01:02:35,518 --> 01:02:37,052
Of course.

868
01:02:37,053 --> 01:02:40,021
When a poor person's toilet
gets clogged,

869
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:43,024
they grab a plunger
and fix it themselves.

870
01:02:43,025 --> 01:02:45,861
When a rich person's toilet
gets clogged,

871
01:02:45,862 --> 01:02:48,130
they grab a Valium, Xanax,

872
01:02:48,131 --> 01:02:50,532
Klonopin, Ativan, whatever,

873
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:52,134
and they call us.

874
01:02:52,135 --> 01:02:54,436
They're willing to pay us
hundreds of dollars

875
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:57,874
to fish their shit
out of the toilet.

876
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:04,012
I'm sorry. I thought you were
making a joke about the shit.

877
01:03:04,013 --> 01:03:05,447
Kid, don't curse.

878
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:09,084
If you can't take
this job interview seriously,

879
01:03:09,085 --> 01:03:11,553
you probably don't belong here.

880
01:03:11,554 --> 01:03:14,823
Well, I appreciate
the consideration.

881
01:03:14,824 --> 01:03:18,093
Yeah. You didn't get
the job, idiot.

882
01:03:18,094 --> 01:03:20,796
That's not my résumé.

883
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:24,866
It's not?
Oh, this guy's good though.

884
01:03:26,903 --> 01:03:30,071
Rudy, we are clogged with work.

885
01:03:30,072 --> 01:03:33,008
Okay.

886
01:03:39,415 --> 01:03:42,885
So he just up and left,
just like that?

887
01:03:46,022 --> 01:03:48,223
Just like that.

888
01:03:48,224 --> 01:03:51,259
It was like...
Flash Man.

889
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:55,897
Right, and you're sure
you had nothing to do with it.

890
01:03:55,898 --> 01:03:58,534
Absolutely.
Nothing.

891
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:02,371
Mom.

892
01:04:06,542 --> 01:04:08,476
He was an asshole.

893
01:04:08,477 --> 01:04:10,879
So are you.

894
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,415
Good point.

895
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:15,951
Are you going to apologize?

896
01:04:15,952 --> 01:04:17,986
What for?

897
01:04:17,987 --> 01:04:20,222
And besides, I don't
even know where he is.

898
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:23,124
You call him.
I don't have his number.

899
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:25,627
What? Seriously?

900
01:04:25,628 --> 01:04:27,229
He lived here.

901
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:30,233
Why would I have
a need to call him?

902
01:04:46,582 --> 01:04:49,151
He really didn't have any money.

903
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:59,160
I got this.

904
01:04:59,161 --> 01:05:01,129
Check and mate, mate.

905
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:05,166
I call a re-do. I'm gonna
quit while I'm still on top.

906
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:07,202
Come on!

907
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:08,603
Fine.

908
01:05:08,604 --> 01:05:10,139
Yes!

909
01:05:13,175 --> 01:05:15,144
You all right?

910
01:05:16,345 --> 01:05:18,213
What? I'm fine.

911
01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:20,449
You should go talk to her.

912
01:05:22,118 --> 01:05:23,551
You keep saying that.

913
01:05:23,552 --> 01:05:27,155
Because, duh, it's true.
How about this?

914
01:05:27,156 --> 01:05:29,592
If I win, then you have to.

915
01:05:31,294 --> 01:05:33,995
You've been playing me
this whole time. Yes.

916
01:05:33,996 --> 01:05:38,166
No, I mean, you've been waiting for this
moment, and now you're gonna whoop my ass.

917
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:39,434
Also yes.

918
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:41,303
Well, what if I quit?

919
01:05:41,304 --> 01:05:44,439
Then you'll have lost
because you resigned.

920
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,574
You're going to be
president someday.

921
01:05:46,575 --> 01:05:49,010
Nah, that's for chumps.

922
01:05:49,011 --> 01:05:51,680
Party on the top floor.

923
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:53,615
Slap it, boss.

924
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:56,151
Little slap to make her happy.

925
01:05:56,152 --> 01:05:58,019
What?

926
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:00,289
Weirdo.

927
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:08,630
Hey. Um,

928
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:11,366
so I know this is
kind of awkward,

929
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:13,368
and you probably didn't
expect to see me again

930
01:06:13,369 --> 01:06:18,239
after the whole incident,
but, um,

931
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,442
is there any chance
I could crash,

932
01:06:20,443 --> 01:06:21,977
just for tonight?

933
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:25,113
You are more than welcome
here, buddy.

934
01:06:25,114 --> 01:06:28,184
It's great to see you.
You too.

935
01:06:31,387 --> 01:06:33,321
You too, my man.
Like I said,

936
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:36,624
it'll just be one or two...
One or two or a few.

937
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:38,526
Yeah.
Let's make it...

938
01:06:38,527 --> 01:06:41,062
Wanna call it three or 14?

939
01:06:41,063 --> 01:06:42,664
Just a handshake on five?

940
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:45,200
Can you just promise me,
like, a week?

941
01:06:45,201 --> 01:06:46,334
Five...

942
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:48,671
Do you have pizza?
Well...

943
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:53,509
Fuck it.

944
01:06:59,281 --> 01:07:01,649
Did you take your pills?
Yes.

945
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:03,419
I promise.

946
01:07:05,788 --> 01:07:07,689
How are you feeling?

947
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:09,591
Like shit.

948
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:13,629
I could use a drink.

949
01:07:19,101 --> 01:07:23,339
I'm sorry I haven't been around
as much as I should be.

950
01:07:25,107 --> 01:07:27,776
You work your ass off.

951
01:07:27,777 --> 01:07:29,778
And you love it.

952
01:07:29,779 --> 01:07:33,416
And I love that you love it.

953
01:07:36,352 --> 01:07:39,055
Never say you're sorry.

954
01:07:41,323 --> 01:07:44,359
You take good care of me, hon.

955
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:47,195
Better than anybody
could ever do.

956
01:07:47,196 --> 01:07:50,198
It's not your fault you got a...

957
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:52,802
stubborn old bitch of a mom.

958
01:08:06,115 --> 01:08:08,717
I am so proud of you.

959
01:08:11,554 --> 01:08:15,190
And your dad... oh...

960
01:08:15,191 --> 01:08:18,327
He would have been
real proud of you too.

961
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:25,233
You did good, baby.

962
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:27,503
You did good.

963
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:47,155
Mom? Are you okay?

964
01:08:47,156 --> 01:08:49,557
And your actions

965
01:08:49,558 --> 01:08:52,193
put me in a slightly
more hurtful position.

966
01:08:52,194 --> 01:08:55,698
You're basically the reason
I'm in this entire situation.

967
01:08:58,467 --> 01:09:01,769
Do you know what
your problem is?

968
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:03,204
I'm just lost.

969
01:09:03,205 --> 01:09:06,441
You escalate things.

970
01:09:06,442 --> 01:09:10,278
You need to
un-escalate things.

971
01:09:10,279 --> 01:09:12,413
You need to de-escalate.

972
01:09:12,414 --> 01:09:15,350
You're going up.
You need to go down

973
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:17,519
and un-escalate it

974
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,188
instead of escalate.

975
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:22,391
That's your problem.

976
01:09:24,693 --> 01:09:25,928
Okay.

977
01:09:29,932 --> 01:09:31,467
Excuse me.

978
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:34,302
But I see what you're saying.

979
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:17,446
Hello, people I don't know.

980
01:10:20,516 --> 01:10:22,284
Tough crowd.

981
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:26,721
Is this some sort of a...

982
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:28,824
party, or what are...

983
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:33,695
Either way, I'm gonna guess my invitation
was probably lost in the mail.

984
01:10:33,696 --> 01:10:37,366
And I don't really have a mailbox right
now, you know what I'm sayin'? Hey!

985
01:10:43,305 --> 01:10:45,574
What, did somebody die
or something?

986
01:10:50,012 --> 01:10:53,548
Um, I just personally
wanted to thank all of you

987
01:10:53,549 --> 01:10:55,550
for being here today.

988
01:10:55,551 --> 01:10:59,387
I know you all hold a special
place in my mom's heart.

989
01:10:59,388 --> 01:11:03,025
I'd like to say a few words myself.
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

990
01:11:05,527 --> 01:11:07,029
Mm.

991
01:11:12,301 --> 01:11:14,469
Allow me.

992
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:16,005
Okay.

993
01:11:18,474 --> 01:11:21,376
You've come to fight
as free men,

994
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:24,545
and free men you are.

995
01:11:24,546 --> 01:11:27,683
But what will you do
with that freedom?

996
01:11:29,018 --> 01:11:31,552
Will you run?

997
01:11:31,553 --> 01:11:35,623
Or will you fight?
Is that from Braveheart?

998
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:37,493
June fought.

999
01:11:38,661 --> 01:11:40,461
June was a fighter.

1000
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:43,398
I didn't know her...
that well,

1001
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:45,466
but I knew that much.

1002
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:48,503
She took a chance on me
when no one else wouldn't.

1003
01:11:48,504 --> 01:11:49,772
"Would."
Thank you.

1004
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,940
I guess now's
the part in the speech

1005
01:11:52,941 --> 01:11:56,044
where people say all those
stupid cliché things like,

1006
01:11:56,045 --> 01:11:57,979
"She lived life her way"

1007
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:00,548
or "danced to the beat
of her own drum,"

1008
01:12:00,549 --> 01:12:03,484
but I think
June would hate that.

1009
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:05,421
She would.

1010
01:12:07,356 --> 01:12:11,793
I had the, uh,
worst day of my life.

1011
01:12:11,794 --> 01:12:15,330
Everything that could
go wrong did go wrong,

1012
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:17,031
and then I met June,

1013
01:12:17,032 --> 01:12:20,635
and she rubbed it in my face.

1014
01:12:20,636 --> 01:12:23,805
But then she gave me
a place to stay,

1015
01:12:23,806 --> 01:12:27,442
and she gave me tuna sandwiches,

1016
01:12:27,443 --> 01:12:29,877
and they were fuckin' terrible.

1017
01:12:29,878 --> 01:12:31,947
But she made me, me again.

1018
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:37,418
I, uh, guess that's
all I have to say.

1019
01:12:37,419 --> 01:12:40,054
Shit, fuckin' allergies or...

1020
01:12:42,758 --> 01:12:45,527
Who wants to get laid?

1021
01:12:48,764 --> 01:12:53,534
Wake up! Yo! Hey, wake up!

1022
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:56,003
I decided to have a funeral

1023
01:12:56,004 --> 01:12:58,073
for my old self.

1024
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:02,710
It passed.

1025
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:06,381
And me?
I am headed to Hawaii.

1026
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:08,516
How old are you?

1027
01:13:08,517 --> 01:13:11,619
Oh, I got you good!

1028
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:14,522
You monster.

1029
01:13:14,523 --> 01:13:17,525
Come on, let's get you up.
Come on. Get up!

1030
01:13:17,526 --> 01:13:21,562
Let's help her.
After we get me up.

1031
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:24,532
Ooh! Yeah.
Yep.

1032
01:13:24,533 --> 01:13:26,834
I'm up, I'm up, I'm up.

1033
01:13:26,835 --> 01:13:28,836
All right, well, hey,
I just wanted to let you know,

1034
01:13:28,837 --> 01:13:32,106
all that stuff that I said
over there, I was just joking.

1035
01:13:32,107 --> 01:13:34,575
I didn't mean any of that,
so don't get weird.

1036
01:13:34,576 --> 01:13:38,980
Well, some people grow up,
and others, like you, yeah...

1037
01:13:38,981 --> 01:13:42,517
born a little bitch,
always a little bitch.

1038
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,721
So, Hawaii?
Mm-hmm.

1039
01:13:49,658 --> 01:13:52,059
The ocean air
will be good for her.

1040
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:54,128
Uh,

1041
01:13:54,129 --> 01:13:57,498
speaking of it,
uh, want to give me

1042
01:13:57,499 --> 01:14:00,535
a minute, a little tick
with Rodney?

1043
01:14:00,536 --> 01:14:02,570
Yeah.

1044
01:14:02,571 --> 01:14:04,639
Oh, hey, Rodney?
Yeah?

1045
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:08,444
Thank you for taking care
of her when I couldn't.

1046
01:14:14,716 --> 01:14:17,018
So, listen.

1047
01:14:17,019 --> 01:14:20,688
Against my better judgment

1048
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:23,524
and the advice of my lawyer,

1049
01:14:23,525 --> 01:14:26,661
I decided I wanted to
leave you a little something.

1050
01:14:26,662 --> 01:14:29,698
You shouldn't have.
What is it?

1051
01:14:30,966 --> 01:14:33,235
Now I really know
I shouldn't have.

1052
01:14:35,671 --> 01:14:38,973
Corner convenience store?
I actually own it.

1053
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:40,775
Hmm?

1054
01:14:40,776 --> 01:14:44,546
And I'm leaving it to you.

1055
01:14:45,781 --> 01:14:46,781
What?
Mm-hmm.

1056
01:14:46,782 --> 01:14:49,817
Why would you do that?

1057
01:14:49,818 --> 01:14:52,687
'Cause I don't scare you.

1058
01:14:52,688 --> 01:14:55,223
And, uh, you make me laugh.

1059
01:14:57,559 --> 01:15:00,728
I appreciate the faith.

1060
01:15:00,729 --> 01:15:02,630
I almost forgot.

1061
01:15:02,631 --> 01:15:06,067
Meet me in the garage.

1062
01:15:06,068 --> 01:15:07,902
The garage?

1063
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:10,705
Easy. This is very
scary, Rodney.

1064
01:15:10,706 --> 01:15:12,707
Easy.

1065
01:15:12,708 --> 01:15:14,275
Stop.
Here?

1066
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:16,210
Keep 'em closed.
Okay. All right.

1067
01:15:16,211 --> 01:15:18,112
Don't cheat.
I'm not gonna cheat.

1068
01:15:18,113 --> 01:15:20,748
Could ruin the whole thing if you cheat.
I'm not a cheater.

1069
01:15:20,749 --> 01:15:22,216
All right.

1070
01:15:22,217 --> 01:15:24,685
I'm many things,
but I'm not a cheater.

1071
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:27,121
And... t...

1072
01:15:27,122 --> 01:15:29,624

Rodney, I don't know...

1078
01:15:53,815 --> 01:15:55,784
I don't know what to say.

You know, they say
you never forget.

and I want to wish you farewell.

1104
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:27,074
It was truly
a pleasure knowing you.

1105
01:17:27,075 --> 01:17:29,043
You don't mean any of that.

1106
01:17:29,044 --> 01:17:30,911
No, I do not.

Hey, that's what happens
