[woman] Yeah. Oh, yeah.
There we go.

00:00:07,947 --> 00:00:09,615
No, no, no, let's not...

5
00:00:09,617 --> 00:00:10,851
Take your shirt off, little boy.

Yeah. Shut up! Shut up!

Oh, here, look at the butterfly.
You gotta look at the butterfly.

16
00:00:31,037 --> 00:00:32,703
Now look at the butterfly.
Now look at the butterfly.

17
00:00:32,705 --> 00:00:33,971
Look at the butterfly.
Oh!

Wakey-wakey,
hands off your snakey.

35
00:02:21,081 --> 00:02:22,583
I'm not... Mom, morning.

36
00:02:23,983 --> 00:02:26,854
You're not looking at those
smutty sites, are you?

37
00:02:27,053 --> 00:02:30,588
Like FuckTube and YouTug.

38
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,793
Ugh. No. Why have you even
heard of things like that?

39
00:02:33,059 --> 00:02:35,629
There's a better girl out there for
you, darling. Don't you worry.

40
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,164
I always thought Alison
was a bit of a whore anyway.

41
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,501
Mom!

42
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:42,536
Just a mother's intuition.
Anyway...

43
00:02:43,636 --> 00:02:47,474
I want to tell you that I've
met a lovely American chap.

44
00:02:47,673 --> 00:02:50,477
- What?
- Yes. At the convention in Chicago.

45
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,579
We met in the bar and he bedded
me in his room that night.

46
00:02:54,581 --> 00:02:56,684
- And I'm going to marry him.
- What?

47
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,817
Now, don't get over-excited.

48
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:00,685
I'm not getting over-excited,

49
00:03:00,687 --> 00:03:03,555
I'm just hoping this is a joke
or something.

50
00:03:03,557 --> 00:03:06,027
- A weird joke.
- Honestly.

51
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,528
He's the first man since your father
left to make me feel pleasure.

52
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,497
That's completely unnecessary.

53
00:03:12,499 --> 00:03:13,931
Honestly, I've been
craving a man.

54
00:03:13,933 --> 00:03:15,599
Then please stop
being honest, Mom.

55
00:03:15,601 --> 00:03:17,971
He's a lovely chap,
you're going to really like him.

56
00:03:19,071 --> 00:03:20,171
Is he here?

57
00:03:20,173 --> 00:03:22,039
Oh, no,
you're going to meet him.

58
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,541
What are you on about?

59
00:03:23,543 --> 00:03:25,112
- He's bought you a ticket.
- [spits]

60
00:03:25,779 --> 00:03:27,081
- Where?
- To America.

61
00:03:27,748 --> 00:03:29,080
- Really?
- Yes.

62
00:03:29,082 --> 00:03:31,883
- Where?
- Bismarck, North Dakota.

63
00:03:31,885 --> 00:03:33,451
Oh, where the hell is that?

64
00:03:33,453 --> 00:03:35,687
Well, now,
I've heard it's a lovely place.

65
00:03:35,689 --> 00:03:38,556
They call it
"The Orlando of the North."

66
00:03:38,558 --> 00:03:41,193
Without the Disneyland or the
tropical weather, of course.

67
00:03:41,195 --> 00:03:43,228
- What?
- So, you'll stay there for a while,

68
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,164
I'll be here
and wrap up stuff at work

69
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:50,004
and then join you on the weekend
for our little wedding.

70
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,671
<i>This</i> weekend?

71
00:03:52,773 --> 00:03:54,605
Darling, if you don't like it,
you don't have to move.

72
00:03:54,607 --> 00:03:55,574
Mom, this is...

73
00:03:55,576 --> 00:03:57,545
What's the harm in going
and meeting everyone?

74
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:00,981
I understand American girls
quite like a British accent.

75
00:04:01,648 --> 00:04:02,713
I have something for you.

76
00:04:02,715 --> 00:04:05,584
Oh, my God. Gross.

77
00:04:05,586 --> 00:04:08,189
- Well, now hang on.
- Why are there so many of them as well?

78
00:04:11,658 --> 00:04:12,957
Would you like
to see a photo?

79
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:13,694
No.

80
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,529
Here's my Romeo.

81
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:20,634
- Oh, my good God, Mom.
- His name is Michaelson.

82
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,069
- What? Michael?
- Son.

83
00:04:22,703 --> 00:04:23,871
- Son?
- Michaelson.

84
00:04:24,136 --> 00:04:25,903
Michaelson?
What sort of a name is that?

85
00:04:25,905 --> 00:04:27,838
Oh, don't be silly, darling,
please.

86
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,509
He's got two lovely sons.

87
00:04:29,742 --> 00:04:32,644
Sean, the accountant,
and Joey.

88
00:04:32,646 --> 00:04:34,745
I hear he's a bit
of a character.

89
00:04:34,747 --> 00:04:38,051
- It'll be the start of a new chapter...
- I don't care.

90
00:04:38,251 --> 00:04:40,117
Mom, I want nothing to do
with these people.

91
00:04:40,119 --> 00:04:41,721
I am not going.

- Pardon yourself, assface.

Freak out
and I'm going to homicide you.

How are you doing, eh?
This here's Sean.

All right.
That's how we like it.

so you'll be crashing here
in my dojo down here. Yeah.

And I hope you don't mind
the girls being in here,

137

'cause they love Joe's room.

- Oh, the cats?
- Yeah.

[Elliot] It's not...
It doesn't really matter, but...

143

It's a mild allergy.

Look, I am so sorry.
I am so sorry.

145

Consider this
an official apology, okay?

146

- Okay.
- We had no idea.

My mom actually gave me
allergy medicine, so...

Your mom is an angel sent
directly from God's bosom.

- Directly! Directly!

00:07:32,925 --> 00:07:35,360
I'm telling ya, if you're
thinking I'm some kind of weirdo,

159
00:07:35,362 --> 00:07:37,932
I'm a...
I'm actually pretty cool.

160
00:07:38,264 --> 00:07:40,066
- I'm pretty cool. [clears throat]
- Mmm-hmm.

161
00:07:41,167 --> 00:07:42,834
[cat growls]

162
00:07:42,836 --> 00:07:43,804
I think I'm...

163
00:07:44,804 --> 00:07:45,903
I think I'm pretty nervous.

164
00:07:45,905 --> 00:07:46,870
Is the cat okay?

165
00:07:46,872 --> 00:07:48,173
- Yeah.
- Okay.

166
00:07:48,175 --> 00:07:49,110
Yeah, I think he went to the bathroom.
I gotta go.

167
00:07:54,146 --> 00:07:55,315
Really beautiful house.

168
00:07:55,881 --> 00:07:57,684
Oh, yeah, did my dad
set you up okay?

169
00:07:59,186 --> 00:08:01,920
Yes. I'm in the sort of Asian-inspired
room. I've got my own punch bag and...

170
00:08:01,922 --> 00:08:03,023
- Right. The dojo.
- Yeah.

171
00:08:03,223 --> 00:08:04,822
Sorry about the cats.
Um...

172
00:08:04,824 --> 00:08:07,225
Ever since our mom died,
my dad's been really into them.

173
00:08:07,227 --> 00:08:08,062
- [meows]
- Oh.

174
00:08:08,828 --> 00:08:09,761
Sometimes he just tries
too hard.

175
00:08:09,763 --> 00:08:12,062
I just think he really wants you
to like him.

176
00:08:12,064 --> 00:08:13,333
So, what's up, are you in
a costume or some shit?

177
00:08:14,367 --> 00:08:16,468
- [Sean] Dude...
- I'm just saying.

178
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,772
We need to make him look less like
Doctor Who before the trip. That's all.

179
00:08:19,073 --> 00:08:21,305
I just... I wasn't really sure
what was appropriate to wear in...

180
00:08:21,307 --> 00:08:23,307
I can dress you in my threads if
you're cool with the smell of pussy,

181
00:08:23,309 --> 00:08:24,377
because they be covered
in that shit, yo.

182
00:08:26,345 --> 00:08:27,148
He's a moron.

183
00:08:28,982 --> 00:08:30,115
So, you just graduated college?

184
00:08:30,117 --> 00:08:31,415
Yeah, a couple of weeks ago.

185
00:08:31,417 --> 00:08:32,686
Oh, cool,
did you go to Hogwarts?

186
00:08:34,286 --> 00:08:35,122
You see...

187
00:08:35,921 --> 00:08:36,956
Total moron.

188
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:38,725
Okay.

189
00:08:39,859 --> 00:08:42,192
[Michaelson] All right.
You dudes better be hungry.

190
00:08:42,194 --> 00:08:43,995
- [cat yowls]
- Get out of here.

191
00:08:43,997 --> 00:08:45,996
Ah. Yeah.

192
00:08:45,998 --> 00:08:48,201
[chuckles] Oh, wait, pizza's here.
All right!

193
00:08:48,901 --> 00:08:51,771
Hey, El,
they got pizza in the UK?

194
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:54,775
- Uh, yup.
- Cool.

195
00:08:55,074 --> 00:08:57,310
- Awesome. [clears throat]
- Hi, guys.

196
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,110
[Joey] Hey!

197
00:08:59,112 --> 00:09:01,846
- Hey!
- Hey, all right!

198
00:09:01,848 --> 00:09:02,849
- [Michaelson] Okay.
- [Sean] Yay.

199
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,416
- Hi, I'm Skylar.
- Hi. Elliot.

200
00:09:05,418 --> 00:09:07,254
Oh. Nice to meet you.

201
00:09:08,221 --> 00:09:10,491
This must be so crazy for you,
coming out here to meet these guys.

202
00:09:11,091 --> 00:09:12,791
Uh... Yeah, a bit.

203
00:09:12,793 --> 00:09:13,761
[Skylar chuckles]

204
00:09:14,394 --> 00:09:15,328
[Michaelson] Yeah,
that looks good.

205
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,064
After you.

206
00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:20,300
Oh. Thanks.

207
00:09:21,867 --> 00:09:23,400
[Michaelson] Oh,
wait, wait, wait!

208
00:09:23,402 --> 00:09:24,838
I got something for you, El.

209
00:09:25,838 --> 00:09:27,907
- A little English food, huh?
- Oh.

210
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:29,477
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh.

211
00:09:32,145 --> 00:09:33,948
[Michaelson, English accent]
Your tea and crumpets, sir.

212
00:09:35,147 --> 00:09:37,517
- Thanks.
- [American accent] Yes, of course. My pleasure.

213
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,252
- Looks great.
- Like you never left home, right?

214
00:09:42,088 --> 00:09:43,488
Are you guys excited
for the road trip?

215
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,023
Fuck, yeah!
Fucking road trip, baby.

216
00:09:45,025 --> 00:09:46,557
Hey, are Amy and Shu driving
with you?

217
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,525
Yeah, and some girl from work
wants to come.

218
00:09:48,527 --> 00:09:49,763
Oh, yeah,
I bet she wants to come.

219
00:09:51,397 --> 00:09:53,030
Atta boy, Joey.

220
00:09:53,032 --> 00:09:54,465
[all laughing]

221
00:09:54,467 --> 00:09:57,000
- Joey! Right?
- Whoo, whoo, whoo.

222
00:09:57,002 --> 00:10:00,206
[sniffing]
Sniff it. Yeah. Yeah.

223
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,975
That's my boy.

224
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:06,076
So... Sorry, what is it
that we're doing, exactly?

225
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:08,245
Oh, it's alumni weekend at
our college in Colorado.

226
00:10:08,247 --> 00:10:10,148
Yeah, my frat is throwing
a fucking rager.

227
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:14,085
Yeah. Listen, after dinner, why
don't you guys pop a few brewskis,

228
00:10:14,087 --> 00:10:17,258
fill El in on the road trip, and
then I'm gonna hit the dojo.

229
00:10:19,192 --> 00:10:21,262
Right after this, I'm gonna
give Sean a little ass-pounding

230
00:10:21,527 --> 00:10:23,062
in a game called
"Ass-pounding."

231
00:10:24,064 --> 00:10:24,998
You guys got that in the UK?

232
00:10:26,065 --> 00:10:27,066
- No.
- [Sean] You're gonna...

233
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,334
You're gonna pound me
in the ass?

234
00:10:29,902 --> 00:10:30,802
[Joey] The fuck you trying
to say?

235
00:10:30,804 --> 00:10:32,202
You just said you were gonna
pound my ass.

236
00:10:32,204 --> 00:10:33,840
That's your new family.

237
00:10:34,074 --> 00:10:35,639
- [Joey] Don't even think about it.
- [Sean] I'm not gay.

238
00:10:35,641 --> 00:10:37,341
[Joey] Pound, pound, pound,
pound, pound, pound, pound...

239
00:10:37,343 --> 00:10:38,845
- [TV: video game sounds]
- [Sean] Oh.

240
00:10:39,346 --> 00:10:40,280
Pound, pound, pound,
pound, pound!

241
00:10:42,147 --> 00:10:44,249
So, I thought you and Sean were,
like, boyfriend and girlfriend.

242
00:10:44,251 --> 00:10:46,187
- Gross, no.
- You're gross.

243
00:10:46,585 --> 00:10:47,587
I just grew up next door.

244
00:10:48,255 --> 00:10:49,888
They're like my brothers.

245
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,356
But you all ended up going
to the same university?

246
00:10:52,358 --> 00:10:54,994
Yeah, we wanted to get away from Bismarck.
Shocker, huh?

247
00:10:55,227 --> 00:10:58,897
Joey had Van Wilder complex, so we
all graduated about the same time.

248
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:00,367
- [Joey] I can hear you.
- You know it's true.

249
00:11:01,901 --> 00:11:03,167
Sean hates his job

250
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:05,606
and Joey's just living at home,
doing this.

251
00:11:06,673 --> 00:11:08,940
All he ever talks about
is the fraternity still.

252
00:11:08,942 --> 00:11:10,240
This trip's gonna be
good for them.

253
00:11:10,242 --> 00:11:12,879
Well, I think life after uni
can be a bit tough.

254
00:11:13,146 --> 00:11:14,582
- You know?
- Oh, yeah?

255
00:11:15,281 --> 00:11:16,547
Well, maybe this will be good
for you, too.

256
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:18,383
Oh.

257
00:11:18,385 --> 00:11:20,384
What's up, sluts? [chuckles] Just kidding.
It's a thing...

258
00:11:20,386 --> 00:11:23,587
- [Joey] Fridge!
- [whispering] Okay, so this is Daniel.

259
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:26,124
They call him "Fridge"
because he's big

260
00:11:26,126 --> 00:11:28,293
or eats out of a fridge a lot
or something? I don't know.

261
00:11:28,295 --> 00:11:30,064
- Okay.
- Who's this guy?

262
00:11:30,597 --> 00:11:33,199
Uh... Fridge, Elliot.
Elliot, Fridge.

263
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:34,400
Hello.

264
00:11:35,367 --> 00:11:36,337
I work for the US government.

265
00:11:40,372 --> 00:11:41,507
- Right.
- What do you do?

266
00:11:42,574 --> 00:11:48,046
Um... I'm kind of in-between...
jobs at the moment.

267
00:11:48,048 --> 00:11:49,980
- Yeah, "funemployed."
- Yeah.

268
00:11:49,982 --> 00:11:51,515
You don't work for the
US government, Fridge.

269
00:11:51,517 --> 00:11:52,585
You're a meter maid.

270
00:11:53,085 --> 00:11:56,089
Parking enforcement officer,
okay?

271
00:11:57,156 --> 00:11:58,722
Still working for
the government, Sean.

272
00:11:58,724 --> 00:11:59,990
Shut up, Fridge.

273
00:11:59,992 --> 00:12:01,127
You got it, bro.

274
00:12:02,628 --> 00:12:03,997
Do you want another beer?

275
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,999
Yeah, but I'll get us one.
All right.

276
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,166
[cat yowls]

277
00:12:08,168 --> 00:12:10,304
- Oh, my God, are you okay?
- Yup, just another cat.

278
00:12:12,572 --> 00:12:13,407
It was a cat.

279
00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:18,612
[panting]

280
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:21,314
[screams]

281
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,982
- [Joey] Morning, Dad.
- Whoo! New record.

282
00:12:24,684 --> 00:12:25,519
[yells]

283
00:12:26,251 --> 00:12:27,655
Road trip, motherfucker!

284
00:12:30,223 --> 00:12:32,525
I'm really not feeling very comfortable
in the clothing Joey's given me.

285
00:12:32,758 --> 00:12:34,427
I don't know, let me see. Spin.

286
00:12:35,627 --> 00:12:38,395
I see what you mean.
It's a little straightforward.

287
00:12:38,397 --> 00:12:41,034
I mean, I didn't go to their college,
but I sure do like to have fun.

288
00:12:41,434 --> 00:12:44,369
Like, on weekends, I'll wear a
shirt with a more humorous slogan,

289
00:12:44,371 --> 00:12:47,304
like, "I'm not as think
as you drunk I am." [laughs]

290
00:12:47,306 --> 00:12:49,173
Oh, yes, very clever.

291
00:12:49,175 --> 00:12:51,210
Shut up, Fridge. It's a wonder
why he never gets laid.

292
00:12:51,611 --> 00:12:52,710
Morning, yo!

293
00:12:52,712 --> 00:12:54,644
Oh, hi.
I can carry that for you.

294
00:12:54,646 --> 00:12:55,982
Oh, no, you don't have to.

295
00:12:56,449 --> 00:12:58,115
Not a fan of the po-pos, huh?

296
00:12:58,117 --> 00:13:00,083
No, I would never usually
wear something like this.

297
00:13:00,085 --> 00:13:01,753
- Hey, when's the evil witch arriving?
- Stop!

298
00:13:01,755 --> 00:13:03,691
- She's coming now.
- [car honks]

299
00:13:04,089 --> 00:13:05,325
Hey!

300
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:08,127
[woman #2]
Let me out of this bento box.

301
00:13:10,396 --> 00:13:12,062
Road trip, bitches!

302
00:13:12,064 --> 00:13:13,199
- Fuck, yeah, bitches!
- Oh.

303
00:13:14,501 --> 00:13:17,034
So, Elliot,
this is Shu and that's Amy.

304
00:13:17,036 --> 00:13:18,369
We all went to college together.

305
00:13:18,371 --> 00:13:20,307
Oh. Hello, nice to meet you.
Elliot.

306
00:13:20,573 --> 00:13:21,307
[Shu, imitating E.T.]
Elliot!

307
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,143
<i>E.T.,</i> that's a great film.

308
00:13:25,145 --> 00:13:26,510
He sounds weird.

309
00:13:26,512 --> 00:13:27,480
- [Elliot] Sorry.
- Hello, ladies.

310
00:13:29,314 --> 00:13:31,081
Let's get out of here
and ditch these losers.

311
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,182
Okay.

312
00:13:32,184 --> 00:13:33,484
My friend will be here
in a minute.

313
00:13:33,486 --> 00:13:35,119
That's right, you got a
hot teacher chick coming.

314
00:13:35,121 --> 00:13:35,655
[Amy] Who is she?

315
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,455
She's the gym instructor
at my school.

316
00:13:37,457 --> 00:13:39,490
She's going through
a really bad breakup,

317
00:13:39,492 --> 00:13:41,525
so I thought she'd appreciate
some time away.

318
00:13:41,527 --> 00:13:42,762
She'll appreciate my crane.

319
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:45,163
[Sean] Come on, dude, no.

320
00:13:45,165 --> 00:13:47,264
She's got
a really cool personality.

321
00:13:47,266 --> 00:13:47,999
[all groan]

322
00:13:48,001 --> 00:13:49,299
[Joey]
Yeah, that's code for pig.

323
00:13:49,301 --> 00:13:50,536
Guys, stop.
That's her right now.

324
00:13:57,276 --> 00:13:58,145
God fucking damn it!

325
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,578
- [Skylar] Hi, friend!
- Oh, keep your distance.

326
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,081
- Oh.
- Breakfast burrito's resting uneasy in my gut.

327
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,118
Are you okay?

328
00:14:05,484 --> 00:14:06,285
We'll know in an hour,
won't we?

329
00:14:06,618 --> 00:14:07,618
What the fuck?

330
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,155
This is Shu and Amy...

331
00:14:09,421 --> 00:14:10,822
- Hey.
- Hey.

332
00:14:10,824 --> 00:14:12,159
- ...and these are the guys.
- Hi, I'm Sean.

333
00:14:13,293 --> 00:14:14,028
Young Joseph.

334
00:14:14,626 --> 00:14:15,328
Fatima.

335
00:14:16,195 --> 00:14:17,064
[whispers]

336
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:18,596
- Who?
- Huh?

337
00:14:18,598 --> 00:14:19,732
- What's your name?
- Fatima.

338
00:14:22,669 --> 00:14:24,304
I'm Daniel.
[chuckles nervously]

339
00:14:24,636 --> 00:14:27,337
But people call me Fridge,
'cause I'm strong or something.

340
00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:28,405
It's whatever,
it's weird.

341
00:14:28,407 --> 00:14:29,609
- Cool name.
- Yeah?

342
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,412
How do you do?
Elliot.

343
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:34,581
- Brit, huh?
- Yup.

344
00:14:35,548 --> 00:14:37,051
- I bet you are.
- Okay.

345
00:14:37,449 --> 00:14:39,085
Um, we're gonna head out.

346
00:14:40,285 --> 00:14:42,289
I'm driving
and Skylar's shotgun.

347
00:14:42,755 --> 00:14:44,621
- [Skylar] See you guys on the road.
- [Sean] Bye.

348
00:14:44,623 --> 00:14:46,691
- [Fridge] See ya. Bye.
- El, I wanna talk to you for a second.

349
00:14:46,693 --> 00:14:50,227
Hey, listen, I really appreciate you being
so cool about everything, you know?

350
00:14:50,229 --> 00:14:53,399
And I really love your mom and I know
we're gonna be a really happy family.

351
00:14:53,665 --> 00:14:55,501
- Okay.
- That being said,

352
00:14:56,301 --> 00:14:59,169
go out there and get
some American ass!

353
00:14:59,171 --> 00:15:00,238
[all laughing]

354
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,442
Be safe, huh?

355
00:15:01,774 --> 00:15:03,710
Don't be late
to my motherfucking wedding.

356
00:15:04,176 --> 00:15:05,743
Yeah, don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

357
00:15:05,745 --> 00:15:07,548
Road trip, bitches!

358
00:15:08,348 --> 00:15:12,582
Drugs and sex and fucking, sucking...
[screams]

359
00:15:12,584 --> 00:15:14,487
Road trip it, motherfucker!

360
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,423
Oh, yeah. Whoo.
They're gone.

361
00:15:18,424 --> 00:15:20,227
Got my run in, my shake.

362
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,393
Jerk off.

363
00:15:22,395 --> 00:15:24,530
[rock song playing]

364
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:27,434
[man singing]

365
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,376
[song ends]

366
00:15:37,477 --> 00:15:39,612
[Joey] Dude, did you hear
what that girl's name was?

367
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:40,780
- Yeah.
- [laughing]

368
00:15:41,381 --> 00:15:42,647
Yo, El, did you hear?

369
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:43,813
Yeah, I heard.

370
00:15:43,815 --> 00:15:44,750
No, but did you
actually hear it?

371
00:15:45,517 --> 00:15:46,819
Yeah, I heard it.

372
00:15:47,386 --> 00:15:49,787
No, you don't get it.
It's "Fat-ima."

373
00:15:49,789 --> 00:15:52,590
She's fat and her name is...
[laughing]

374
00:15:52,592 --> 00:15:54,294
Fatima. I know. I got it.

375
00:15:54,493 --> 00:15:56,594
No, I don't think you pronounce
it like that, okay, guys?

376
00:15:56,596 --> 00:15:58,596
I think it's "Fa-tima."

377
00:15:58,598 --> 00:16:00,197
You know,
it's like a beautiful song.

378
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:02,802
No way! It's "Fat-ima,"
but she's actually fat!

379
00:16:03,335 --> 00:16:04,170
You don't get it.

380
00:16:04,503 --> 00:16:05,735
No, I got it.

381
00:16:05,737 --> 00:16:07,273
- We got it.
- I fucking got it.

382
00:16:07,473 --> 00:16:08,572
Oh, you don't get it.

383
00:16:08,574 --> 00:16:09,709
- Yeah, we get it.
- We get it.

384
00:16:15,548 --> 00:16:18,381
[Amy] We are taking a different
route to those idiots, right?

385
00:16:18,383 --> 00:16:19,817
There's really only one route.

386
00:16:19,819 --> 00:16:21,188
And they're great guys,
anyway.

387
00:16:22,588 --> 00:16:24,889
That English dude
seems kind of cute.

388
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:26,626
Oh, yeah?
I guess he is kind of cute.

389
00:16:29,395 --> 00:16:30,297
A Brit fingered me once.

390
00:16:31,863 --> 00:16:32,732
No complaints.

391
00:16:36,301 --> 00:16:38,769
[Joey] All right, we gotta swing
by Kush's yard and get rigged up.

392
00:16:38,771 --> 00:16:39,772
[Fridge] Yeah.

393
00:16:40,707 --> 00:16:42,309
- Wait, what does that mean?
- Marijuana.

394
00:16:43,376 --> 00:16:44,475
Oh.

395
00:16:44,477 --> 00:16:46,244
I don't think
we have time, guys.

396
00:16:46,246 --> 00:16:48,479
We should just keep driving.
Just keep on driving.

397
00:16:48,481 --> 00:16:50,480
- No, this party's gonna be a rager.
- Yeah. Honk, honk!

398
00:16:50,482 --> 00:16:51,919
We gotta do shit right.

399
00:16:52,751 --> 00:16:54,784
I'm not showing up
empty-handed.

400
00:16:54,786 --> 00:16:57,455
Yeah, look, I... I don't wanna be the
sort of party pooper or whatever.

401
00:16:57,457 --> 00:16:59,322
I'm not really comfortable
with the whole drugs thing,

402
00:16:59,324 --> 00:17:00,423
you know,
it's not really my thing.

403
00:17:00,425 --> 00:17:01,926
I've just applied
for a job and...

404
00:17:01,928 --> 00:17:04,628
No, fuck that! We're gonna rage
like true frat stars, all right?

405
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,963
We're gonna get you some Smir
to get things started,

406
00:17:06,965 --> 00:17:08,899
some brewskis to keep the form,
a little... [sniffs]

407
00:17:08,901 --> 00:17:11,672
bombers to keep things going,
fucking...

408
00:17:12,504 --> 00:17:14,271
You know,
and do shots to black out

409
00:17:14,273 --> 00:17:16,274
and do whatever the fuck you do
when you're blacked out.

410
00:17:16,276 --> 00:17:19,309
And then... you know,
smoke a doob to level out

411
00:17:19,311 --> 00:17:21,412
and then snort a ripper in the
morning to get back on track.

412
00:17:21,414 --> 00:17:22,480
[Joey, Fridge laughing]

413
00:17:22,482 --> 00:17:24,318
- You know what I'm saying?
- Good time!

414
00:17:25,917 --> 00:17:27,753
I have no idea
what you just said.

415
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:35,229
You guys remember Steve Collins?

416
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,830
Oh. Skeazy Steve.

417
00:17:38,397 --> 00:17:40,298
Don't even go there.

418
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:44,535
That's right! You and Skeazy Steve
had a skeazy sesh together.

419
00:17:44,537 --> 00:17:46,703
- Oh!
- It was freshman year.

420
00:17:46,705 --> 00:17:49,842
It was so long ago,
I can pretend it never happened.

421
00:17:50,376 --> 00:17:51,575
But it did happen.

422
00:17:51,577 --> 00:17:53,880
Oh, it definitely happened.

423
00:17:55,348 --> 00:17:57,483
So, what are we talking about, here?
Intercourse?

424
00:17:57,716 --> 00:18:00,853
No. Just a good old
college beej.

425
00:18:01,587 --> 00:18:04,657
- Ew! She had Skeazy Steve's wiener in her mouth.
- Ugh!

426
00:18:04,857 --> 00:18:07,261
[imitates gagging] Oh!

427
00:18:08,594 --> 00:18:10,461
I love giving blowjobs.

428
00:18:10,463 --> 00:18:12,596
No, you don't.
No girl actually likes it.

429
00:18:12,598 --> 00:18:13,867
No girl likes blowjobs.

430
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:15,535
I do.

431
00:18:17,502 --> 00:18:19,670
You know what it is? Guys watch
too much porn these days.

432
00:18:19,672 --> 00:18:21,638
- Yes.
- Yeah, we're not porn stars.

433
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,007
We're not!

434
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:25,511
Skeazy Steve tried to
jizz on my face.

435
00:18:25,744 --> 00:18:27,010
- Stop.
- Yeah.

436
00:18:27,012 --> 00:18:29,849
- As if girls actually want that.
- Ew...

437
00:18:30,383 --> 00:18:32,052
- You didn't let him, did you?
- God...

438
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:38,055
[siren wailing in distance]

439
00:18:38,057 --> 00:18:39,358
[man] Fuck you, man!

440
00:18:40,092 --> 00:18:41,894
[woman screams]

441
00:18:44,597 --> 00:18:45,699
Is this area safe?

442
00:18:45,932 --> 00:18:47,601
Fuck yeah. This is my hood, yo.

443
00:18:47,966 --> 00:18:50,303
This isn't actually
your hood, yo.

444
00:18:50,603 --> 00:18:53,073
We'd be back where we came from, right?
With Dad.

445
00:18:53,473 --> 00:18:54,473
[gunfire]

446
00:18:57,809 --> 00:19:00,611
It says right here that seven
people were murdered last week.

447
00:19:00,613 --> 00:19:01,578
Right on this spot.

448
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,146
- What?
- Isn't that crazy?

449
00:19:03,148 --> 00:19:06,386
- Yeah.
- Do you guys have smartphones in the UK?

450
00:19:07,052 --> 00:19:09,586
- Yeah.
- No, I mean like smartphones like this.

451
00:19:09,588 --> 00:19:12,455
Not like... [imitates beeping]
"Operator, can I get me mum?"

452
00:19:12,457 --> 00:19:14,024
[laughs]

453
00:19:14,026 --> 00:19:16,563
- But like this.
- Yeah, yeah, no, we've got smartphones.

454
00:19:16,762 --> 00:19:17,496
I don't think so.

455
00:19:17,797 --> 00:19:19,066
Yo, this is the spot.

456
00:19:20,066 --> 00:19:21,768
- [Elliot] Oh, my God.
- [Joey] Yeah.

457
00:19:27,139 --> 00:19:28,809
Kushy's got the best weed
in the world.

458
00:19:32,145 --> 00:19:33,847
[knocking continues]

459
00:19:36,482 --> 00:19:38,749
All right, well, I guess he's
out for tea or something.

460
00:19:38,751 --> 00:19:40,017
So, we should probably just go.

461
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:41,887
- Bhagwan.
- Oh, Kush-dog!

462
00:19:42,655 --> 00:19:46,123
[Jamaican accent] Kush be waiting
for the vermin exterminator.

463
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:49,363
Ah, we...
We came to get some weed.

464
00:19:49,761 --> 00:19:51,932
- Me brethren come to me house for trees?
- Yeah.

465
00:19:52,831 --> 00:19:54,367
[Kush chuckles]

466

that you have here.

Nothing to worry about.

Yo, he's cool.
He's just paranoid.

483
00:20:54,926 --> 00:20:56,562
He's just smoked way too
much weed for a human.

484
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:57,931
Way too much.

485
00:21:01,032 --> 00:21:03,133
Yeah, so, we'd love to
grab an eighth,

486
00:21:03,135 --> 00:21:04,971
and then we'll just
get out of your hair.

This weed be called...
"the Damp Hamster."

488
00:21:15,146 --> 00:21:18,749
Right. Well, Joey, would you
like to pay the gentleman

489
00:21:18,751 --> 00:21:20,183
and we'll just take the damp
hamster somewhere else?

I smoke with the brother.

491

Uh... I don't think...

492
00:21:24,757 --> 00:21:26,022
- Do we need to smoke?
- [Sean] No, we don't need to do that.

493
00:21:26,024 --> 00:21:27,892
- We don't need to smoke right now.

Your heart feel like it explode, your
head feel like it be in the tumble dryer,

it being eaten by a cow,

it being entered. [hisses]

And then you crash hard.

00:21:49,714 --> 00:21:51,548
I have to say,

502
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:55,152
I'm not particularly in the mood for
any of those sensations right now.

You know?

we buy it from that lunatic?

00:28:22,441 --> 00:28:23,742
You guys reek of weed.

624
00:28:24,342 --> 00:28:27,576
Yeah, my idiot brother nearly got us
killed by a deranged drug dealer.

625
00:28:27,578 --> 00:28:28,513
It was so dope.

626
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,080
Ladies, your food will be
right out.

627
00:28:31,082 --> 00:28:32,217
Thanks, Saul.

628
00:28:33,484 --> 00:28:36,356
Hey, <i>monsieur,</i> could I get
a bowl of cereal, please?

629
00:28:36,989 --> 00:28:40,026
Yes, I will also like
a bowl of cereal, <i>monsieur.</i>

630
00:28:40,591 --> 00:28:42,625
Actually, that sounds really good.
I'll do the same, please, thank you.

631
00:28:42,627 --> 00:28:45,330
Oh, make that six.
And a steak.

632
00:28:46,197 --> 00:28:47,663
How high are you morons?

633
00:28:47,665 --> 00:28:49,066
Quite uncomfortably high.

634
00:28:49,068 --> 00:28:50,636
[lisping]
Six cereal and a steak.

635
00:28:51,069 --> 00:28:53,172
Just give me a shout
if you need anything else.

636
00:28:53,504 --> 00:28:56,105
[mock lisp] Okay, yeah,
can I have six more sodas

637
00:28:56,107 --> 00:28:58,477
with some sesame seeds
and some sweet and sour sauce

638
00:28:58,711 --> 00:28:59,646
on my sausage?

639
00:29:02,548 --> 00:29:05,117
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

640
00:29:05,584 --> 00:29:08,354
- Seriously?
- Yes. Seriously.

641
00:29:09,521 --> 00:29:10,322
Seriously?

642
00:29:12,491 --> 00:29:13,225
Seriously.

643
00:29:15,094 --> 00:29:17,330
- [Joey snickers]
- Joey!

644
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:18,932
[normal voice]
Did you see what I did?

645
00:29:20,432 --> 00:29:21,467
You see what I did?

646
00:29:22,467 --> 00:29:24,036
No, I missed it.
It must have been really subtle.

647
00:29:26,004 --> 00:29:28,140
- Don't judge all of America on Joey.
- Okay.

648
00:29:30,509 --> 00:29:34,113
Okay, well, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to, uh, go the toilet.

649
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,113
[Amy] Don't you mean the loo?

650
00:29:36,115 --> 00:29:39,018
Oh, yes. I'm going to the loo
to do a number two.

651
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,218
[all] Ew!

652
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,685
Yeah, I'm not. No. I didn't...
I didn't mean that.

653
00:29:42,687 --> 00:29:45,321
I meant... one is all I need.

654
00:29:45,323 --> 00:29:47,359
- I'm really high, so...
- Okay, bye.

655
00:29:48,394 --> 00:29:50,660
[laughs]
He likes you!

656
00:29:50,662 --> 00:29:51,965
Stop. Stop it.

657
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,066
- [Saul] Oops.
- [girls] Oh!

658
00:29:56,068 --> 00:29:57,299
Sorry.

659
00:29:57,301 --> 00:29:58,634
[all laughing]

660
00:29:58,636 --> 00:30:01,203
- It's not funny.
- [Amy] It's what you get!

661
00:30:01,205 --> 00:30:02,175
It's bad service.

662
00:30:07,146 --> 00:30:08,013
[Elliot]
Oh, my God.

663
00:30:08,813 --> 00:30:10,446
[Skylar laughs]

664
00:30:10,448 --> 00:30:12,315
Seriously,
I'm not wearing this anymore.

665
00:30:12,317 --> 00:30:13,553
It really does
suit you though.

666
00:30:14,787 --> 00:30:15,722
I got some less gangster shit
if you're not feeling that.

667
00:30:16,489 --> 00:30:17,721
Surprisingly,
I'm not feeling it,

668
00:30:17,723 --> 00:30:21,194
considering it only says "Fuck
the police" in giant letters.

669
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,093
So, where are you guys
staying tonight?

670
00:30:23,095 --> 00:30:24,528
Oh, we haven't thought
that far ahead.

671
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:26,462
Maybe we should stay
where you guys are staying.

672
00:30:26,464 --> 00:30:28,201
Fuck that!
These bitches made bank.

673
00:30:28,434 --> 00:30:30,232
I live foot-to-mouth, my dog.
I don't do that.

674
00:30:30,234 --> 00:30:31,503
I'm pretty sure it's
"hand-to-mouth."

675
00:30:32,437 --> 00:30:33,737
And what is that?

676
00:30:33,739 --> 00:30:37,242
And I'm sure us bitches
got the last room.

677
00:30:38,376 --> 00:30:39,776
Is that a cat in your car?

678
00:30:39,778 --> 00:30:40,646
Yup.

679
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,781
[Skylar] Okay, I think we're
gonna head out.

680
00:30:43,281 --> 00:30:44,247
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

681
00:30:44,249 --> 00:30:44,784
- Oh.
- Oh.

682
00:30:51,456 --> 00:30:53,323
[Shu laughing]
Oh!

683
00:30:53,325 --> 00:30:56,062
- What the F was that?
- Shut up. Please shut up. Go away. Go away.

684
00:30:58,262 --> 00:31:01,298
Oh, guys, I'm gonna text you
an address for tomorrow,

685
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,202
so meet us there at noon,
all right?

686
00:31:04,103 --> 00:31:06,236
It's a surprise,
like your hug. [laughs]

687
00:31:06,238 --> 00:31:07,206
Shotgun.

688
00:31:07,572 --> 00:31:09,608
- Shotgun.
- Oh, he's learning.

689
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,520
Yo, El, please stop being
a baby dick around Sky.

690
00:31:21,653 --> 00:31:22,789
What is he on about?

691
00:31:23,222 --> 00:31:24,089
[Sean] Well, you do
kind of like her.

692
00:31:25,156 --> 00:31:26,059
Yeah.

693
00:31:26,524 --> 00:31:27,423
You wanna bang her, right?

694
00:31:27,425 --> 00:31:29,659
Well, no, I like her, so...

695
00:31:29,661 --> 00:31:31,560
You just tried to give her some sort
of Special Ed hug back there. Uh-uh.

696
00:31:31,562 --> 00:31:33,596
No. No, it was a hug goodbye.

697
00:31:33,598 --> 00:31:35,068
Just a friendly hug goodbye.

698
00:31:35,334 --> 00:31:36,536
You know what you should
have done?

699
00:31:37,736 --> 00:31:38,769
You should have ignored her
at lunch, hit on her friends,

700
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:40,673
and then bitched her out
when we were leaving.

701
00:31:40,873 --> 00:31:42,506
Guarantee you,
she would have blown you.

702
00:31:42,508 --> 00:31:45,342
- Great. In the parking lot.
- In the parking lot.

703
00:31:45,344 --> 00:31:47,477
- If she would have done that, I would've...
- Shut up, Fridge.

704
00:31:47,479 --> 00:31:50,646
Seriously, the worse you treat
them, the more they want you.

705
00:31:50,648 --> 00:31:51,684
It's the golden rule.

706
00:31:52,818 --> 00:31:55,221
[Sean] American girls are, like,
attracted to douchebags.

707
00:31:55,753 --> 00:31:58,623
Trust me, bro.
I know what I'm talking about.

708
00:31:58,857 --> 00:31:59,591
I really do.

709
00:32:00,358 --> 00:32:02,459
[all groaning]

710
00:32:02,461 --> 00:32:03,492
[Joey] What are you doing?

711
00:32:03,494 --> 00:32:04,928
No warning, nothing. Just...

712
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:07,530
Okay. I had that cereal
with the chunky milk

713
00:32:07,532 --> 00:32:08,765
and then more of the creamer.

714
00:32:08,767 --> 00:32:09,434
- You did have...
- [yelps]

715
00:32:10,601 --> 00:32:12,204
What the hell is going on?

716
00:32:14,373 --> 00:32:15,174
Rank!

717
00:32:15,907 --> 00:32:17,242
[Fridge]
It's the creamer, right?

718
00:32:18,277 --> 00:32:20,442
I breathed, and there's...
I smelled his puke.

719
00:32:20,444 --> 00:32:21,481
[Joey] He's awesome.

720
00:32:22,446 --> 00:32:24,216
[all retching and yelling]

721
00:32:28,419 --> 00:32:30,723
- [hip-hop song playing]
- [man rapping]

722
00:32:38,262 --> 00:32:39,128
[song fades]

723
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:40,699
[Elliot]
My T-shirt is covered in vomit.

724
00:32:40,898 --> 00:32:42,167
[Joey]
Fine, here's another one.

725
00:32:42,367 --> 00:32:43,435
[Elliot] Oh, God.

726
00:32:44,368 --> 00:32:45,704
[Joey exhales]

727
00:32:47,606 --> 00:32:49,242
- [man] No. No, here.
- [bell jingles]

728
00:32:49,707 --> 00:32:53,375
No. No, no,
you're not gonna have that. No.

729
00:32:53,377 --> 00:32:54,713
Sorry. Sorry, just...

730
00:32:56,447 --> 00:32:57,449
Sorry. You know...

731
00:33:00,851 --> 00:33:02,919
Praise the Lord
on this fine day.

732
00:33:02,921 --> 00:33:03,655
Praise him.

733
00:33:06,491 --> 00:33:08,224
Yup... praise him.

734
00:33:08,226 --> 00:33:12,497
Has the Lord exposed himself
to you in all his ways?

735
00:33:13,498 --> 00:33:16,900
Exposed himself?
I would say... not... not... not...

736
00:33:16,902 --> 00:33:20,436
Do you have tea?
Could I get a cup of tea?

737
00:33:20,438 --> 00:33:24,242
By the grace of the Lord,
we have tea of the iced variety.

738
00:33:24,509 --> 00:33:25,778
Okay, not hot tea?

739
00:33:26,944 --> 00:33:28,912
If iced tea was good enough
for Jesus at the Last Supper,

740
00:33:28,914 --> 00:33:30,313
it's good enough for you, buddy.

741
00:33:30,315 --> 00:33:31,350
Amen.

742
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,319
All right.

743
00:33:34,386 --> 00:33:36,888
I'm not sure that's biblically
accurate, you know?

744
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:40,890
Uh... Orange soda, then, instead.
That would be great.

745
00:33:40,892 --> 00:33:41,661
Big Slurp?

746
00:33:43,261 --> 00:33:44,994
Yes. One of those.
Not quite sure what it means,

747
00:33:44,996 --> 00:33:47,430
- but I'll trust this gentleman.
- [man] No.

748
00:33:47,432 --> 00:33:50,203
Praise the Lord.
Big Slurp it is.

749
00:33:52,671 --> 00:33:55,540
- [man] What? Come on.
- Okay.

750
00:33:58,844 --> 00:34:00,846
Sorry, are we gonna be
sharing this?

751
00:34:01,413 --> 00:34:02,479
No, we're not.

752
00:34:02,481 --> 00:34:05,885
3.99. In God we trust.

753
00:34:07,286 --> 00:34:09,451
- Yeah, I wish you'd hurry up, too.
- Okay, sorry.

754
00:34:09,453 --> 00:34:09,988
Have a nice day.

755
00:34:11,423 --> 00:34:12,788
Go with God.

756
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:14,758
You're in God's country.

757
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,959
[Elliot] I noticed, thank you.
It's very nice.

758
00:34:15,961 --> 00:34:17,229
We're his favorite.

759
00:34:27,372 --> 00:34:30,743
I found us a motel
50 miles from here.

760
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:32,444
And it says here...

761
00:34:33,845 --> 00:34:37,350
it's Ladies Night
across the street,

762
00:34:37,716 --> 00:34:39,785
at the adults only bar.

763
00:34:40,785 --> 00:34:43,822
Hey, man, chill, okay?
Dad gotta take a pee.

764
00:34:45,524 --> 00:34:46,292
[boy] Okay.

765
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,596
- [groans]
- [urinating]

766
00:34:53,865 --> 00:34:54,964
- Oh!
- [giggles]

767
00:34:54,966 --> 00:34:57,033
No. No,
you shouldn't be in here.

768
00:34:57,035 --> 00:34:58,537
Boy, what you be doing?

769
00:34:59,104 --> 00:35:00,970
Get out.
Please, respect my privacy.

770
00:35:00,972 --> 00:35:01,803
[boy talking,
indistinct]

771
00:35:01,805 --> 00:35:03,441
[Elliot]
You could not be in here.

772
00:35:03,874 --> 00:35:05,008
- Oh, hell, no!
- Get out.

773
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:06,912
[boy laughing]

774
00:35:08,979 --> 00:35:11,850
No, no, no! This must look
rather inappropriate.

775
00:35:12,651 --> 00:35:14,654
You nasty motherfucker!

776
00:35:14,986 --> 00:35:17,823
- Wait, I can't find Princess.
- Princess is gonna take a little time-out.

777
00:35:19,091 --> 00:35:21,527
Go! Start the car!

778
00:35:22,727 --> 00:35:23,561
[Joey] What are you doing?

779
00:35:24,428 --> 00:35:25,298
Go! Go, go!

780
00:35:25,997 --> 00:35:27,363
Go! Go!

781
00:35:27,365 --> 00:35:28,533
- Go! Go! Go!
- That's right, you better run!

782
00:35:29,935 --> 00:35:31,470
You better run. I'll find you.

783
00:35:31,769 --> 00:35:33,472
- Come on!
- Big-Slurping motherfucker!

784
00:35:34,004 --> 00:35:35,772
- [boy laughing]
- It's not funny.

785
00:35:35,774 --> 00:35:37,540
[laughing continues]

786
00:35:37,542 --> 00:35:38,611
It's not funny.

787
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,477
[Joey] Did you just lure
that man's child?

788
00:35:41,479 --> 00:35:43,379
[Elliot] No, I didn't do
any luring at all.

789
00:35:43,381 --> 00:35:45,717
Okay, I think the real question
is: Are you a child molester?

790
00:35:46,385 --> 00:35:49,522
No, I didn't think we'd actually have
to clarify that bit. No, I am not.

791
00:35:50,388 --> 00:35:52,821
- Is this a British thing?
- Yeah, I hear Brits are really into that.

792
00:35:52,823 --> 00:35:53,459
[Fridge]
Yeah.

793
00:35:54,593 --> 00:35:56,392
- I'm not down with that.
- [all laughing]

794
00:35:56,394 --> 00:35:57,361
[Elliot] Ha, ha, ha, ha.

795
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:59,631
- That's not cool.
- Very funny. Very, very funny.

796
00:36:00,698 --> 00:36:02,064
- Give me a K!
- [all] K!

797
00:36:02,066 --> 00:36:04,066
You got your K,
you got your K!

798
00:36:04,068 --> 00:36:05,769
Give me an A! A!

799
00:36:05,771 --> 00:36:07,870
You got your A,
you got your A!

800
00:36:07,872 --> 00:36:09,071
- Give me a double-P!
- Double-P!

801
00:36:09,073 --> 00:36:10,973
You got your P,
you got your P!

802
00:36:10,975 --> 00:36:11,843
Give me an A!

803
00:36:13,044 --> 00:36:13,846
I don't know this song.

804
00:36:15,714 --> 00:36:16,682
Give me an A!

805
00:36:17,415 --> 00:36:18,050
You got your A.

806
00:36:19,684 --> 00:36:21,553
[singing in Spanish]

807
00:36:28,693 --> 00:36:31,897
[holds note]

808
00:36:32,863 --> 00:36:34,999
[singing continues,
stops]

809
00:36:38,437 --> 00:36:42,439
There's a gas station up the road,
if she could have just waited.

810
00:36:42,441 --> 00:36:43,542
I can hear you.

811
00:36:43,809 --> 00:36:46,442
When I have to go,
I have to go!

812
00:36:46,444 --> 00:36:49,446
I heard Brad Schlonghauser's
gonna be at this party.

813
00:36:49,448 --> 00:36:51,083
Oh, God, don't tell me that.

814
00:36:51,816 --> 00:36:53,850
Why? This could be your chance
to get him back.

815
00:36:53,852 --> 00:36:55,554
I don't want him back.

816
00:36:55,854 --> 00:36:58,187
Him dumping me was the best
thing that could have happened.

817
00:36:58,189 --> 00:37:00,091
He's like a juiced-up
Ken doll.

818
00:37:00,859 --> 00:37:02,995
Can you turn the other way? You're
kind of giving me stage fright.

819
00:37:04,528 --> 00:37:05,530
I seen it all before.

820
00:37:06,765 --> 00:37:07,533
[whispers]
Lots of times.

821
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,102
- Sky?
- Can you hurry this up?

822
00:37:12,102 --> 00:37:12,871
Thank you.

823
00:37:14,472 --> 00:37:16,506
"Hey ladies, I'm Brad.

824
00:37:16,508 --> 00:37:20,209
I've got a plastic stump instead
of a dick, like an action figure."

825
00:37:20,211 --> 00:37:23,979
"Hey ladies, I'm Brad. I Instagram
myself daily at the gym,

826
00:37:23,981 --> 00:37:24,983
doing squats."

827
00:37:25,917 --> 00:37:28,051
[Amy] But he's so hot,
though.

828
00:37:28,053 --> 00:37:29,752
I feel like we've been here
for an hour.

829
00:37:29,754 --> 00:37:32,658
Okay, well, it takes me a long
time because you kept talking.

830
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:34,526
- Well, now it's my turn, so...
- Okay.

831
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,662
Look out for a girl.

832
00:37:37,162 --> 00:37:37,897
[grunts]

833
00:37:40,064 --> 00:37:41,499
You'll need to
find some tissue.

834
00:37:42,633 --> 00:37:43,802
I have a feeling this isn't
just gonna be a number one.

835
00:37:44,568 --> 00:37:45,868
- [farts]
- Sky?

836
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:47,504
Oh, my fucking God.

837
00:37:47,506 --> 00:37:48,140
[Shu] Sky?

838
00:37:50,575 --> 00:37:52,107
Oh, my... Oh, my God.

839
00:37:52,109 --> 00:37:53,111
Oh, my God!

840
00:37:53,678 --> 00:37:56,044
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

841
00:37:56,046 --> 00:37:58,016
Oh, my God, that's deadly!

842
00:38:02,086 --> 00:38:04,489
[Joey] Yo, stop the car!
Yo, back up. Back up.

843
00:38:05,122 --> 00:38:06,157
[Sean] Oh, come on, Joey, no.

844
00:38:08,059 --> 00:38:09,461
[bell jingles]

845
00:38:11,196 --> 00:38:13,595
It's just frat letters
on my chest... KOK.

846
00:38:13,597 --> 00:38:14,730
- [door closes]
- [bell jingles]

847
00:38:14,732 --> 00:38:16,165
Like a true frat star
for the party.

848
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:19,134
Yeah, but it's not just for the
party, it's your life, man.

849
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:20,035
It's permanent.

850
00:38:20,037 --> 00:38:22,574
Yeah, we're frat brothers
for life, so...

851
00:38:23,107 --> 00:38:24,008
I'm cool with permanent.

852
00:38:25,943 --> 00:38:27,779
You little lambs
got an appointment?

853
00:38:28,647 --> 00:38:29,982
"Little lambs"?

854
00:38:31,316 --> 00:38:33,750
Not that you need one. I ain't
done a tattoo in over a month.

855
00:38:33,752 --> 00:38:35,151
[chuckles]

856
00:38:35,153 --> 00:38:36,522
Yo, I've changed my mind.

857
00:38:37,088 --> 00:38:38,122
- Thank God, let's go.
- No.

858
00:38:39,823 --> 00:38:40,626
I don't want the frat letters.

859
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,928
I want those.

860
00:38:44,361 --> 00:38:47,265
Oh, no, no, no. See, those are in
memory of people who have passed away.

861
00:38:47,865 --> 00:38:48,967
Sorry for your loss.

862
00:38:50,234 --> 00:38:51,937
Or people you've murdered.

863
00:38:52,736 --> 00:38:54,539
- What?
- Right.

864
00:38:54,772 --> 00:38:55,872
[whispers] Let's get
the fuck out of here.

865
00:38:55,874 --> 00:38:56,939
I wanna rock that shit.

866
00:38:56,941 --> 00:38:59,142
- Joe, I love you.
- Homo.

867
00:38:59,144 --> 00:39:02,111
You're my brother, but you gotta
trust me when I tell you,

868
00:39:02,113 --> 00:39:04,116
you don't want that
tattooed on your face.

869
00:39:04,582 --> 00:39:05,818
I want it in memory of Mom.

870
00:39:08,185 --> 00:39:09,053
Oh, well...

871
00:39:11,156 --> 00:39:12,758
[needle buzzing]

872
00:39:13,892 --> 00:39:14,993
[meows]

873
00:39:16,694 --> 00:39:17,830
Damn dog.

874
00:39:18,997 --> 00:39:20,129
He's shitting all over the house.
It's everywhere.

875
00:39:20,131 --> 00:39:21,064
Oh, God.

876
00:39:21,066 --> 00:39:22,701
- [sneezes]
- Oh, dear God.

877
00:39:22,968 --> 00:39:24,537
[buzzing continues]

878
00:39:24,736 --> 00:39:26,038
- [man] You got a name?
- Joey.

879
00:39:26,805 --> 00:39:28,173
AKA Young Joseph.

880
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,009
They call me Dirty.

881
00:39:31,343 --> 00:39:32,845
You know how I got my name?

882
00:39:33,144 --> 00:39:35,046
Well, it wouldn't take a
rocket scientist, right?

883
00:39:35,379 --> 00:39:37,212
No, why?

884
00:39:37,214 --> 00:39:40,116
Now, it all started when I was
just, like, a little gator.

885
00:39:40,118 --> 00:39:42,919
You know, I'd run around fixing
what needed to be fixing...

886
00:39:42,921 --> 00:39:45,888
[chuckles] and beating on
whatever needed to be beat on.

887
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:49,625
And my auntie was breastfeeding
my baby sister.

888
00:39:49,627 --> 00:39:53,129
And I come in from the yard
all covered in mud and blood.

889
00:39:53,131 --> 00:39:55,734
Now, my momma said,
"Boy, your hands are..."

890
00:39:57,035 --> 00:39:58,870
- Dirty?
- "Delicate."

891
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,803
So she tells me to use my hands

892
00:40:01,805 --> 00:40:04,042
to clean the dead vermin
out of the drain.

893
00:40:04,309 --> 00:40:07,680
So, I reach my hands
right down in there

894
00:40:08,146 --> 00:40:11,013
and use my nails
to scrape off the goo and guts.

895
00:40:11,015 --> 00:40:12,350
And my daddy says,

896
00:40:12,816 --> 00:40:15,787
- "Boy, you sure are..."
- Dirty.

897
00:40:16,854 --> 00:40:17,722
"Detailed."

898
00:40:19,823 --> 00:40:21,961
Years later,
when I got my own trailer,

899
00:40:22,693 --> 00:40:24,862
and the refrigerator's
full of mice

900
00:40:25,162 --> 00:40:26,928
and the john's full of flies

901
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:29,200
and there's roaches
all over the bed,

902
00:40:29,734 --> 00:40:32,705
everybody kept saying,
"Boy, your trailer sure is..."

903
00:40:34,238 --> 00:40:37,006
Well, I mean, I think the
word should be "dirty,"

904
00:40:37,008 --> 00:40:38,711
but I'm guessing
it was something else.

905
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:39,812
"Designer."

906
00:40:40,678 --> 00:40:42,145
[laughs]

907
00:40:42,147 --> 00:40:44,650
And I laugh. I laugh, like a...

908
00:40:46,251 --> 00:40:48,854
[laughs and coughs]

909
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:54,892
[laughing nervously]

910
00:40:57,227 --> 00:40:59,130
Grown man being called designer?

911
00:41:00,298 --> 00:41:03,198
Well, that sure is funny.

912
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,801
Um... So, maybe we should
just end on that high note.

913
00:41:05,803 --> 00:41:07,270
- Maybe we should.
- Yeah.

914
00:41:07,272 --> 00:41:10,776
No, no, no, guys. Before we go,
we should probably find out.

915
00:41:11,142 --> 00:41:13,779
Why do they call you "Dirty"?

916
00:41:15,979 --> 00:41:20,019
My twin brother. He's an
unhygienic piece of shit.

917
00:41:20,385 --> 00:41:23,122
They always getting us
confused and the name stuck.

918
00:41:24,122 --> 00:41:26,357
Mistaken identity. I hate when
that shit happens, you know?

919
00:41:27,825 --> 00:41:29,091
[Joey laughs crazily]

920
00:41:29,093 --> 00:41:31,129
So, how much does this cost?

921
00:41:31,495 --> 00:41:34,298
- Two hundred dollars.
- Fuck that. I can't afford that.

922
00:41:34,832 --> 00:41:37,165
- Excuse me?
- Okay, how about a hundred?

923
00:41:37,167 --> 00:41:39,167
Hey, how about 300?

924
00:41:39,169 --> 00:41:42,037
How about payment
in the form of a pet cat?

925
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:44,073
Fuck you and your cat.

926
00:41:44,075 --> 00:41:46,345
[Elliot] How much would the work
you've already done cost us?

927
00:41:50,013 --> 00:41:50,816
Fifty dollars.

928
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:55,053
- Yeah?
- [Elliot] That was worth it.

929
00:41:58,122 --> 00:41:59,758
I dig it. That's cool.

930
00:42:02,926 --> 00:42:05,060
Oh, wow, place looks good, Shu.
Nice work.

931
00:42:05,062 --> 00:42:06,898
You're welcome. Give it up.

932
00:42:07,464 --> 00:42:09,334
[Shu] Are you still
bringing your bedsheets?

933
00:42:09,801 --> 00:42:11,837
Do you know how dirty
the hotel ones are?

934
00:42:12,069 --> 00:42:12,870
Hell, yeah.

935
00:42:13,138 --> 00:42:15,171
I saw a documentary.

936
00:42:15,173 --> 00:42:18,010
They found 6,000 traces of shit just
on the light switch of the hotel.

937
00:42:18,776 --> 00:42:22,080
And, like, ten million
traces of, like, jizz

938
00:42:22,347 --> 00:42:24,816
all over the TV screen, like...
[imitates spraying]

939
00:42:25,415 --> 00:42:26,452
- [yelps]
- Oh.

940
00:42:27,785 --> 00:42:30,486
Let's play truth or dare
tonight.

941
00:42:30,488 --> 00:42:32,725
- Oh, my God.
- What are we, five years old?

942
00:42:33,258 --> 00:42:34,158
I don't play that game anymore.

943
00:42:34,792 --> 00:42:35,794
That's how I ended up in county.

944
00:42:36,327 --> 00:42:37,495
As in, county jail?

945
00:42:39,129 --> 00:42:41,133
What? I didn't know
you went to jail.

946
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,435
Think they'd let me work at school
if they knew I served time?

947
00:42:44,968 --> 00:42:47,035
I stole someone's identity.
We're all good.

948
00:42:47,037 --> 00:42:48,072
[nervous chuckle]

[grunts, exhales]

950
00:42:51,176 --> 00:42:52,411
Amy, bedmates.

951
00:42:52,877 --> 00:42:53,812
For sure.

952
00:42:55,046 --> 00:42:56,248
Don't drop the soap.

953
00:42:58,348 --> 00:43:00,218
[Elliot] Oh, for fuck's sake.

954
00:43:00,984 --> 00:43:02,884
[Fridge] I don't know, it's got
pretty good reviews online.

955
00:43:02,886 --> 00:43:05,124
[Sean] Yeah, from serial killers
and rapists?

956
00:43:07,191 --> 00:43:08,426
No, I got it. I got it.

957
00:43:17,202 --> 00:43:18,267
- Just come on.
- I got it.

958
00:43:18,269 --> 00:43:20,071
- Come on.
- No, I got it. I got it.

959
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:22,374
Dude.

960
00:43:24,475 --> 00:43:25,444
- Thanks, guys.
- No problem.

- [Joey] Are you open?
- [sighs]

964
00:43:32,984 --> 00:43:34,219
Of course we're open, man.

965

[speaks foreign

966
00:43:38,089 --> 00:43:39,792
And I'm the best around here,
do you know?

967
00:43:40,057 --> 00:43:42,460
I watch movies all the time.
I watch all day...

968

[speaking

969
00:43:46,064 --> 00:43:47,065
How you doing?

970
00:43:48,131 --> 00:43:49,801
- Me?
- Are you talking to me?

- No, that's definitely not British.

- How do you know?
- That's not British.

978

- How do you know?
- Don't worry.

979
00:44:10,888 --> 00:44:12,490
I studied languages
in high school.

980
00:44:13,156 --> 00:44:15,093
I'll take care of this.
[clears throat]

981

Um... <i>Achtung.</i>
We want a room.

982
00:44:19,097 --> 00:44:20,363
No, fuck that.
I'm not sharing a room.

983
00:44:20,365 --> 00:44:22,397
- [Elliot] Why?
- Because...

984
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:24,399
I'm bringing chicks back and I don't
need you freaks voyeuring in on me.

985
00:44:24,401 --> 00:44:26,201
Where do you expect
to find women?

986
00:44:26,203 --> 00:44:28,303
- I told you there was a hook-up adult place across the street.
- Huh?

987
00:44:28,305 --> 00:44:29,607
How are you gonna get in?
Come on.

988
00:44:31,575 --> 00:44:35,410
[whispers] Tonight is
special on some ladies.

989
00:44:35,412 --> 00:44:38,214
- Ladies?
- Some... sex!

990
00:44:38,216 --> 00:44:40,015
- [Joey] Sex? Yes.
- I definitely heard something about sex.

991
00:44:40,017 --> 00:44:42,887
Fuck, yeah. Let's get wasted
and have some sex with ladies.

992
00:44:43,521 --> 00:44:45,587
You know what? I'm beat.
I'm just gonna go to bed.

993
00:44:45,589 --> 00:44:48,591
Yeah, you know what? I just wanna lay
down in my bed and think about Fatima.

994
00:44:48,593 --> 00:44:50,091
No.

995
00:44:50,093 --> 00:44:52,595
- It has been quite a long day.
- No. What? What? No.

996
00:44:52,597 --> 00:44:54,330
You'll wingman with me, yes?
Uh-huh?

997
00:44:54,332 --> 00:44:55,334
- Uh...
- Two rooms, my dude.

998
00:44:56,535 --> 00:44:57,500
You two choads can jerk each
other off in your room.

999
00:44:57,502 --> 00:44:59,567
Me and the Brit
are gonna be Eiffel Towering.

1000
00:44:59,569 --> 00:45:00,305
[Elliot]
What does that mean?

1001

[PA: Muzak]

1002
00:45:14,118 --> 00:45:16,185
This is slightly disappointing.

1003
00:45:16,187 --> 00:45:17,122
It's a little early.

1004
00:45:17,622 --> 00:45:18,457
Yeah.

1005
00:45:19,356 --> 00:45:20,224
Let's get some drinks.

1006
00:45:21,091 --> 00:45:22,660
- All right. Okay.
- Let's get some drinks.

1007
00:45:25,129 --> 00:45:26,531
[Joey] Line us up some
brew-ha-has, my man.

1008
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,502
No?

1009
00:45:31,401 --> 00:45:33,004
We're serving
brain-ticklers tonight.

1010
00:45:34,638 --> 00:45:37,573
Hmm. Not... Probably not quite
what we had in mind. Is there...

1011
00:45:37,575 --> 00:45:38,944
That's all we're serving.

1012
00:45:39,644 --> 00:45:40,479
What's in a brain-tickler?

1013
00:45:41,546 --> 00:45:43,048
Brain. Tickler.

1014
00:45:44,214 --> 00:45:45,050
Yeah,
I'm gonna take two of them.

1015
00:45:46,249 --> 00:45:47,385
- [Elliot] Um...
- [Joey] Yeah, you are.

1016
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,321
- Beer or wine or...
- Stop.

1017
00:45:51,356 --> 00:45:52,290
Um...

1018

[clicking tongue]

1019
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:58,263
So have you, like, thought about
what you wanna do as a job?

1020
00:45:58,595 --> 00:46:00,462
Like, career path or anything?

1021
00:46:00,464 --> 00:46:01,432
Is that a rhetorical question?

1022
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,635
No. No.

1023
00:46:04,167 --> 00:46:07,069
I'm not completely sure
you know what rhetorical means.

1024
00:46:07,071 --> 00:46:08,504
Of course I do.
I know what rhetorical means.

1025
00:46:08,506 --> 00:46:10,107
It's just your British accent.

1026
00:46:16,113 --> 00:46:16,714
Ah...

1027
00:46:17,515 --> 00:46:18,417
Cheers.

1028
00:46:21,551 --> 00:46:22,254

Ooh, I don't know.

1033
00:46:31,796 --> 00:46:33,495
And you can keep them flowing.

- You look a little weird.

1036
00:46:37,568 --> 00:46:39,234
Feeling quite uncomfortable,
actually. Quite strange.

1037
00:46:39,236 --> 00:46:40,368
I feel great.

on this whole, like,

to just be nice, you know?

No. No. None of this nice guy,
British bullshit.

1054
00:47:43,501 --> 00:47:44,502
It's... It's bullshit.

I just... I like to be
nice and polite here.

1091
00:49:37,347 --> 00:49:37,915
How you doing?

1092
00:49:41,252 --> 00:49:44,352
Hey. Hey there,
Mr. James Bond.

1093
00:49:44,354 --> 00:49:45,654
I still need to get paid.

1094
00:49:45,656 --> 00:49:46,754
What, a righteous one?

1095
00:49:46,756 --> 00:49:48,357
Oh, what are you
hiding under there?

1096
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:50,725
- Nothing.
- Is somebody else awake, finally?

1097
00:49:50,727 --> 00:49:53,361
- No!
- Come on, 007.

1098
00:49:53,363 --> 00:49:56,497
- No, no!
- This dirty troll still wants to get shagged.

1099
00:49:56,499 --> 00:49:58,299
- Go away.
- Fancy a little rough-housing, eh?

1100
00:49:58,301 --> 00:49:59,734
No, I don't. No...
[groans]

1101
00:49:59,736 --> 00:50:01,337
- A little rough-housing will do you.
- No.

1102
00:50:01,339 --> 00:50:02,638
Huh? Huh?

1103
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,542
Like it rough, a little rough?

1104
00:50:04,908 --> 00:50:06,575
You like... You like...

1105
00:50:06,577 --> 00:50:07,810
[Elliot whimpering]

1106
00:50:07,812 --> 00:50:08,644
- [kicks]
- Get...

1107
00:50:08,646 --> 00:50:09,814
- Oh!
- [body thuds]

1108
00:50:11,649 --> 00:50:12,484
[Joey] Dude.

1109
00:50:13,551 --> 00:50:14,553
Did you just knock her out?

1110
00:50:14,752 --> 00:50:16,986
No, I... It's not a her,
it's a he.

1111
00:50:16,988 --> 00:50:18,654
It's a man. It's a man.

1112
00:50:18,656 --> 00:50:21,022
- [kissing noise]
- Oh, shit!

1113

[shouts, laughs]

1115
00:50:24,028 --> 00:50:25,961
- I'm sorry.
- What did you do to Travis?

1116
00:50:25,963 --> 00:50:26,897
No. I'm sorry.
[screams]

1117
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,270
[Sean] You did not! Oh, my God!

1118
00:50:32,535 --> 00:50:34,370
[Fridge] Wow. You're really
into some freaky shit, huh?

1119
00:50:34,372 --> 00:50:36,839
First you molest a kid
and now you fight a tranny?

1120
00:50:36,841 --> 00:50:40,743
I didn't... know she was a he. That
brain-tickler drink fucked me up.

1121
00:50:40,745 --> 00:50:42,380
[Sean] Well, you didn't
have to beat her.

1122
00:50:43,948 --> 00:50:46,982
How about you try wrestling with a 200-pound
man-woman trying to grab your penis?

1123
00:50:46,984 --> 00:50:48,450
- I have!
- What?

1124
00:50:48,452 --> 00:50:51,356
- Did you do anything with her?
- No! Thank God.

1125
00:50:52,789 --> 00:50:53,724
Joe?

1126
00:50:54,925 --> 00:50:56,058
[Joey] Define "anything."

1127
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:57,325
- [Sean] No!
- [Fridge] What?

1128
00:50:57,327 --> 00:50:59,663
Oh! [laughing] Oh!

1129
00:51:01,798 --> 00:51:03,501
[Sean] So, what did your lover
think of your new tat?

1130
00:51:06,771 --> 00:51:07,738
What?

1131
00:51:09,307 --> 00:51:11,810
Oh, whatever. Let's not act like I'm the
only one who got in bed with a tranny.

1132
00:51:14,879 --> 00:51:18,346
Anyways, at least my plan to get
El laid paid off. [laughing]

1133
00:51:18,348 --> 00:51:19,948
No, I didn't...
But I didn't get laid.

1134
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:21,450
Can we just make that
totally clear?

1135
00:51:21,452 --> 00:51:23,354
I didn't do anything
with her, okay?

1136
00:51:25,423 --> 00:51:27,689
Point is... my plan is legit.

1137
00:51:27,691 --> 00:51:29,894
If you do that at the frat party,
panties are gonna just drop.

1138
00:51:30,894 --> 00:51:31,959
- No.
- Yeah.

1139
00:51:31,961 --> 00:51:32,795
No.

1140
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:35,763
And look,
I'm really sorry to disappoint,

1141
00:51:35,765 --> 00:51:39,738
but I'm not into this whole, like,
"Let's get lots of chicks" thing.

1142
00:51:42,006 --> 00:51:43,841
Oh, please don't tell me
what I think you're gonna say.

1143
00:51:44,475 --> 00:51:45,441
What?

1144
00:51:45,443 --> 00:51:47,075
Please don't tell me you're gay.

1145
00:51:47,077 --> 00:51:49,111
I already have one gay brother, and
I just... I don't want another one.

1146
00:51:49,113 --> 00:51:50,682
I'm not gay, dude.

1147
00:51:52,682 --> 00:51:53,885
[Joey] Yeah,
we're going the wrong way.

1148
00:51:54,084 --> 00:51:55,720
[Sean] No, Skylar has
that surprise.

1149
00:51:59,589 --> 00:52:00,959
[Joey laughing]

1150
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:02,524
You're disgusting.

1151
00:52:02,526 --> 00:52:03,728
[Joey] Oh, you should pull
your dick out.

1152
00:52:03,928 --> 00:52:05,730
I have no desire to do that.

1153
00:52:08,031 --> 00:52:08,999
What is this place?

1154
00:52:18,508 --> 00:52:19,910
Whoo-hoo!

1155
00:52:22,479 --> 00:52:24,011
[screaming, laughing]

1156
00:52:24,013 --> 00:52:26,818
[yelling]

1157
00:52:41,499 --> 00:52:42,834
Whoa! Oh!

1158
00:52:44,901 --> 00:52:46,804
[laughs]

1159
00:52:52,776 --> 00:52:54,044
I want to go home!

1160
00:53:01,051 --> 00:53:04,856
- So...
- Uh, so, this is crazy.

1161
00:53:05,055 --> 00:53:06,921
I don't know how you
found a place like this.

1162
00:53:06,923 --> 00:53:08,892
No, what do you think
of your new family?

1163
00:53:09,926 --> 00:53:12,930
Oh.
Yeah, they're, um...

1164
00:53:15,432 --> 00:53:17,968
- They're gr... They're great. They're...
- Yeah. They are.

1165
00:53:20,805 --> 00:53:22,906
Just so you know, this is the
happiest I've ever seen them.

1166
00:53:24,874 --> 00:53:26,143
It really sucked
when their mom died.

1167
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:31,515
Your mom has really
transformed Michaelson.

1168
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:39,488
Eh... He's a bit odd,
isn't he?

1169
00:53:39,490 --> 00:53:41,426
- Oh, he's weird as shit.
- Yeah. Yeah, I think.

1170
00:53:41,859 --> 00:53:42,994
But in the best way.

1171
00:53:46,464 --> 00:53:48,767
To be honest, the fact he's around
makes him better than my dad was.

1172
00:53:49,732 --> 00:53:51,970
I just don't want to see my mom
getting hurt again.

1173
00:53:54,004 --> 00:53:57,142
Anyway... I shouldn't
talk to you about that.

1174
00:53:57,807 --> 00:54:00,644
No, of course. It's your mom.

1175
00:54:00,977 --> 00:54:01,745
You should be protective.

1176
00:54:03,481 --> 00:54:04,745
I can't wait to meet her,
by the way.

1177
00:54:04,747 --> 00:54:06,747
Oh, she can't wait
to meet you, yeah.

1178
00:54:06,749 --> 00:54:08,685
- You told her about me.
- No, I didn't.

1179
00:54:09,486 --> 00:54:10,155
Um...

1180
00:54:10,787 --> 00:54:12,423
No, maybe. I think just in...

1181
00:54:12,856 --> 00:54:14,725
- I don't know, maybe in passing.
- Right, yeah.

1182
00:54:16,026 --> 00:54:16,660
Just in passing.

1183
00:54:18,062 --> 00:54:19,464
Just an accident
or something.

1184
00:54:25,169 --> 00:54:27,002
So, I heard Fridge
is riding with the girls.

1185
00:54:27,004 --> 00:54:27,872
Do you want to come in our car?

1186
00:54:28,705 --> 00:54:29,841
Yeah, I'd love to.

1187
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:46,957
I'm a real aficionado
for humorous apparel.

1188
00:54:47,857 --> 00:54:50,727
I have a range of humorous,
hilarious T-shirts.

1189
00:54:51,095 --> 00:54:53,698
Such as "Orgasm Donor."

1190
00:54:53,897 --> 00:54:56,131
Oh, like in "organ donor,"

1191
00:54:56,133 --> 00:54:57,100
- but with an orgasm.
- Orgasm.

1192
00:54:58,167 --> 00:54:59,838
- Yeah.
- I appreciate that.

1193
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:02,571
I have another one that says,

1194
00:55:02,573 --> 00:55:05,910
"My idea of a balanced meal
is a beer in each hand."

1195
00:55:06,544 --> 00:55:07,145
Amen.

1196
00:55:08,044 --> 00:55:09,977
Please stop.

1197
00:55:09,979 --> 00:55:12,548
And I just ordered this new one.
It says, "FBI,"

1198
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:13,651
but underneath it, it says...

1199
00:55:14,651 --> 00:55:15,819
Oh, "Female Body Inspector."

1200
00:55:16,754 --> 00:55:17,789
Yeah.

1201
00:55:25,963 --> 00:55:28,600
[Amy] I swear I'm gonna
crash this fucking car.

1202
00:55:28,798 --> 00:55:31,700
I got dumped, had to move
back in with my parents

1203
00:55:31,702 --> 00:55:34,671
because my salary doesn't cover
my student loan payments.

1204
00:55:35,606 --> 00:55:37,305
- It sucks.
- Yeah.

1205
00:55:37,307 --> 00:55:40,210
But how boring would it be if we
had it all figured out, right?

1206
00:55:40,843 --> 00:55:42,944
That's true. It would be
pretty boring, wouldn't it?

1207
00:55:42,946 --> 00:55:43,981
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1208
00:55:45,249 --> 00:55:46,917
What an idiot.

1209
00:55:48,385 --> 00:55:50,120
Your ex-boyfriend. A complete moron.
He's... He's gonna regret that forever.

1210
00:55:50,921 --> 00:55:52,787
I don't think he cares.

1211
00:55:52,789 --> 00:55:54,691
- Really?
- Apparently, he wanted someone better.

1212
00:55:55,325 --> 00:55:56,894
- That's why my ex dumped me.
- Really?

1213
00:55:57,595 --> 00:55:58,794
Well, she lost a keeper.

1214
00:55:58,796 --> 00:56:00,598
- She did, didn't she?
- Yeah, screw her!

1215
00:56:01,097 --> 00:56:02,165
Screw her.

1216
00:56:02,665 --> 00:56:04,799
Does she know that you're
a P-I-M-P?

1217
00:56:04,801 --> 00:56:06,104
I am a P-I-M-P.

1218
00:56:06,903 --> 00:56:08,639
I am. How did you know?

1219
00:56:09,339 --> 00:56:10,542
Okay. Turn your head.

1220
00:56:15,312 --> 00:56:16,681
No, Joey.

1221
00:56:20,084 --> 00:56:21,586
Can you drop me
at the sorority, Sean?

1222
00:56:22,252 --> 00:56:23,788
[Sean] Okay.
Can I come?

1223
00:56:41,171 --> 00:56:42,937
[all saying goodbye]

1224
00:56:42,939 --> 00:56:43,675
[Skylar] Bye-bye.

1225
00:56:46,075 --> 00:56:46,774
[Elliot] Don't let him in.

1226
00:56:46,776 --> 00:56:47,345
Fridge.

1227
00:56:47,877 --> 00:56:48,879
Come on, Fridge.

1228
00:56:49,912 --> 00:56:51,115
- Do it again.
- No, no, for real.

1229
00:56:52,015 --> 00:56:54,351
- Okay.
- Yay!

1230
00:56:55,185 --> 00:56:56,220
[Fatima]
See you at the party!

1231
00:56:57,187 --> 00:57:00,091
Whoo! College, baby!
Young Joseph is back!

1232
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:07,699
[Elliot] Are we here?

1233
00:57:08,533 --> 00:57:09,801
Is this it?
Is this the fraternity?

1234
00:57:20,144 --> 00:57:21,111
[Joey] Welcome to heaven, boys.

1235
00:57:23,113 --> 00:57:24,749
Prepare for your world
to get rocked.

1236
00:57:25,682 --> 00:57:27,150
[TV, indistinct]

1237
00:57:33,057 --> 00:57:36,127
Well, I'm glad we drove all the
way for this. This is great.

1238
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,829
Oh, this is kind of
disappointing.

1239
00:57:39,095 --> 00:57:40,764
I mean,
I brought my party shirt, so...

1240
00:57:41,164 --> 00:57:42,633
[man burps]

1241
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:44,235
Bitches!

1242
00:57:44,968 --> 00:57:46,170
Oh, God fucking damn it.

1243
00:57:46,437 --> 00:57:48,437

and the only way you'll be seen
as a frat star,

1389
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,703
is if you get your bitch brother
to bang that cat.

01:05:26,763 --> 01:05:27,832
Whatever...
Whatever it takes.

1400
01:05:29,098 --> 01:05:32,399
Eric Stahl is a fucking lunatic.
All right, what does it matter?

1401
01:05:32,401 --> 01:05:34,604
Because I wanna be seen
as a frat legend again, okay?

1402
01:05:35,738 --> 01:05:38,238
You know, you may not believe this,
but my life kind of sucks right now.

1403
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:39,609
This is all Young Joseph's got.

1406
01:05:57,294 --> 01:05:58,395
Excuse me, mister.

1407
01:05:59,461 --> 01:06:01,764
I ordered a stud muffin,
and I think you might be it.

1408
01:06:05,368 --> 01:06:07,872
I know this great burrito place
around the corner.

1409
01:06:09,805 --> 01:06:11,374
What do you say
we blow this popsicle stand?

1410
01:06:14,711 --> 01:06:15,745
You had me at "burrito."

1411
01:06:18,481 --> 01:06:19,747
[electronic music
on speakers]

1412
01:06:19,749 --> 01:06:21,651
[Eric] Hey guys, how goes
the party stuff in here?

1413
01:06:22,318 --> 01:06:24,854
Oh, man,
I'm fired up some, baby.

1414
01:06:25,854 --> 01:06:26,623
What's up?

1415
01:06:32,963 --> 01:06:34,962
Should you maybe be
a bit more subtle?

1416
01:06:34,964 --> 01:06:36,767
Nah, no way, man.
You're in my house tonight.

1417
01:06:37,566 --> 01:06:39,836
My rules. My rules.

1418
01:06:53,249 --> 01:06:54,584
Are you following me
on Instagram?

1419
01:06:54,917 --> 01:06:56,486
Seen all the badass things
I've been doing?

1420
01:06:57,486 --> 01:06:59,722
- No.
- Did I tell you I drive a BMW now?

1421
01:06:59,990 --> 01:07:00,723
Don't care.

1422
01:07:01,658 --> 01:07:02,760
You rip that, Brit.

1423
01:07:03,627 --> 01:07:04,628
No, thank you.

1424
01:07:04,827 --> 01:07:05,929
Rip it good.

1425
01:07:06,363 --> 01:07:08,531
...vanity plates that say,
"Schlong."

1426
01:07:09,899 --> 01:07:12,970
The "S" is a 5,
but... still dope.

1427
01:07:14,403 --> 01:07:16,606
Rip it, Brit. Rip that shit!

1428
01:07:19,309 --> 01:07:19,810
[spits]

1429
01:07:23,479 --> 01:07:24,747
- Rip it!
- Fuck it.

1430
01:07:27,617 --> 01:07:28,519
God!

Mmm! Yes!

Oh, man, you are a maniac!

1433
01:07:34,790 --> 01:07:37,827
No, man, I didn't even know they
had fucking maniacs in the UK.

1434
01:07:42,665 --> 01:07:44,299
- Yes.
- Oh!

1435
01:07:44,301 --> 01:07:44,999
Baby!

1436
01:07:45,001 --> 01:07:47,067
That is some potent shit.

1437
01:07:47,069 --> 01:07:49,837
That is good. That is good.
I'm going to have another one.

1438
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:51,406
- Oh, man!
- Round two.

1439
01:07:51,408 --> 01:07:52,674
Mm-hmm.

1440
01:07:52,676 --> 01:07:54,408
I am a generous god, yes.

[snorting]

1442

Oh! Snagging it all
like a maniac.

1443
01:07:59,481 --> 01:08:01,381
Oh, man, I have to go poop.

1444
01:08:01,383 --> 01:08:02,719
- It's go time.
- [exhales sharply]

1445
01:08:03,653 --> 01:08:05,022
- Poop time!
- [exhales sharply]

1446
01:08:05,722 --> 01:08:08,691
Hello. Hello. Hello, you.

[snorting]

1448
01:08:12,062 --> 01:08:13,931
Hello. Hello.

1449
01:08:14,897 --> 01:08:16,667
Hey. How's it going?

1450
01:08:18,635 --> 01:08:20,801
So, I mean, they just, like, you know,
they say just be a dick to her.

1451
01:08:20,803 --> 01:08:22,336
I don't want to be a dick.

1452
01:08:22,338 --> 01:08:23,138
Because I feel like
I'm a nice guy.

1453
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:24,671
But she's with
that handsome guy.

1454
01:08:24,673 --> 01:08:25,908
She's treating me
like a dick, you know?

1455
01:08:26,409 --> 01:08:27,911
I'm gonna...
I'm just gonna try to be a dick.

1456
01:08:28,511 --> 01:08:29,312
I need to poop.

1457
01:08:30,613 --> 01:08:31,882
It's so weird
how this drug does that, right?

1458
01:08:32,681 --> 01:08:33,883
You're just, like, sniff,
and you're like...

1459
01:08:35,985 --> 01:08:37,288
Hey, there you are.

1460
01:08:38,387 --> 01:08:40,423
What's up, Skylar?

1461
01:08:40,757 --> 01:08:42,059
Nothing. What's up with you?

1462
01:08:42,624 --> 01:08:45,492
Just doing drugs and shit.

1463
01:08:45,494 --> 01:08:47,330
Gonna hit on some babes.
[sniffs]

- [burps]
- Ew.

1465
01:08:49,498 --> 01:08:50,934
All right,
I'm gonna go get a drink.

1466
01:08:51,568 --> 01:08:52,369
Okay.

1467
01:08:54,070 --> 01:08:55,539
And score me a lighter.

1468
01:08:57,940 --> 01:08:58,641
Oh, no.

1469
01:09:00,008 --> 01:09:01,477
Have you seen
a toilet round here?

1470
01:09:04,614 --> 01:09:06,784
Ooh. Don't mind if I do.

1471
01:09:08,885 --> 01:09:10,017
Ooh.

1472
01:09:10,019 --> 01:09:11,321
It's nice. Quite calming.

1473
01:09:12,323 --> 01:09:13,356
Everyone's so generous
with their narcotics.

1474
01:09:14,857 --> 01:09:15,859
You seen the toilet?

1475
01:09:16,092 --> 01:09:17,795
Brilliant. Thank you.

1476
01:09:19,428 --> 01:09:20,963
Hello. Hello. Toilet?

1477
01:09:21,431 --> 01:09:22,399
This way?

1478
01:09:23,967 --> 01:09:25,633
Oh, baby! There you are!

1479
01:09:25,635 --> 01:09:27,033
Jesus, that's rank!

1480
01:09:27,035 --> 01:09:28,635
Come on, man, it's not too late
to come join us.

- Oh, fuck.

Mmm! It's happening.
Fuck, yes!

1483
01:09:34,043 --> 01:09:36,109
Excuse me, do you know if there's
another toilet around here?

1484
01:09:36,111 --> 01:09:38,681
Shut the fuck up,
you're Australian?

1485
01:09:38,882 --> 01:09:40,581
- Uh, British.
- Shut up.

1486

- Elliot.
- O-M-G, you're so hot.

1491
01:09:53,762 --> 01:09:57,165
I'm gonna speak in a British
accent from now on.

1492
01:09:57,167 --> 01:10:00,134
- No, no, there's no need.
- [mock English accent] Would you like a spot of tea?

1493
01:10:00,136 --> 01:10:02,039
Please, nurky, have some more.

1494
01:10:04,039 --> 01:10:05,273
[coughing]
What is in that?

1495
01:10:05,275 --> 01:10:08,045
[American accent] So, Sir Elliot,
have you ever done Molly?

1496
01:10:09,044 --> 01:10:13,180
- Uh, no.
- Don't lie, liar, liar, trousers on fire.

1497
01:10:13,182 --> 01:10:14,816
You just did.

1498
01:10:14,818 --> 01:10:18,021
What? No. Why'd you give me Molly?
I don't want that.

1499
01:10:18,855 --> 01:10:20,520
Did we just have
a Molly moment?

1500
01:10:20,522 --> 01:10:22,023
I don't know what we had.
I don't know what's happening.

1501
01:10:22,025 --> 01:10:23,527
You want a light show?

1502
01:10:23,959 --> 01:10:26,693
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.
[babbling]

Whoo-whoo! [babbling]

1504
01:10:29,966 --> 01:10:31,999
Fuck.
I think I'm hyperventilating.

1505
01:10:32,001 --> 01:10:34,872
Oh, yeah, massage train, yeah!

1506
01:10:35,171 --> 01:10:37,572
Oh, there you go,
right... Oh, yeah!

1507
01:10:37,574 --> 01:10:40,110
- Suddenly I'm feeling awful.
- Do you have a phone?

1508
01:10:40,577 --> 01:10:42,643
Get your phone.
Get your phone out.

1509
01:10:42,645 --> 01:10:43,710
I can't feel my new phone.

1510
01:10:43,712 --> 01:10:44,845
- I think I lost it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1511
01:10:44,847 --> 01:10:47,081
- My heart...
- Insta-moment, Molly-faces!

1512
01:10:47,083 --> 01:10:48,652
In the camera there.
There we go.

[shutter clicking]

1514
01:10:52,922 --> 01:10:54,491
Stop. Stop!

- Stop.
- You rolling?

1516
01:10:56,926 --> 01:10:58,128
No, I'm hyperventilating.

1517
01:10:59,229 --> 01:11:00,862
- I don't know what's happening.
- Let's shag.

1518
01:11:00,864 --> 01:11:02,229
- No.
- Come on.

1519
01:11:02,231 --> 01:11:03,965
- No, please. Please.
- Come on. You know.

1520
01:11:03,967 --> 01:11:05,099
- I need a doctor.
- I'm a doctor.

1521
01:11:05,101 --> 01:11:06,533
- You pissed my bed.
- No, I didn't!

1522
01:11:06,535 --> 01:11:07,602
- Yes, you did.
- What the...

1523
01:11:07,604 --> 01:11:08,803
Yes.

1524
01:11:08,805 --> 01:11:10,804
You lost my
fucking skateboard, too.

1525
01:11:10,806 --> 01:11:12,141
[Elliot]
I don't even know who you are.

1526
01:11:13,676 --> 01:11:14,742
- You mother...
- What?

1527
01:11:14,744 --> 01:11:15,879
He's mine.

1528
01:11:16,779 --> 01:11:18,712
- You!
- I just needed the toilet.

1529
01:11:18,714 --> 01:11:20,747
- [Mimi] Just pee your pants.
- [man] I got your dick in my face!

1530
01:11:20,749 --> 01:11:23,283
- Okay, enough fun.
- You gotta go to school.

1531
01:11:23,285 --> 01:11:24,751
You try to get on the bus.

1532
01:11:24,753 --> 01:11:26,022
The sex bus!

1533
01:11:26,588 --> 01:11:28,889
Yes, you go to school.
You go to my school.

1534
01:11:28,891 --> 01:11:29,857
Give me your arm, bitch.

1535
01:11:29,859 --> 01:11:31,157
How are you so strong?

1536
01:11:31,159 --> 01:11:33,193
I take kickboxing.
It's my hobby.

1537
01:11:33,195 --> 01:11:34,564
You know, that, and knitting.

1538
01:11:35,030 --> 01:11:37,130
Knitting blankets
to have sex on!

1539
01:11:37,132 --> 01:11:38,965
- Oh, you shut up, you baby.
- [yelping]

1540

Shut up! Shut up!

Oh, here, look at the butterfly.
Yeah, look at the butterfly.

1542
01:11:41,971 --> 01:11:43,904
Now, look at the butterfly.
Now, look at the butterfly.

1543

Now, look at the butterfly.
Now, look at the butterfly.

1544
01:11:45,641 --> 01:11:46,807
- Now, look at the butterfly.
- Okay.

1545

Look at the butterfly.

1546
01:11:48,043 --> 01:11:49,812
Ooh, look at the butterfly.
Ooh!

1547
01:11:50,747 --> 01:11:52,679
- I think I'm having a panic attack.
- Oh, good, that'll help.

[dance music, muffled]

1549
01:12:04,226 --> 01:12:05,895
I'm gonna turn you
into a man tonight.

[groans]

1551
01:12:19,042 --> 01:12:20,677
Prepare to enter my forest.

1552

I love you.

1553
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:28,148
Look at the butterfly.
Look at the butterfly.

1554
01:12:28,150 --> 01:12:29,951
[vocalizing]

1555
01:12:29,953 --> 01:12:30,954
- Oh, yeah, boy!
- [yelps]

1556
01:12:31,954 --> 01:12:33,689
- Oh, my God, who is that?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey!

1557
01:12:34,156 --> 01:12:37,127
- [Elliot] Whoa.
- Well, what do we have here?

1558
01:12:40,663 --> 01:12:43,567
Here, buddy, hey.
My name's Jeffrey, with a J.

1559
01:12:44,734 --> 01:12:46,870
Nice to meet you, I'm Elliot.
Please untie me.

1560
01:12:47,235 --> 01:12:48,939
Can you help? Help.

1561
01:12:49,638 --> 01:12:50,574
Help.

1562
01:12:51,408 --> 01:12:52,575
Let's turn this into
a little threeway.

1563
01:12:52,976 --> 01:12:54,841
- No. No, no, no.
- Oh, yeah.

1564
01:12:54,843 --> 01:12:55,742
- Yes!
- No way!

1565
01:12:55,744 --> 01:12:57,111
You're only young once, right?

1566
01:12:57,113 --> 01:12:58,946
- I'm not even that young.
- Okay, look.

1567
01:12:58,948 --> 01:13:00,950
- Untie me, please.
- Look at this mouth.

1568
01:13:01,316 --> 01:13:03,651
- Look at... what? No.
- [Mimi] Oh, yeah.

1569
01:13:03,653 --> 01:13:05,051
- No.
- [Jeffrey] Like a vagina.

1570
01:13:05,053 --> 01:13:06,056
- No, it's not.
- [Mimi] Oh, yeah.

1571
01:13:07,155 --> 01:13:08,355
[muffled]

1572
01:13:08,357 --> 01:13:11,658
Oh, your accent's
so fucking hot.

1573
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:13,797
- Oh, keep talking how you do, baby.
- I don't...

1574
01:13:15,797 --> 01:13:16,930
- Help!
- You know,

1575
01:13:16,932 --> 01:13:18,601
my grandparents
are from Barcelona.

1576
01:13:19,267 --> 01:13:20,971
Barcelona, England?

1577
01:13:21,236 --> 01:13:22,638
[mock English accent]
Too right.

1578
01:13:22,971 --> 01:13:24,840
- That's not in England.
- Shut the fuck up.

1579
01:13:25,675 --> 01:13:26,243
Oh!

1580
01:13:29,645 --> 01:13:30,780
You little minx.

1581
01:13:32,181 --> 01:13:33,813
[dance music playing
on speakers]

1582
01:13:33,815 --> 01:13:35,651
[Joey]
Come on, look. Here she is.

1583
01:13:36,052 --> 01:13:38,685
Look, take her upstairs to a private
room and put on some music...

1584
01:13:38,687 --> 01:13:41,091
Dude, I can't believe you got her out
of the car. You're sick in the head.

1585
01:13:42,691 --> 01:13:44,026
I'm gonna go find Elliot.

1586
01:13:44,927 --> 01:13:46,630
- Come on, Sky. Help me out.
- No.

1587
01:13:47,963 --> 01:13:48,931
- Oh.
- [slurping]

1588
01:13:49,798 --> 01:13:51,935
W... We're just dancing,
that's all.

1589
01:13:52,834 --> 01:13:54,669
Hey, feel free to join us.

1590
01:13:54,671 --> 01:13:57,106
I can easily dance
the tongue-go with two.

1591
01:13:59,107 --> 01:14:00,877
Please don't tell anyone, Sky.

1592
01:14:01,778 --> 01:14:04,347
My self-esteem's
been kind of low recently.

1593
01:14:05,114 --> 01:14:07,050
Skeazy Steve.

1594
01:14:07,749 --> 01:14:09,849
- [door closes]
- Get back to work.

1595
01:14:09,851 --> 01:14:11,085
- [imitates motor] Hi.
- [grunts]

1596
01:14:11,087 --> 01:14:12,321
- [Elliot screaming]
- [blowing raspberries]

1597
01:14:13,989 --> 01:14:15,725
[screaming continues]
Help!

1598
01:14:19,328 --> 01:14:21,094
Help!
[screams]

1599
01:14:21,096 --> 01:14:23,165
What the fuck is going on?

1600
01:14:25,034 --> 01:14:26,103
No! No!

1601
01:14:30,172 --> 01:14:31,807
I feel like
I'm being waterboarded.

1602
01:14:32,742 --> 01:14:33,209
Stop!

1603
01:14:35,744 --> 01:14:37,243
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1604
01:14:37,245 --> 01:14:38,949
- [Elliot] Oh! No!
- [man] Oh, here we go.

1605
01:14:39,147 --> 01:14:39,882
What the...

1606
01:14:40,550 --> 01:14:43,285
Oh, isn't his accent so cute?

1607
01:14:44,820 --> 01:14:46,120
I just wanted to see
if you were okay.

1608
01:14:46,122 --> 01:14:47,854
I did not want this to happen.

1609
01:14:47,856 --> 01:14:49,055
[Mimi]
Ew, you're already taken?

1610
01:14:49,057 --> 01:14:50,224
No, wait! Skylar, wait!

1611
01:14:50,226 --> 01:14:51,662
- Please!
- Get out!

1612
01:14:52,796 --> 01:14:55,062
- Get out! Get out, you piece of shit!
- [Elliot] Get off!

1613
01:14:55,064 --> 01:14:56,732
Get off me. Horrible man.

1614
01:14:58,333 --> 01:15:00,336
Skylar. Skylar, wait!

1615
01:15:00,869 --> 01:15:02,402
- Wait, I didn't... Wait!
- [Jeffrey] Go get her, bro!

1616
01:15:02,404 --> 01:15:04,173
[dance music on speakers]

1617
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:13,013
Wait, Skylar. Please wait.

1618
01:15:13,015 --> 01:15:14,948
- What?
- Well...

1619
01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:16,386
You know what, Elliot? I just
thought you were different.

1620
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:19,085
You looked at me like you cared,

1621
01:15:19,087 --> 01:15:21,190
you opened doors for me, you
even listened to me when I talk.

1622
01:15:22,324 --> 01:15:24,093
But really, you're just
like every other guy.

1623
01:15:25,994 --> 01:15:27,698
I didn't realize you
even noticed that stuff.

1624
01:15:27,930 --> 01:15:29,199
Just have fun, Elliot.

1625
01:15:30,432 --> 01:15:32,002
It's not fair of me to get annoyed at you.
It's my own issue.

1626
01:15:32,467 --> 01:15:33,936
Okay? Forget it.

1627
01:15:37,205 --> 01:15:38,240
- Wait, but...
- [snaps fingers] Uh-uh.

1628
01:15:39,275 --> 01:15:40,143
Skylar!

1629
01:15:41,843 --> 01:15:43,477
Yo, El,
tell him to bang the cat.

1630
01:15:43,479 --> 01:15:45,347
Dude, if it's so important,
<i>you</i> fuck the cat.

1631
01:15:46,315 --> 01:15:47,050
What?

1632
01:15:47,917 --> 01:15:49,953
Okay, I can't take
this shit anymore.

1633
01:15:50,218 --> 01:15:51,320
Whoa, what's up with you?

1634
01:15:51,553 --> 01:15:53,821
I don't know! Uh...

1635
01:15:53,823 --> 01:15:56,924
Maybe it could be the bisexual threeway
assault that just happened to me

1636
01:15:56,926 --> 01:15:58,294
with the mouth-fingering.

1637
01:15:59,628 --> 01:16:01,795
Or maybe it's the shot of a
fucking goldfish I had to drink.

1638
01:16:01,797 --> 01:16:03,466
- Chill out, dude.
- Don't tell me to chill out.

1639
01:16:04,132 --> 01:16:05,001
And why don't you grow up?

1640
01:16:06,302 --> 01:16:08,238
You're 26
and you still act like a kid.

1641
01:16:09,337 --> 01:16:10,473
Anyway, I don't care.

1642
01:16:11,073 --> 01:16:13,974
Just bang the cat already, mate.
I'm over it.

1643
01:16:13,976 --> 01:16:16,977
Yeah, just bang your
fucking cat, you bitch.

1644
01:16:16,979 --> 01:16:18,414
[groans]
Oh! Oh!

1645
01:16:19,015 --> 01:16:21,148
Bang the fucking cat,
you motherfucker!

1646
01:16:21,150 --> 01:16:22,886
Don't you fucking touch him!

1647
01:16:23,351 --> 01:16:25,585
Oh, hold... That's cool.
That's cool. That's cool.

1648
01:16:25,587 --> 01:16:27,188
- [shouts, laughs]
- [groans]

1649
01:16:27,190 --> 01:16:28,421
And down he goes.

1650
01:16:28,423 --> 01:16:30,424
For the one
and a two and a three!

1651
01:16:30,426 --> 01:16:32,526
Baby, you see that shit?

1652
01:16:32,528 --> 01:16:34,594
Oh! Oh! Oh! Ohh!

1653
01:16:34,596 --> 01:16:36,132
Hey, you get off my brother.

1654
01:16:37,165 --> 01:16:39,034
Motherfucker! What?

1655
01:16:40,302 --> 01:16:42,036
I'm sorry.
There's no need for violence.

1656

[Eric] Bitch!

1659
01:16:47,209 --> 01:16:48,043
You bitch!

1660
01:16:49,110 --> 01:16:50,546
Son of a bitch!

1661
01:16:52,448 --> 01:16:53,283
[man] Hey!

1662
01:16:55,016 --> 01:16:56,218
Get off me!

1663
01:16:58,186 --> 01:17:00,189
- [Elliot] Sorry!
- [Eric] Hey, it's a sperm whale.

1664
01:17:00,455 --> 01:17:01,423
- [yelps]
- [all jeering]

1665

01:17:05,461 --> 01:17:06,594
- Fuck! Oh, God.
- [man] Yeah!

1667
01:17:06,596 --> 01:17:08,031
[Eric]
Motherfucker!

1668
01:17:08,431 --> 01:17:09,630
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1669
01:17:09,632 --> 01:17:11,564
I think you broke my nose,
you fuck!

1670
01:17:11,566 --> 01:17:12,569
- Am I bleeding?
- [man] You all right, dude?

1671
01:17:15,171 --> 01:17:16,173
Little bitch!

1672
01:17:16,538 --> 01:17:17,573
Fucking pussy bitch.

1673
01:17:18,473 --> 01:17:19,874
[Joey shouts]

1674
01:17:19,876 --> 01:17:23,577
[dance music playing]

1675
01:17:23,579 --> 01:17:26,045
Let's go fuck shit up!

1676
01:17:26,047 --> 01:17:28,417
[all cheering]

1677
01:17:33,288 --> 01:17:35,054
Oh, my God, my balls!

[giggles]

'Cause he's a fucking
frat star, bro!

1682
01:17:53,508 --> 01:17:55,444
You are an animal, bro!
Animal!

1683
01:17:56,345 --> 01:17:57,379
[Elliot]
Congratulations.

1684
01:17:59,181 --> 01:18:01,948
Um. Go get me some brewskis
for me and my brothers.

1685
01:18:01,950 --> 01:18:02,551
Yes, sir.

1686

[groans, coughs]

1687
01:18:07,056 --> 01:18:08,357
Hey, we got a wedding to get to.

1688
01:18:13,061 --> 01:18:17,197
Ellie, darling.
I love your shirt.

1689
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:19,532
My little P-I-M-P.

1690
01:18:19,534 --> 01:18:20,568
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Hey, Seany, how are you?

1691
01:18:20,570 --> 01:18:22,973
- Guys, this is my mom.
- [Michaelson] Hey, hey.

1692
01:18:23,338 --> 01:18:25,639
- Hey, Jo-jo, I like the tattoo.
- Thanks, Dad.

1693
01:18:25,641 --> 01:18:28,075
You must be Refrigerator.

1694
01:18:28,077 --> 01:18:29,111
Yes, milady.

1695
01:18:29,611 --> 01:18:30,881
Is that Princess?

1696
01:18:31,146 --> 01:18:33,617
Oh, hey! I've been looking
for Princess!

1697
01:18:34,650 --> 01:18:37,518
Why don't you take a look at the
new queen of the Davis household.

1698
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:38,488
[meows]

1699
01:18:39,154 --> 01:18:40,923
- You are.
- Yeah.

1700
01:18:43,693 --> 01:18:45,494
[Elliot] That's going to take
some getting used to.

1701
01:18:46,028 --> 01:18:47,664
Oh, hey, El. Listen...

1702
01:18:48,596 --> 01:18:51,967
I taped the English
football game.

1703
01:18:52,534 --> 01:18:54,203
Maybe you and I could
look at it later.

1704
01:18:54,537 --> 01:18:56,338
Uh... I don't really like football.
Thanks.

1705
01:18:58,373 --> 01:18:59,208
[mutters]

1706
01:19:08,016 --> 01:19:08,984
God, you're hot.
