to relieve herself.

- Yeah, number two.

Is there a way
that I can release her

get her jumpsuit down?

I, uh, drank three bottles

Thank you so much. I feel
so much better already.

rock bottom. So, uh..

I would offer

1028
00:49:36,518 --> 00:49:40,728
Uh, well,
I, I got your number.

1029
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:41,771
- I'm gonna hang up now.
- I'm gonna hang up now.

1030
00:49:41,773 --> 00:49:42,981
Okay. Alright, well..

1031
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:47,318
We should... we should
do this some other time.

We should get together,
alright?

Yeah. Thank you
for the... electricity.

- Of course.
- I'm gonna go.

1035
00:49:55,786 --> 00:49:58,080
- Okay.
- But thank you.

1036

Absolutely. Call..
You got my number.

00:50:05,463 --> 00:50:06,965
Okay.

Whoopie! Ha-ha.

Miss Stevens!
Where have you been, huh?

1044
00:50:30,612 --> 00:50:33,322
I'm taking you upstate.

1045
00:50:33,324 --> 00:50:35,115
And you're gonna be there
for a long time

1046
00:50:35,117 --> 00:50:38,202
so I really hope that your little
trip to the vet was worth it.

1047

Oh, it was worth it.

Oh, sister,

1049
00:50:41,248 --> 00:50:45,251
Yeah, good.
I hope he de-flea'd you.

1050
00:50:45,253 --> 00:50:46,171
Go!

1051

Bye, Dennis.

1052

Oh, you are certifiable

1055
00:50:58,307 --> 00:50:59,891
I am getting on a train
with you right now.

1056
00:50:59,893 --> 00:51:02,267
I... I... I am getting on a
train, but you are going

1057
00:51:02,269 --> 00:51:03,769
back upstate where you belong.
You are in...

1058
00:51:03,771 --> 00:51:06,521
No, we gotta go out to the island.
We gotta go see my mother.

1059
00:51:06,523 --> 00:51:07,565
- I'm in trouble?
- Yeah.

1060
00:51:07,567 --> 00:51:09,191
- What about you?
- What about me?

1061
00:51:09,193 --> 00:51:11,485
What happened. You wanna make warden...
warden look bad

1062
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:13,195
for God's sake? I know.

1063
00:51:13,197 --> 00:51:15,947
I'll tell you what we do, I'll
tell you what we do, alright?

1064

Here I am,
I'm in your custody.

1065

We go out,
say goodbye to mom

1066
00:51:20,163 --> 00:51:22,621
and get me back in time
for Sunday lock-up.

Won't you just, shh?

1069
00:51:30,172 --> 00:51:32,340
Just shut your mouth
and stop talking, okay?

1070
00:51:32,342 --> 00:51:33,758
I don't wanna hear
you speak!

1132
00:55:54,978 --> 00:55:59,106
For you
to live your life

any way it pleases you.

She's a lovely,
sweet, young woman.

1143
00:56:32,141 --> 00:56:34,643
I don't want you
to disrupt her life.

she's lovely.

Nothing.

What in the hell
is goin' on?

1346

You know, your phone was
goin' straight to voicemail?

1347
01:13:45,591 --> 01:13:46,840
And I hear
you rented a car?

That's not in the budget!

Alright, sir, there is a
very good explanation.

Oh, she's got a very good

Please tell me
your goddamn explanation.

There was a problem
this morning.

What? With the prisoner?

With the train.

1356
01:14:03,234 --> 01:14:05,067
There was a three hour delay
and I didn't wanna risk it

1357
01:14:05,069 --> 01:14:07,402
so I thought it'd best
just to rent a car.

1358
01:14:07,404 --> 01:14:08,987
As for my phone,
there were some issues

Speak, Anderson.

1362

Uh, well, I would
just like to say

1363
01:14:17,122 --> 01:14:22,669
that in spite of all the unbelievable
travel snafus we came upon

1364
01:14:22,671 --> 01:14:27,423
it was, in fact, Officer Stevens'
single-minded determination

1365
01:14:27,425 --> 01:14:30,677
that got me to my mother's
bedside before she passed.

1366
01:14:30,679 --> 01:14:34,472
And I know her gratitude
was absolutely expressed

1367
01:14:34,474 --> 01:14:36,432
to her very good friend,
the governor.

1369

Stevens, you did good.

1370
01:14:43,649 --> 01:14:47,026
I want you to come in to fill out some
paperwork for a full time position.

I have my own family.

gonna get my fair share.

I will help out with moms with
you, but not instead of you

1406
01:16:53,529 --> 01:16:54,861
because what I will not do

1407
01:16:54,863 --> 01:16:56,196
is I will not give up
my life.

I have a life, but I do.

that you can live yours. Okay?

as best as I can.

- But I am a grown woman.
- I know.

Which means, I have to live
my life for myself, okay?

- Not just for you.

answer her phone?
