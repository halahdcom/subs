Housekeeping!

37
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:50,694
Arm yourselves, gentlemen.

38
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:01,788
Okay, this is the last time
I'm gonna say it, and then I'll drop it.

39
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:04,082
But what about my jeans club idea?

40
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:06,168
Right? Twenty dollars a month

41
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:09,129
for access to over 10,000 pairs of jeans?

42
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,255
Who wouldn't buy that?

43
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:12,883
Well, almost everybody we asked about it.
Right?

44
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,426
What about my hot-tutor idea?

45
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:18,096
Kids would study harder
if their tutor was really hot, right?

46
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,849
We just needed to build up
our... our stable of tutoresses.

47
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:23,685
Yeah, well, maybe when you called them
a "stable of tutoresses"

48
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:26,396
on the Craigslisting...
that was a bad idea.

49
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,023
We could come up with other names.

50
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,359
The whole point
is that it's a weird concept

51
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:33,695
to hire women
to take off their clothes for children.

52
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,824
Why am I coming up with the ideas, right?
I'm not the idea guy.

53
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:40,118
Darren, that's you. You're the idea guy.

54
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:41,787
I'm the "why." You're the "what."

55
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,205
Baby Dunc, you're the "how."

56
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,999
So let's put it
into high gear right now, baby.

57
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,918
Why? Because our lives suck.

58
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:51,046
I did my part.
What are we gonna do about it, Darren?

59
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,714
And how are we gonna do it, Baby Dunc?

60
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,383
Let's go! Let's freakin'...

61
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:57,969
...put it into high gear.

62
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:00,722
Yeah, let's kick it into high gear.
Sell me some salvia.

63
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:02,641
- I'm about to get high.
- Darren.

64
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,060
Darren, you're a drug addict.
And I'm here to help.

65
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,938
- I got you. There you go.
- Thank you, baby.

66
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,272
Enjoy that.

67
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:10,996
- Ooh.
- What the hell are you doing, man?

68
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,901
I'm a hustler. "I'm a... I'm a hustler."

69
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,570
I'm basically the Rick Ross
of our friendship tripod.

70
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:16,822
What's the big deal?

71
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,657
Weed does not do the trick anymore.

72
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,575
- This stuff does.
- Really great.

73
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:22,661
I'm not gonna become the mom
from Moonlight.

74
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,038
Yeah, no.
I know what that movie's about.

75
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:26,957
I steered clear of that one.

76
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,876
I'm more of a La La Land guy.

77
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,961
La-la boy.

78
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,007
Bye-bye.

79
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,885
Latro.

80
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:42,931
- Gonna start tweakin'.
- Yeah.

81
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,517
He's gonna start tweakin'!

82
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,770
Oh, my God.
Look at the size of this dude's load!

83
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,105
- What?
- Look at this thing!

84
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,208
Don't touch it.

85
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,918
That's a heavy hitter.

86
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,068
Whoa. Yeah, no.

87
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,945
It's like Nickelodeon Gak.

88
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,366
- The consistency's thick, like flubber.
- Mm.

89
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,702
Rub some on our shoes,
see if we can play basketball.

90
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,872
I mean, his nut sack must be gigantoid.

91
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,749
- Yeah.
- Right? Just big old sack

92
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,752
- to produce that.
- I don't really wanna imagine

93
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,085
any nut sacks,

94
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:15,172
but I will say the only thing
that would make me blow a load that big

95
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,341
is a really hot babe, right? I am right?

96
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:21,386
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

97
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,388
I mean, look. They're everywhere, man.

98
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,182
There's one. There's one.

99
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,985
This guy's busting loads
all over this room.

100
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,310
That's what we should be doing.

101
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,270
We should be busting loads into condoms

102
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,355
or maybe even not into condoms
if she's tested.

103
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:37,235
He's chuggin' champagne
like a freakin' boss!

104
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:40,322
I'm over here... I'm holding on
to the poop side of this scrubber.

105
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,199
Sure, yes. I've heard all of this before.

106
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:46,369
We should be wearing diamonds,
collecting albino pythons, dating on Raya.

107
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,788
Raya?

108
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,206
We're not, okay? We're here.

109
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,249
This is our life.

110
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,920
That's still fizzy.
It's pretty good. You might want some.

111
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,838
- What was that?
- Oh, he's tweaking.

112
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:59,841
Here, here. Grab a condom.
Put it on his face. I'll take a picture.

113
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,719
Oh, you are a dog.

114
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:06,389
- That's what he gets.
- Oh, my God.

115
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,350
Ooh, we got the snakeskin.

116
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,560
- Don't do drugs.
- No!

117
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,229
- Okay.
- No!

118
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,356
- Put it on his face.
- Take the photo.

119
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,233
- Take the picture. Take a photo.
- No.

120
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,193
I will as soon as you put it on his face.

121
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,916
- I'm not going to. Just take the photo.
- Just put it on his face.

122
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,907
- He'll get an STD.
- All the ejac is inside of the condom.

123
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,492
Take the photo.

124
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,701
Grab it!

125
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,065
The outside, the woman...

126
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,972
she could have one, obviously.

127
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,790
- Well, she...
- Hey!

128
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:35,460
What's wrong with him?

129
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:36,544
- Yep. Darren!
- No!

130
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,129
- All right, just stop.
- Darren.

131
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,881
Okay. Joel, I got this. Come on.

132
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:41,925
You want some salvia? Huh?

133
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,802
Get the fuck out of my room.

134
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,178
Get out, maids.

135
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,097
We're not maids. We're housekeepers.

136
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,767
- Not even that hot.
- Yeah, dude, you're not even that hot.

137
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,490
I was talking about the chick, Baby Dunc.

138
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:54,229
Yeah, so was I.

139
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,648
It's 2018. You can call chicks dudes now.

140
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,024
- Okay.
- You can.

141
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,985
What the heck are you guys doing?

142
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:03,113
Hey, dude. See?

143
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:07,701
Is he high again?

144
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:09,953
No.

145
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,872
I don't think he's being truthful.
I have to call Mitch.

146
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,082
Wish you wouldn't.

147
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,185
- Don't do that!
- Hi, Mitch.

148
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,128
- It's Cassie.
- Don't do that to your boy.

149
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,797
- Jesus Christ.
- What?

150
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,299
Pick him up. Put him on the cart.

151
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,176
Come on, Darren.
Come on, come on.

152
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,678

155
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,684
<i>♪ Dollar-dollar bill, y'all ♪</i>

156
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,856
So they were yelling at hotel guests
and smoking dope.

157
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,107
- Is that right?
- Yes.

158
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,151
Yelling at guests, screaming obscenities.

159
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,237
Well, Tums... boys will be boys.

160
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:47,365
You still want that associate manager
promotion, don't you?

161
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,327
Well, honey,
tonight is your chance to prove it.

162
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,911
All right?

163
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,122
Hope you got your balls on, now.

164
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,459
No, I have...

165
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:01,004
uh, yes, I have giant, uh,
lady... lady parts

166
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,714
that hang like balls.

167
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,383
They're also called ovaries.
Those are inside.

168
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:08,887
Good, 'cause we have got a shit storm
of a party heading our way tonight.

169
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,472
Boys, I'm gonna need you working too.

170
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,223
Toni... what? Are you serious?

171
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:15,226
Corky! This is Mr. Ahmad.

172
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,939
He is the personal attaché
of the Bey of Tunisia.

173
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,483
Oh, like the butler from Fresh Prince?

174
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:22,442
Very neat.

175
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:25,463
- I'm far from a butler.
- Wonder what happened to that guy.

176
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,447
Oh, that dude's paid.
He's doing fine.

177
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,157
Bey Awadi. The rich dude from Instagram?

178
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,533
This is who we speak of.

179
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,035
Aw, I love that dude.

180
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,120
He takes all the pictures
with the hot models

181
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,664
and the guns and the hovercrafts,

182
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,832
and the hot models shooting guns
on hovercrafts.

183
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,335
Yeah, didn't he poop off the Eiffel Tower?

184
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,538
- Mm-mm, no.
- Yeah.

185
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,965
He paid a man $10,000
to poop off the Eiffel Tower.

186
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,841
That's what's up.

187
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,885
He pays dudes tons of money all the time

188
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,887
- to do, like, stupid shit.
- Wow.

189
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,263
- Dudes.
- What?

190
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:53,807
We should pitch him the...

191
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,019
We should... pitch in tonight.

192
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,230
At the party. And be a team player.

193
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:04,067
Also, I should mention, uh, no cameras.
That includes cell phones.

194
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:08,071
- Privacy... a great concern of the Bey.
- All right, copy that. Give them up, boys.

195
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,489
- What, now?
- Yeah.

196
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:13,702
Hashtag "right now." What is it
with you kids and the phones? Come on.

197
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,829
You'll get 'em back
at the end of the night.

198
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,082
Okay. Now...

199
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,293
you guys have some place to be?
I bet you do, huh?

200
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,838
So fucking get there!

201
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,174
Oh, hey!

202
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:30,468
Sack up now, Tums. Big night, right?

203
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:31,594
Yes!

204
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:34,556
I can't get in there.

205
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,434
I call her Tums
'cause she relieves my heartburn.

206
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,394
Always been a nickname guy,

207
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:42,814
even when I was back QB-ing at USC.

208
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,774
Our security team should be arriving soon.

209
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:45,858
Great.

210
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,736
Hey, wanna go for one?

211
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:48,820
- No.
- Blue.

212
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,239
- Forty-two! Hut, hut, hut, huh?
- What are we doing?

213
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,591
- Wanna go?
- I don't know what...

214
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,034
All right. Fuck it.

215
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,036
Oh!

216
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,704
Right in the numbers!

217
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:58,705
I still got it.

218
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,540
I'll race you down there. Come on!

219
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,966
<i>Don't be stingy, papi.</i>

220
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:16,097
- Kisses.
- You like that?

221
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,141
It's for you.

222
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:23,521
- Uh, I have to go.
<i>- Okay, bye. Bye, sexy.</i>

223
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,905
Hey. I'm Ray.

224
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:36,034
Mitch usually has me run security
for these special events.

225
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,204
Uh, but you look like
you know what you're doing.

226
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,749
I'm just here
for the payday, right?

227
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:43,917
That makes two of us.

228
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,585
Aah!

229
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,060
Donald, get linked up
with our offshore bank accounts

230
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,311
as soon as possible.

231
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,729
Well, you didn't bring me along

232
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:07,524
'cause I look like the black nerd
from Die Hard...

233
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,608
'cause I don't.

234
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,069
Roger, I'm sick of it.

235
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,738
We need to secure the building
and arm the exits

236
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:17,242
with our explosive triggers
before we can take control of the rooftop.

237
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:21,454
So until then,
consider yourselves "hotel security."

238
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:25,291
And once the Bey gives us
his account access codes

239
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,293
and Donald transfers the money...

240
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,254
we pull out.

241
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,757
Gentlemen... let's move.

242
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:36,136
Oh, and... someone get rid of the body.

243
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:41,933
You should grab his ankles.
You're good at that.

244
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:45,603
- Fuck off, fag.
- Ooh.

245
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:56,281
You'd seriously wanna pitch
the Bey of Tunisia

246
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,644
one of our million-dollar ideas?

247
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,659
- Yeah.
- If we're pitching an idea...

248
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,120
- We're pitching!
- What are we pitching?

249
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,373
We could go
with my jeans club idea.

250
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,332
Hot tutors.

251
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,419
Medieval Times:
breakfast, lunch, and tournament?

252
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,755
I don't ever wanna hear
about Medieval Times BLT ever again.

253
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,382
Okay, they only do dinner.

254
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,968
We would do breakfast and lunch.
That's two more meals!

255
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:20,054
We would totally knock 'em out
of the medieval dining space.

256
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,264
Oh, that's a huge market.

257
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,434
Okay, you guys have good ideas?
I wanna hear 'em. I'm excited to hear 'em.

258
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,477
I feel like I'm the only one

259
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,229
crushing ideas out the gate.

260
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,399
Skintendo Joysuit?

261
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,985
Uh, what? No. Baby Dunc...

262
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,279
Yeah, we're going Skintendo. I like it.

263
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,032
All right, you know what?
I hate to be this guy,

264
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:41,534
but that dude's not gonna invest
in Skintendo.

265
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,202
Not in a million Willenniums.

266
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,539
So, it's like that?

267
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:50,501
We finally have a shot

268
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:53,922
to fulfill our childhood dreams

269
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:57,216
and you guys wanna let it float on past?

270
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,970
It's... like... dat?

271
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,850
I don't know about you,

272
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,936
but I don't wanna be picking up
nut-stuffed condoms

273
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:11,022
for the rest of my life without knowing
what type of sex they had with it.

274
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,024
Was it missionary? Was it doggy?

275
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,610
Was it doggy butt? Was it side-style butt?
I don't know.

276
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:20,573
Yeah, Alexxx, we all wanna know
how people are fucking each other, okay?

277
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,075
- Obviously.
- It's obvious.

278
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,558
- Mostly all I think about.
- Yeah, I mean, I can keep going.

279
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,579
- Cowgirl, reverse cowgirl.
- Plow-girl.

280
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,498
- Where you take the legs and you...
- Yeah.

281
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,541
I'm just saying,
we don't have the Joysuit.

282
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,044
Right? There's no screen
to play Lumber Jackson.

283
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,170
- Right.
- Okay.

284
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:37,006
You ready? Okay, you're the QB.
You're the running back.

285
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,549
Giving you the ball. Run with it.

286
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:41,386
You need to write down
all the technical mumbo jumbo

287
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,471
so the Bey understands what this thing is.

288
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:44,973
- Right?
- That's a lot of work.

289
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,225
Darren, I'm gonna get you markers,
a poster board.

290
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,060
You're gonna draw Lumber Jackson

291
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:52,063
so beautifully... muscles just popping.

292
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,649
Shredded, baby!

293
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,902
And you're gonna draw the Skintendo.
Right? The whole Joysuit.

294
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,697
Make it look pretty, and then I'm gonna
pitch that motherfucker.

295
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,825
- Okay.
- Dollar-dollar bills, y'all.

296
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,327
Boom! Put it in.

297
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:07,912
Dew'd Crew in full effect!

298
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:12,291
Finally fulfilling our destiny
of being childhood billionaires.

299
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,501
Let's do it! Hands in.

300
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,712
Everybody put your hands in.
Hands in.

301
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,880
Put your fist in. Put your fist in.

302
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,716
Dew'd Crew!

303
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,759
- I fucking love you guys. I'm so excited.
- Okay.

304
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,012
- Yes! I'll go get supplies.
- All right.

305
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:27,056
Yeah, just, uh, go get
those markers, man. Sick.

306
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,349
What the fuck was that?

307
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:29,642
What?

308
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,561
I mean, c-come on.
He's gonna pitch something.

309
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,937
It might as well be Skintendo.

310
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,439
Listen, dum-dum.

311
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,399
We can't pitch any of the upgrades.

312
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:40,028
We can't pitch the wireless connectivity,
the friend-controller mode.

313
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:43,072
Because if we do, Alexxx is gonna know

314
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,366
that we've been
working on Skintendo without him.

315
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,160
I'm just sick of working here, all right?

316
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:48,995
We should've told him from the beginning.

317
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,078
No, no. What?

318
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,165
He would've turned it
into some moneymaking idea,

319
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,208
and that's not what it is to us. Right?

320
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,353
- Right.
- And we're not gonna tell him now,

321
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,129
'cause he'll probably just...

322
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,214
kill himself. Or someone. I don't know.

323
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:03,760
I can just see him going into a rage
and... biting people. Children.

324
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,179
Bitten children. Blood on your hands.

325
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,638
Fine.

326
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:10,475
So we pitch Bey, he laughs us off,

327
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:14,729
and we go back to working on the idea...
together, secretly.

328
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,524
The fuck is that?

329
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:21,069
- It's a vape pen, Baby Dunc.
- Okay.

330
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:23,363
Well, you look like a tool
smoking that thing.

331
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,782
Well, I'm not "smoking" it.

332
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,116
I'm vaping it.

333
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,457
Ah, these your boys?

334
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,710
I believe so. Mr. Drothers.

335
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:41,464
- Mr. Ahmad. We, uh, spoke over the phone.
- Please. Conrad.

336
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:45,551
- This is Donald. This is Erma.
- You brought your girlfriend, huh?

337
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,053
I'm not his girlfriend.

338
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,221
Noted.

339
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,308
So did you guys, uh, meet up with Ray?

340
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,227
Ray isn't going to make it.

341
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,480
But I assure you, he briefed me.
Thoroughly.

342
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,818
Okay, Conrad.

343
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,154
If Ray briefed you so thoroughly...

344
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,866
...he left out the most important detail
of the evening.

345
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,291
No hats.

346
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,838
No hats. I guess the Bey likes
to be the only guy wearing a hat.

347
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,465
Which I get, you know,
'cause I'm a hat guy myself.

348
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:27,593
But, uh... really, love the Kangol, but...

349
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,595
Maybe call you Kangol-roo.

350
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,719
Uh...

351
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,057
Kangol-roo, huh? How about that?

352
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,767
Come on. Let's go have a party, huh?

353
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:35,977
Let's have some fun.

354
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,980
I'm gonna dance with you tonight, my dear.

355
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:45,361
<i>♪ Have a word for your brother ♪</i>

356
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,656
<i>♪ Have some time for one another ♪</i>

357
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,826
<i>♪ Really love one another ♪</i>

358
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,620
<i>♪ It's so hard to find ♪</i>

359
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,957
<i>♪ Have a word for your brother... ♪</i>

360
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,292
Whoo!

361
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,836
Catch me, dudes!

362
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,338
<i>♪ Really love one another... ♪</i>

363
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:07,550
Yeah, so I met Bey...
uh, he was doing a TED Talk

364
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,136
in Vegas... on being 'bout it.

365
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,889
We had a moment,
and now we're good friends.

366
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,976
Well, we're not good friends, actually.
I w... I would say... acquaintances.

367
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,299
You know what?
I'm hoping to meet him tonight.

368
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,272
Keep your eyes peeled.
The Bey's somewhere here.

369
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,733
Whoa! Oh!
Action Bronson right over here.

370
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:27,111
Excuse me, Mr. Bronson.
Can I interest you in a pulled pork...

371
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:28,988
barbecue quesadilla...

372
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,115
with corn relish.

373
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,538
Fuck, that's fuckin' delicious, man.

374
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,457
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

375
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,335
- He spit it out but said it was delicious.
- Yes.

376
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,421
Maybe he's watching his calorie intake.
He is wearing athletic wear.

377
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,006
Ho-ly shit.

378
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,840
There he is...

379
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,467
the Bey.

380
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,096
Oh, my God, he is the man.

381
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:57,433
Even his little dog
has 100,000 followers.

382
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,018
- Wow.
- Yeah, I don't know,

383
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,686
it looks like he's having fun.

384
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,855
We should probably
just let him do his thang.

385
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:05,775
Maybe we, uh, hang in the cut?
You know, have him come to us?

386
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,527
"The cut"? There's no cut.

387
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,362
Action's in the cut.

388
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,322
We're not gonna be in the cut if...
whatever.

389
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,698
Let's go. It's game time.

390
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,326
Hey, yo, I had this pet hyena once, right?

391
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,744
Then that motherfucker died. Ehh!

392
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,621
More appeteezees for the Bey.

393
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,666
Then I had that motherfucker stuffed,
put a Fleshlight in back,

394
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,709
and then I fucked the shit out that bitch.

395
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:26,712
It's like necrophilia
and bestiality in one.

396
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,506
It's hilarious!

397
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,883
That is hilarious.

398
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,718
Pulled pork quesadilla...

399
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:35,763
- with a corn relish, anyone?
- Yo.

400
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:38,266
That sounds bomb as fyuck right now.

401
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:39,684
Throw one into my open mouth.

402
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:40,827
- Really?
- Yeah, bro.

403
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,436
- Okay.
- Ah...

404
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,148
- Oh, I nailed it!
- Make it rain!

405
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,400
- Makin' it rain!
- Come on!

406
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:51,904
Oh, that shit was dope.
I'm covered in grease, baby.

407
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,864
- Yo, you're my dude.
- Thank you so much.

408
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:55,783
And this shit is on punto.

409
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,368
Hey, um...

410
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,911
Bey-Bey, may I ask you a question?

411
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,372
- What that, bro?
- Do you like black people?

412
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,960
Because Lumber Jackson is the first

413
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:09,005
full-body-controlled
blaxploitation video game ever.

414
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,966
Now, using our revolutionary
Skintendo Joysuit technology...

415
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,343
Excuse me. Step away immediately.

416
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,304
Yo, Ahmad, chill the fuck out, bro.

417
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:18,097
I'm trying to listen to the man.

418
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,700
- Thank you.
- I'm chilled out.

419
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,934
I arranged this chilled-out party.

420
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,477
I got Shaggy to perform.

421
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:24,478
Uh, Shaggy?

422
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:27,273
Man, busted-ass Shaggy
ain't performing shit, a'ight?

423
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,317
And put that dusty-ass BlackBerry away.

424
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,777
This primitive-ass,
prehistoric motherfucker.

425
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:34,739
I'm sorry, guys, 2018,
this dude ain't got a touch screen?

426
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:35,906
You big fucking tree.

427
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,658
Goddamn.

428
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:39,160
What a bitch-ass.

429
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,370
- He's just a butler.
- Yeah, you suck.

430
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,331
Yeah, you got low self-esteem.
Fuck off, bro.

431
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:45,625
Anyway, you were saying, my dude?

432
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,918
That suit controls
that video game character?

433
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,253
- Yes, actually.
- Oh, yeah.

434
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,797
- And here...
- Yeah, this is the schematics right here.

435
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,424
You know, I built it, programmed it.

436
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,092
Oh, my God.

437
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:57,720
Bro, please approach us
and just unzip your trousers

438
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,847
and pull that dick out
so we could just see

439
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,850
what the penis head of a genius
really looks like.

440
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,661
- Know what I'm saying?
- Pull your dick out.

441
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,146
Well, to be honest, uh,
it would be my penis head pulled out.

442
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,649
I'm the genius that came up
with the whole concept, the idea.

443
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:10,983
I'm not gonna pull my dick out.

444
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,693
Oh, okay.
That's a cute little cartoon,

445
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,195
but did you build the motherfucker?

446
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,614
- Yeah, no, we have.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, we built it.

447
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,532
And there's actually
some new features too,

448
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:19,950
like, uh, friend-control mode,

449
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:23,371
where, uh, you can actually control
the person wearing the Skintendo Joysuit.

450
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:25,498
It's... it's revolutionary.

451
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,292
Damn. Oh, yo, yo,
I'm gonna need, like, three of those

452
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:30,503
for, like, blap, blap, blap.
You know what I'm saying?

453
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,005
'Cause I love fucking white women.
Makes me feel powerful,

454
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,249
especially if I can control them,
you know what I mean?

455
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:39,804
Yes! I forgot about friend-control mode.
But you know who didn't forget about it?

456
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:43,099
Sony and Microsoft
when we pitched them this idea.

457
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,851
And they were super into it.
But you know what I said to them?

458
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,311
Fuck y'all!

459
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,772
'Cause the Dew'd Crew
wants to do business with the Bey.

460
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,982
The Dew'd Crew? Wait, wait, wait.
Time-out, time-out.

461
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:53,651
'Cause y'all drink mad Mountain Dew?

462
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:54,819
You got it!

463
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,195
Yes, that's exactly right.

464
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,321
- How did you...
- Wow.

465
00:19:57,405 --> 00:20:01,409
Yo, motherfucker, me too! Holy shit, dude!

466
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:04,578
- You ever fuck with Baja Blast?
- Oh, you know I do. You know I do!

467
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:05,764
- So good.
- Ah, man...

468
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:07,623
- Code Red over here!
- This is Code Red boy.

469
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:08,874
Fuck, I love you guys!

470
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,544
Let's talk numbers.
How much money we talking about?

471
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,671
Bey Awadi. Sorry, this... this feels like

472
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:16,549
just the sort of frivolous investment
we spoke about not partaking in.

473
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:21,053
My dude, just because you told me not to,
why don't you "par-take" my checkbook out

474
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:24,306
and then write these motherfuckers
a check

475
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,518
for 200-frivolous-fucking-thousand-dollars

476
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,855
so they can chase their goddamn dreams?
Am I right? Yezzir.

477
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,778
Oh, and then please scrub out
my hyena's pussy,

478
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,650
'cause I'm trying to fuck that shit later.

479
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,193
You should fuck it.

480
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:37,653
Treat yo'self. Oh, my God!

481
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,029
Cool. Get the fuck out of here.

482
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:41,216
- Oh, my God. Yeah. Okay.
- Go. Get out, get out.

483
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,825
We'll talk more numbers later.

484
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,160
- Thank you.
- Bye, take care.

485
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,121
All right, y'all.
I'm spending paper tonight.

486
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,524
It's just the beginning!

487
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,249
Not happening.

488
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,919
Apologies, Corky.
Let's go, boys. Let's go.

489
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,463
Let's go!

490
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:58,883
Cassie! Cassie! Tums!

491
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:00,801
Tums, meet me at the elevator.

492
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,386
- Come on, boys.
- But our check.

493
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,771
- Fuck off.
- Yeah, I was just...

494
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:14,815
Yeah, we're going.

495
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:18,319
- Get up. Get out of here.
- Ow. Goddamn.

496
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:25,951
These three idiots just tried to sell
a goddamn video game to the Bey!

497
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:27,536
I thought I told you to sack up!

498
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,872
I'm sorry. I didn't...

499
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,541
You didn't...
you didn't want that promotion?

500
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,335
Yeah, you made that pretty clear.

501
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,213
Boys! You're fired.

502
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,465
- Yeah.
- No fucking way, Mitch.

503
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,466
He was assaulted.

504
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,426
Out! Out you go!

505
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,221
- We're going.
- Cassie...

506
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:49,475
- ...get back to work.
- Yes, sir.

507
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:56,607
That's quite a stiff arm
you got there, huh?

508
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,402
You all right? Huh?
That paw of yours need a little ice?

509
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:04,657
- My hand is fine.
- Ah.

510
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,201
Well, how about a little ice
for those nipples, huh?

511
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,624
Oh-ho-ho-ho.

512
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,084
Yeah, you like that, huh?

513
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:16,752
Oh, that's hot.

514
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,380
Oh, that is hot, lady.

515
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,798
You wanna play?

516
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,591
- I do.
- Okay.

517
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:25,469
- Oh, I knew it. Oh.
- What about this?

518
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:27,555
- Yeah. Ooh.
- Mm.

519
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:29,682
Speaking of stiff...

520
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:36,063
Not my pecker!

521
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,150
Whoopsie-daisy.

522
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:42,528
All I'm saying is,

523
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,863
you win some, you lose some.

524
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:48,492
The key to our jiggy fuckin' lifestyle
is tucked in that butler's pocket.

525
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,078
My name is Alexxx with three Xs.

526
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:55,874
I'm about to go explosive
on these motherfuckers!

527
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,586
Three X means "poison," by the way.

528
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:01,797
- Uh, it's also a Vin Diesel movie.
- Shut the fuck up.

529
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,799
Yeah, well, it's also
spicy barbecue sauce.

530
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,510
But I think we all know
I meant it in the explicit fashion!

531
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,600
My darling, have you lost
your fucking mind?

532
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,228
Get him out of here. If they see him
before we secure the build...

533
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:25,696
Lock down all exits.

534
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,824
<i>We have three waiters on the run
and they know.</i>

535
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,951
<i>Donald, it's time.</i>

536
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,536
Copy that.

537
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:38,334
Hey, fellas. Bey Awadi's security here.
We just have one question.

538
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,501
What's your question?

539
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:42,171
- Do you wanna die?
- What?

540
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,342
Whoa, hey, hey.

541
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:04,818
What, y'all don't pack a lunch?

542
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:07,029
Man, take these clowns up to the roof
with the rest.

543
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,572
- Okay.
- Let's go.

544
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:09,490
Easy, man.

545
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,116
Locking down perimeter now.

546
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,328
<i>Attention, all units.
</i>Operation Trespass begins now.

547
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,333
Sweep the hotel.

548
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:19,375
Lock and arm all exits
with breach sensors.

549
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,001
We are taking over.

550
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:23,212
- Move! Get down, stay down.
- Hey, everybody be calm!

551
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,589
Just do what they say.
Everything's gonna be okay.

552
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:27,299
Right? Right?

553
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:30,094
Oh!

554
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:33,347
Oh! Oh, shit! Oh, fuck!

555
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,391
Shit. Fuck.

556
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:39,019
Yo, what the fuck, man?
You're supposed to be guarding the party.

557
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:40,646
Party's over.

558
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,658
Darren,
stop vaping, all right?

559
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,327
- I can't breathe!
- Just shut up! Okay?

560
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:57,287
As these doors open,
they're gonna be waiting,

561
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:59,248
ready to cut cocks.

562
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,542
We'll hide. Hide in the shaft.

563
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,544
- Here, just help me up. Help me up.
- What?

564
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:06,588
- Ow. Just... what are you doing?
- Oh... oh!

565
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,132
- I found the latch.
- Oh, seriously?

566
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,895
- I think I found it.
- Well, go... get in.

567
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,055
Shit.

568
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,474
They climbed into the elevator shaft.

569
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:20,310
They could be anywhere.
Keep your eyes open.

570
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,422
Gotta just get the thing...

571
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:33,574
- You said you found a latch.
- No, I said I think I found a latch.

572
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,200
Shut up, Baby Dunc.

573
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:36,284
Whoa.

574
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:37,703
No one's there.

575
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:39,872
Follow me.

576
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,833
Wait, I think we should turn ourselves in.

577
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:43,917
What? No. Go!

578
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,753
Not turning ourselves in.
That's pussy shit.

579
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:47,196
They might appreciate the gesture.

580
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:50,134
Yeah, and they might cut our dicks off.
We gotta get out and go for help.

581
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,509
We're not gonna go for help.
Slide down this rail.

582
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:53,927
- It'll be badass.
- What?

583
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:55,304
Yeah.

584
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:58,932
Oh! Oh, shit.

585
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:02,102
- I need help.
- That was not badass. Come on!

586
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:09,693
All exits confirmed as locked.

587
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:11,528
No sign of the waiters.

588
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:17,326
They locked the doors
and we don't have our phones!

589
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,369
- We're screwed!
- No shit, Baby Dunc.

590
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:21,496
We gotta get a landline.

591
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:29,505
Clear.

592
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:35,052
- I got two.
- Quick, take 'em up with the rest.

593
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:36,804
<i>Ándale, bitch.</i>

594
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,685
Let's move.

595
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,067
Tie them together.

596
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,820
One collar per group.

597
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:55,739
Now, listen up... if you want to live.

598
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:57,908
These collars are linked to sensors

599
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:02,579
that we have placed
at every entrance of this building.

600
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:06,917
Anyone who attempts to enter or exit,

601
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:08,919
they detonate.

602
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,088
It's fucked up, right?

603
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,382
- You missed me.
- Collect their cell phones

604
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,300
if they still have them.

605
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:18,053
And if they try anything funny, well...

606
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:23,058
...refrain from killing anyone
unless I tell you.

607
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,351
We're not here to murder.

608
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,395
We're here to collect a toll
from Bey Awadi

609
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,981
for trespassing on American soil.

610
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,275
You ain't touching my stacks, bro.

611
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:32,776
Really?

612
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,820
"In case of threat of violence
or act of terror,

613
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:37,239
please do not challenge
or defy assailants.

614
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,074
Comply with their demands at all times."

615
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:41,160
Did you read that in the manual
or something?

616
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:42,578
No.

617
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,288
Well, yes, but... who cares?

618
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,623
It gives me everything I need
to keep the hotel in order,

619
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:49,001
- no matter what.
- This lady just shit her pants.

620
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,669
Is that in the manual too?

621
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:54,089
I... I did... I did not shit my pants.

622
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,300
I just want to make that clear.

623
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,968
Are you calling me a liar?

624
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:00,804
No, I'm saying you're very smart
and you're picking up on something.

625
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:03,765
Maybe someone...
someone did shit their pants.

626
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:05,434
And I'm not gonna say who.

627
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:08,854
- But someone.
- Get her out of here.

628
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:12,107
- Yeah, get her out of here. Damn it.
- Get you out of here.

629
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,610
Oh, it's dripping.

630
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:15,903
And now it hit my anklet.

631
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:17,863
And my toe ring.

632
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,325
We are locked down, boss.

633
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:24,536
And I'm very close
to accessing the offshore accounts.

634
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,704
<i>I know, I know.</i>

635
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:28,040
"Close only counts
in horseshoes and hand grenades."

636
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,083
I wasn't gonna say that.

637
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:31,710
The phones are dead.

638
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,129
No Internet either. No Wi-Fi, no DSL.

639
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:37,382
Jesus, this guy has so many tabs open.
It's stressing me the fuck out.

640
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:39,551
Guys, they cut the lines.

641
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:40,928
It's what they do.

642
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:44,223
It's... what I'd do.

643
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:47,142
Hey, stop talking cool. Okay?

644
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:51,687
Clear.

645
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:58,862
Oh, my God. There's two guys
out there with guns.

646
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:00,906
- They're coming this way.
- That's it. I'm done.

647
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,283
Wait, what are you...
What's with the pockets?

648
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:05,494
- I'm showing them I'm unarmed.
- Shut up.

649
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,537
We can think of something.
We can take 'em.

650
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:09,039
Darren, just think of something.

651
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:11,041
I can't. I got nothing, man.

652
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:14,086
- I...
- Fine.

653
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:17,297
- What are you...
- I got an idea.

654
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:20,467
I haven't done this in a long time.

655
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:35,232
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

656
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:44,241
Whoa!

657
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,867
What the fuck?

658
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,121
Look at this freaky fuck.

659
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,665
Hey, Rich, come in here.
You gotta see this.

660
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:55,752
Jesus.

661
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:57,879
Rest in peace, you horny bastard.

662
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:01,985
What's your problem?

663
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:03,969
I just don't like the way
this job is going.

664
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,805
- Everything's falling apart.
- Ah. Hey, hey, hey.

665
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:10,142
By this time tomorrow,
we'll be sitting poolside

666
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:12,019
sipping Coronas in Cabo, right?

667
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,148
I just don't wanna see you getting hurt.

668
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,108
You're sweet.

669
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,152
I love you.

670
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:24,906
I love you too.

671
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,080
- Yeah.
- Real quick.

672
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:34,416
Okay, yeah.

673
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:53,894
Ew, right?

674
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:59,232
- Stop!
- Sorry. Hey.

675
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,360
Hmm?

676
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:05,113
You go around,
grab the corner of the sheet...

677
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:18,667
Psst!

678
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,764
Hit 'em with the lamp!

679
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,057
Wha...

680
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:40,649
Oh, I am so sorry. I am so sorry.

681
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,860
Are you all right?

682
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:47,322
Rich? Rich?

683
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:52,536
- Ow.
- Uh...

684
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:55,789
Oh! Freeze! Shit.

685
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:58,041
You just killed the man of my dreams.

686
00:31:58,125 --> 00:31:59,727
- Now you're gonna die.
- No, no.

687
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:03,171
He's just knocked out. Like the movie
<i>Friday. "He got knocked the fuck out!"</i>

688
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:13,557
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I killed him.

689
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,640
I'll be your boyfriend.

690
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,068
I didn't do it.

691
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:34,411
Baby Dunc, are you okay?

692
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:37,664
I think you killed him.

693
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,543
Sorry I didn't help,

694
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,713
but I got punched in the chest
really hard one time.

695
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:50,093
We killed the bad guys. My plan worked!

696
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:51,303
What... hey, stop it!

697
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,054
Your plan didn't work.
You got them horny

698
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:54,639
and got me 300 kicked in the chest.

699
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:56,224
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine!

700
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:58,560
We got these bitches
right where we want them.

701
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:01,188
- Now we gotta just go through their shit.
- Alexxx, no! No!

702
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:03,431
Leave their stuff alone.
You're gonna make them madder.

703
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:05,962
Baby Dunc, what are you talking about?
This is video games 101.

704
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:08,987
- You kill bad guys, you take their shit.
- It's true.

705
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,447
Like you never played video games.

706
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,240
- Go close the fucking door.
- Okay, yeah.

707
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,450
We got zip ties.

708
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,706
We got a fucking gun.
We got a big-ass knife.

709
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:22,584
By the way, I get next kill.
You guys are being total kill hogs...

710
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:29,090
- What did you do?
- Okay, and that is where the trigger is.

711
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:30,814
- Oh, my God.
- Now we know that.

712
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:32,469
I'm gonna go put on pants, so...

713
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:34,638
Oh, yeah, no. Good call, good call,

714
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:37,849
you're gonna wanna be fully clothed
when you fucking blow your head off, man!

715
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:39,851
Why are you getting dressed in the closet?

716
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:41,895
We've already seen
your dick, balls, and butthole.

717
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:45,106
- You guys saw my butthole?
- A lot.

718
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,776
- I haven't shaved in months.
- Okay, this is it.

719
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:51,029
I'm stressing out. Alexxx, get back here
and sell me salvia right now, man!

720
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:53,782
Yeah, Darren,
I'm not gonna sell you salvia right now

721
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:57,118
'cause we're kind of under attack
from terrorists.

722
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:59,922
Every time you open that, I see your dick.
We need to get outta here.

723
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:04,000
We need to get away from bad people.
We need to get help from good people.

724
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:07,337
If you wanna bail on the Bey
and the Skintendo Joysuit to go get help,

725
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,047
fine, we can do that.

726
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,924
But we gotta do it in a badass fashion,

727
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:13,176
or we're gonna look
like total fucking pussies.

728
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,553
We are pussies!

729
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:17,196
- We don't have to look like it, Baby Dunc!
- Don't call me that.

730
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:19,724
Darren, think of something dope
and badass to get us out.

731
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:22,227
- What?
- Baby Dunc, implement the thing

732
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,563
that Darren's about to think of. Go.

733
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:27,941
I'm not coming up with the plan, okay?

734
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:40,412
- Shit! I thought of something.
- What?

735
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:41,788
Is it something I can build?

736
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,624
- Yeah.
- Fuck.

737
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:46,835
Why do I have to be
so goddamn industrious?

738
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:50,422
Hey, guys?
If you guys thought my dick was small,

739
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,465
it's 'cause the AC
was really blasting earlier.

740
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:53,592
So that's the reason.

741
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:57,012
- It's super hot, right?
- It's very hot.

742
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,096
Alexxx, I...

743
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,682
you've got nothing to be ashamed of.

744
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:09,941
If you... don't pull too much on this one,
'cause then this one gets pulled.

745
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:14,070
What the fuck, man?

746
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:16,531
Eagle Eye has been watching you,
Bey Awadi.

747
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:19,951
The... the U.S. militia faction?
What do they want with him?

748
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:22,203
Sometimes the government's
politically correct hands

749
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:24,497
get tied in knots, forcing people
to protect their lands

750
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:26,291
from unwanted invasions.

751
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:27,917
"Invasions."

752
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,753
I'm not a fuckin' invader, bro.

753
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:32,464
I love America. I went to Florida State.

754
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:33,632
Peep the bill, bro.

755
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:35,717
I'm here to have fun, fuck,

756
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,636
drink, pop Molly.

757
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,262
What's more American than that, bro?

758
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:40,513
Money.

759
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:43,391
Five hundred million dollars
transferred into an offshore account.

760
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:46,895
Five hundred million?
You are crazy, Mr. Albino Bad Guy.

761
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,271
That's not gonna happen.

762
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:50,190
He doesn't have that kind of cash flow.

763
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,692
I-it's all tied up in assets, uh, bonds...

764
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:56,863
Does this free up some of those assets?

765
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,426
I get it.

766
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,451
This is a prank.
It's just kind of dark, man, like...

767
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,370
Knoxville, you can come out now!

768
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:06,206
No! Steve-O! Steve, you okay?

769
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:09,125
- Come on, man. We told you we can't.
- Th-th-there is a way.

770
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:11,753
Oh, dear.

771
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,839
An account a-access code.
Only, uh, he and his father have it.

772
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:16,508
What the fuck are you doing?

773
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,551
He's playing nice.

774
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:20,804
Now it's your turn.

775
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,723
I can't, okay?
If... if I give you those codes,

776
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:26,142
- my dad'll kill me, a'ight?
- What's its name?

777
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:28,645
Wh... what?

778
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:29,646
The dog.

779
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,314
The dog?

780
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:33,149
- Mm.
- Lil Puma.

781
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:34,734
Little Puma. Hi, pal.

782
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:37,445
Oh, that's a good boy.

783
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:38,905
Come to Uncle Conrad.

784
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,865
We have a couple
of those extra breach sensors.

785
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:42,659
Get them with a corresponding collar.

786
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,370
Be careful with his hip dysplasia, please.

787
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:48,581
Of course, of course.
You know, I love dogs. Big dogs, usually.

788
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:50,417
Little dogs not much, but this one

789
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,353
has a great personality.

790
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,254
No, no, no. What... what are you doing?

791
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:58,758
There you go, Lil Puma. Go get it, boy.

792
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,762
- Oh, thank you very much.
- Don't do it.

793
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:03,847
Puma, stay. Stay, Puma.

794
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,516
No!

795
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:12,230
Why is this thing beeping?

796
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:15,608
Oh, shit!

797
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:24,909
I must have given you the nine...
which was upside down.

798
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,245
That is my bad.

799
00:37:27,704 --> 00:37:29,998
The lesson still stands.

800
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:33,793
The account numbers,
or there will be more bloodshed.

801
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,213
Do it, Bey Awadi.

802
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,801
Okay. Okay, clear. Go.

803
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:43,136
- Ready?
- Yeah.

804
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:51,644
Zip-tie zip line. Baby Dunc, you genius.

805
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:54,439
Uh, it was my idea.
You know, I saw the scaffolding.

806
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:55,982
I said, "Home Alone-style zip line."

807
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:58,109
- Okay, it's fine. Good work.
- Thanks.

808
00:37:58,193 --> 00:38:02,489
Okay. Are you ready to be Tom Brady?
Because that's what's about to go down.

809
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:05,241
You're gonna become Tom Brady, Alexxx.

810
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:06,552
- Fuckin' Tom Brady, dog.
- Yes.

811
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:08,256
- Yeah, you're Tom Brady.
- Tom Brady, dog!

812
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,663
Yeah, you're Tom Brady.

813
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:13,583
Shh.

814
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:16,252
Here we go.

815
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,094
I'm Tom Brady!

816
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:26,888
- Tom Brady!
<i>- ♪ We the Brady Bunch ♪</i>

817
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,974
<i>- ♪ We the Brady Bunch ♪
- The what? What? Brady Bunch?</i>

818
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,560
Do you think Tom Brady
is in The Brady Bunch?

819
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,188
Yeah, it's the dad, right?

820
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,648
- No.
- No, he isn't.

821
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,191
Oh, I thought that's who we...

822
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:41,569
He was cool, though. He was really cool.
He had a hell of a... arm.

823
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:44,113
Okay, why don't you just show us
how my zip line works, Joel?

824
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:46,324
- Yeah.
- Right, right. Um...

825
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:50,578
Okay, so basically,
I rigged up this ironing board,

826
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,163
- like a harness.
- Right.

827
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,791
And then you kind of use it
like a hang glider. Okay...

828
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,060
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

829
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:57,627
Kevin McCallister would be proud.

830
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,920
Maybe even Tom Brady.

831
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,564
- Don't talk about Tom Brady.
- Who's he?

832
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,548
- Just don't talk about him.
- All right.

833
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,591
Quarterback.

834
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:05,301
Here's what we're gonna do.

835
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:08,596
We are gonna shoot rock, paper, scissors
to find out who goes first.

836
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,057
Okay, but no "two out of three" bullshit.

837
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,684
- Whoever wins wins.
- Right.

838
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:14,529
- Fair and square, right? Okay.
- Yes, yeah.

839
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:16,354
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

840
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,022
- Yes.
- Fuck!

841
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:19,983
- Thank God.
- Fuck!

842
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:22,110
Let's go again. Two out of three.
Let's be fair.

843
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,171
- What? You just said...
- No, do not do this, okay?

844
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,406
It could've happened to any of us,
just happened to you.

845
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:29,701
Yeah, maybe, or maybe hella long ago,
you guys were like,

846
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:33,538
"If we ever do rock, paper, scissors
with Alexxx, we should shoot paper."

847
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:37,625
Because two guys shooting paper,
that's suspect.

848
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:39,043
- I can't...
- Yeah.

849
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:40,967
Okay, just forget it.
Let's shoot again.

850
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,274
- What? No.
- Yes, thank you, Baby Dunc.

851
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:45,675
- How about, don't be a sore loser?
- Don't call me a loser.

852
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:47,260
Hey, guys, stop fighting.

853
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:48,928
We'll make a dummy and do a test run.

854
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:52,348
- We have a dummy right here.
- No, we'll just use one of the dead bo...

855
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,197
Oh, my God!

856
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:19,959
Oh, God!

857
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:26,466
A little help.

858
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:27,550
Help!

859
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,178
Oh, fuck.

860
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:39,604
Hey, give me half your Which Wich.

861
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,522
Well,
if I wanted to eat a half a sandwich,

862
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,316
I'd have brought half a sandwich, Chet.

863
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,692
Think you're pretty smart, huh?

864
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,569
You the one installing
a seven-layer firewall

865
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:49,697
to mask a $1/2-billion transaction
at the world's third-largest bank

866
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:52,116
using only your wife's tablet,
or is that me?

867
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,743
Oh, that's right. It's me.

868
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,250
- Way to go, Baby Dunc.
- Huh?

869
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:03,294
What? You... This is your plan!

870
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:05,755
No, I said, "Home Alone-style zip line."

871
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,507
This is Home Alone 3 at best.

872
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,070
We were supposed to look cool as shit
coming out of the window,

873
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,134
doing a badass exit.

874
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,304
Now we look like a bunch of losers
hanging up here.

875
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:14,472
Oh, God.

876
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:18,685
- What the fuck?
- The police!

877
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:19,936
Hey, we're up here!

878
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:22,522
Thank you so much. Thank you, God.

879
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:25,233
Police! Yeah! Holla! Hooty-hoo!

880
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:28,861
- Oh! Oh, shit.
- What the fuck?

881
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:31,197
- Oh, my God.
- What are you doing up there?

882
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,866
There are people in the hotel with guns!

883
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,660
- No!
- Shooting people!

884
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,370
- You're all fuckin' pigs!
- Get us down!

885
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:38,746
Fuck you, copper!

886
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,581
They're here to help us.

887
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:43,292
We're not gonna look cool as shit
getting saved by the LAPD.

888
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:44,919
Do you even listen to Kendrick Lamar?

889
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:46,838
Are there people up there with guns
or not?

890
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:48,563
Yes, there are! That is one right there!

891
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:50,751
He is a man with a gun.
He tried to cut off our dicks.

892
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,011
Oh, fuck you.
You wish I touched your dick.

893
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:55,054
We're coming up there.
What room number is that?

894
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:57,974
- Nine seventeen!
- We're coming up there now!

895
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,100
Don't fucking move.

896
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:06,691
LAPD. Open the door.

897
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,362
Are you aware you've got three waiters

898
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:13,239
hanging outside the ninth-floor window?

899
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:16,826
Sir, walking away from a cop
is a bad idea.

900
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:20,163
I will arrest you for obstruction.
Open the fucking door!

901
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,748
Shit.

902
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,210
Officer down! Officer down!

903
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:27,795
Hank, I need backup!

904
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:30,465
I got you, Danny. I'm calling for backup.
I'm coming right now.

905
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,383
- Stay there!
- No! No, no, no!

906
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:35,094
- Don't leave us up here.
- Guys, it's too late. Okay?

907
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:36,721
Let's wiggle our asses back in there,

908
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,848
kill some bad guys,
and get our fucking check back.

909
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,516
I'm not risking my life for the check.

910
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,769
Why not? It's our dreams, right?

911
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:46,647
No! The check is your dream.
My dream is just working on Skintendo.

912
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:47,857
But now you can!

913
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,860
And we are! Okay? We have been!

914
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,343
- Baby Dunc...
- Without you!

915
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,450
Oh, what the fuck?

916
00:42:58,785 --> 00:43:00,870
Band-Aids and butter beans! We're online.

917
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:04,207
Conrad, we're online.
Awaiting an access code.

918
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,002
Speak clearly.

919
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:10,671
And speak quickly.

920
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:13,633
Fuck. Fuck!

921
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,300
Fifty-three...

922
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:17,386
Twenty-two...

923
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,098
Zero two...

924
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:21,432
Zero two...

925
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:24,602
- Thirty-three...
- Thirty-three...

926
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:26,646
- Sixty-nine.
- Six-nine.

927
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:30,399
I want verbal confirmation
from you, Darren.

928
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:32,527
Are you working on the fucking game
without me?

929
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:34,152
Affirmative.

930
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:37,365
You motherfuckers!

931
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:40,159
I'm gonna wiggle us back in there,
you backstabbing bitches!

932
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:48,209
Sixty-nine, 420, 69.

933
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,211
- I'm serious!
- Sixty-nine, 69, 69.

934
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,294
Oh, shit!

935
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:57,593
What the fuck?

936
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:02,723
Conrad, hold on.

937
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:05,852
Shit.

938
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:07,061
We've had a breach.

939
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:08,855
Oh, God.

940
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:10,398
Sixth floor, security room.

941
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:12,900
What do you mean? Who... who is it?

942
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,236
Who the fuck are you? Huh?

943
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:17,697
Huh? You SWAT?

944
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:19,365
Are you SEALs?

945
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:20,867
Transporters?

946
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:24,829
Answer me right the fuck now,
or I'll plug you in three seconds.

947
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:25,912
Uh...

948
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:30,960
- One...
- No.

949
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:32,170
Please.

950
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,173
- Two...
- Please.

951
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:41,929
- No!
- No, no. Wait, wait, wait...

952
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:43,806
Three!

953
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,520
Oh, fuck.

954
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:51,522
Oh... oh, my God.

955
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:54,275
I'm a genius! I wiggled us back in.

956
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:57,445
Whoo!

957
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:00,281
<i>Donald, kill them
</i>and then enter the code.

958
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,033
<i>You do have the code, right, Donald?</i>

959
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:03,618
<i>Donald?</i>

960
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:04,785
Donald?

961
00:45:07,914 --> 00:45:09,832
There's a cop at the lobby door.
We shot him.

962
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:11,751
But he got away.

963
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,894
Why are you looking at me like that, huh?

964
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:18,633
You're the sneaky fucks.

965
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:21,093
The backstabbers,
the betrayers, the Judas...

966
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:22,345
Judases? Judas?

967
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:25,973
The one that betrayed Jesus? Judas, right?

968
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:27,516
Yeah, you're the fucking Judases.

969
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,226
Let's stop with the name-calling, guys.

970
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:30,645
- Backstabbers.
- Great.

971
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,813
Okay, guys, new rule: always double-check

972
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:35,858
that dead bad guys
are actually dead bad guys.

973
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:37,777
Holy shit!

974
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,403
This is a dead bad guy!

975
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:43,866
I don't know, I feel like my dead bad guy
is way worse than your dead bad guy.

976
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:45,670
"My dead bad"?
That's not your dead bad guy.

977
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,161
These are just dead bad guys.

978
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,580
Looks like a human-sized
ketchup packet exploded.

979
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:52,458
- Damn it.
- What?

980
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,061
Computer's busted. I can't get online.

981
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:56,921
Yeah, he is full-on spaghetti
and meat sauce down here.

982
00:45:57,004 --> 00:46:00,383
- Guys. I found a phone.
- What?

983
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,678
Wait a second.

984
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,805
Why does the dead bad guy
have this dude's number?

985
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:08,224
- Who?
- What are you, a fucking owl?

986
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:10,810
Yeah, I would love to be an owl, Darren.

987
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:13,562
So I could soar off into the night
hella majestically.

988
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:25,324
Wait, you have a phone?
You have to call for help.

989
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:28,995
Shh. No.

990
00:46:29,078 --> 00:46:30,329
I think he just screened me.

991
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:32,999
He screened the dead guy.
Don't take it personally.

992
00:46:33,082 --> 00:46:34,375
Shut up. Voicemail.

993
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,752
Hey, this is Darren and Joel.

994
00:46:36,836 --> 00:46:38,045
Yeah, I'm here too, so...

995
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:41,048
And Alexxx.
The, uh... the Dew'd Crew from the roof.

996
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:42,299
- Remember?
- Say "Skintendo."

997
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:44,218
We are calling
to find out what's going on.

998
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:46,303
There's, like...
people shooting and stuff.

999
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:49,427
Please give me a call back at this number,
uh, when it's a good time for you.

1000
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:50,599
Okay, give me the phone.

1001
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:52,536
- We'll talk then.
- It's not a conference call.

1002
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,562
We're not waiting for him to call back.

1003
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,189
You didn't even bring up
the two most important things:

1004
00:46:57,273 --> 00:47:01,193
the Bey and, I don't know,
how about the fucking check?

1005
00:47:01,277 --> 00:47:02,903
- Come on.
- The check.

1006
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:04,655
Mention a dead body. That'd be nice.

1007
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:06,379
Been a while since I've left a voicemail.

1008
00:47:06,449 --> 00:47:07,658
I'm gonna call him back, so...

1009
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:09,994
It's rude to just call right back.
You leave a message,

1010
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:11,537
- let them call you back.
- Darren...

1011
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:17,293
Ahmad, you dumb fuck.
You gotta call somebody, yo.

1012
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:20,713
- Fuck the police. Except for right now.
- You're gonna get us killed.

1013
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:23,716
You didn't turn it in.
You're putting everyone's lives at risk.

1014
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:25,919
I'm sorry, is there something
we should be discussing?

1015
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:26,969
No.

1016
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:35,436
Hold up.

1017
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:38,814
Why aren't you taking his phone?

1018
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:40,316
No, I don't see any phone.

1019
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:42,485
Um, you guys just be quiet over here.

1020
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:45,279
Your fucking creepy blue eyes
don't see the phone lighting up

1021
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:46,697
in his pocket right there?

1022
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:49,742
Also, it's making a noise.
It's going, "vuh, voo, vuh."

1023
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:51,327
It's over!

1024
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:54,246
Cut me free. Now!

1025
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:57,249
Wait, wait, wait.
Hey... this is not my fault.

1026
00:47:57,333 --> 00:48:00,169
Erma derailed the entire operation
the moment she got here.

1027
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:02,004
And has anyone noticed her accent?

1028
00:48:02,088 --> 00:48:05,466
The German accent? It's fake!
She grew up in Pacoima!

1029
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,051
Come on. She's a lunatic!

1030
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,636
Is this true, Erma?

1031
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,805
Yeah, I'm a lunatic.

1032
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:13,766
No, no, no. No. Give me...

1033
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,889
- Give me the gun.
- Gladly. See, told you.

1034
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:17,770
- I mean, what was I supposed to do?
- Right.

1035
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:19,647
Kill her. Like this.

1036
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:32,743
Lovely.

1037
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:35,621
Honestly, did not know
I was gonna do that.

1038
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:37,123
This whole thing was you?

1039
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:38,791
Mm, giving orders the whole time

1040
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:43,170
from the... "dusty-ass BlackBerry"
in my pocket.

1041
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:46,340
Physical keyboards
aren't so stupid now, are they?

1042
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:48,592
Nah, they're still dumb as fuck,

1043
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:52,596
and you still got atrocious-ass halitosis,
but I'm surprised.

1044
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:56,767
Yeah, well, at least my breath
doesn't smell like old-ass hyena pussy.

1045
00:48:56,851 --> 00:48:58,435
Oh, God.

1046
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:05,234
- Hello, Donald, you cheeky sausage.
- What?

1047
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,028
No, I think that Donald guy's dead.

1048
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:09,655
He either was sucked out of a window,

1049
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:11,949
or he choked on a computer.
So what's going on up there?

1050
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:14,910
- Speakerphone.
- Who is this?

1051
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:17,013
- Speaker.
- I'm going on speakerphone.

1052
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,038
- Dew'd Crew here.
- Hey.

1053
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:19,456
Lumber Jacks...

1054
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,834
- What? Uh, hi?
- How's the Bey doing?

1055
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,004
Wait, why do you have this guy's number?

1056
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:27,923
Wait, are you a bad guy too?

1057
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:30,259
Well, I suppose so, yes.

1058
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:35,598
But, um, you have just forced me
to become... unmistakably evil.

1059
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:40,603
Oh, fuck.

1060
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:42,980
I'll take the access codes now.

1061
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:44,063
Nah.

1062
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:47,902
Sorry, motherfucker. Can't do it.
That dude? I didn't know him.

1063
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,404
Shit, he might've let me live
if I gave him the codes.

1064
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:52,114
But you? Fuck you.

1065
00:49:52,198 --> 00:49:54,783
I know if I give you the codes, I'm dead.

1066
00:49:54,867 --> 00:49:56,619
And I know why.

1067
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,495
'Cause I made you eat that hooker's booty

1068
00:49:58,579 --> 00:50:00,206
at my birthday party, isn't it?

1069
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:05,669
This motherfucker ate a hooker's booty.
You had crabs in your teeth for a week.

1070
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:07,630
Remember shoving your face

1071
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:10,382
right up in that crab-infested
booty hole, bro?

1072
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:12,134
'Cause I do, you fucking loser.

1073
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:15,721
You dumb fucking fuck-hole.

1074
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:19,225
- You fucking suck.
- Very well.

1075
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:21,852
I'll acquire my compensation another way.

1076
00:50:21,936 --> 00:50:24,521
And while I wait to get paid, I'll...

1077
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:26,815
torture you. And kill you.

1078
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:30,653
Erma! We are sending a video
to the United States government.

1079
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:34,782
Oh! Also... bring me Shaggy.

1080
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,075
What the hell's going on?

1081
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:39,078
The fucking butler?

1082
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:43,082
Hey, guys, check it out.

1083
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:48,504
Whoa.

1084
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:50,130
Pigs brought the whole farm.

1085
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:53,592
- Yeah.
- Turn on the news.

1086
00:50:53,676 --> 00:50:54,843
Turn on the news.

1087
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:57,304
Okay.

1088
00:50:58,931 --> 00:51:00,307
Steve-O!

1089
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:01,991
- There, there, there.
- Steve-O!

1090
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:03,894
<i>Give me that mic. Give me that mic!</i>

1091
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:06,105
<i>Steve-O, if you can hear me
in the spirit world...</i>

1092
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:08,315
...I love you, brother.

1093
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:10,609
<i>It should've been you!
It should've been you.</i>

1094
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:13,362
<i>you. And </i>Channel 8.

1095
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:16,949
<i>Uh, okay, I'm... I'm just being told
we've received a video</i>

1096
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,617
<i>from the terrorists.</i>

1097
00:51:18,701 --> 00:51:22,204
<i>Warning: what you're about to see

1098
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:24,123
<i>Good evening.</i>

1099
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:28,043
<i>As you probably know, I've taken control
of the Level Hotel, Los Angeles.</i>

1100
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:30,713
<i>I had intentions of only taking money</i>

1101
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:33,632
<i>from a disrespectful
and arrogant billionaire child...</i>

1102
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:37,970
<i>but that was derailed
by some idiotic waiters.</i>

1103
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,097
Are we the idiotics?

1104
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,724
No, stupid. We're maids.

1105
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:46,645
<i>So now I'm holding 106 hostages
until I receive $500 million</i>

1106
00:51:46,729 --> 00:51:49,189
<i>and a helicopter,
which I will fly out of the U.S.</i>

1107
00:51:49,273 --> 00:51:53,319
<i>and release... the remaining hostages.</i>

1108
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:57,197
<i>Oh, I should add: any breach
of this building will trigger...</i>

1109
00:51:58,073 --> 00:52:00,242
<i>an explosive collar,</i>

1110
00:52:00,326 --> 00:52:02,494
<i>creating a mess no one wants to clean up.</i>

1111
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:06,749
<i>Additionally, I will kill one hostage
every 15 minutes</i>

1112
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:10,961
<i>to ensure prompt payment, starting... now.</i>

1113
00:52:11,045 --> 00:52:13,339
Oh, shit. That's hot.

1114
00:52:13,422 --> 00:52:16,383
<i>Bro... listen, man, listen.
We brothers. We brothers.</i>

1115
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:18,719
<i>We're supposed to be brothers, man!</i>

1116
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:22,306
<i>I could get you Stacey Dash's number.</i>

1117
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:24,475
Oh, shit!

1118
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,310
No, no, no, no. What?

1119
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:29,271
<i>As you can see,
</i>I'm holding up my end of the bargain.

1120
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:30,731
<i>I hope you do the same.</i>

1121
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:34,610
<i>And now, on a lighter note,
another must-see TV moment:</i>

1122
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:37,863
<i>a very chill performance... by Shaggy.</i>

1123
00:52:39,448 --> 00:52:42,284
<i>- Yeah, uh...
- Don't kill Shaggy. I fuckin' love Shaggy.</i>

1124
00:52:42,368 --> 00:52:44,679
- What is happening?
- Don't kill Shaggy. Don't kill Shaggy.

1125
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:49,083
<i>I wanna do this song that I wrote
for the earthquake victims of Haiti.</i>

1126
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:50,606
- <i>Sing "It Wasn't Me"!
</i>-Uh...

1127
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:53,962
<i>Dude, that's not really appropriate
for... for what...</i>

1128
00:52:54,046 --> 00:52:56,215
<i>No one wants to hear
</i>that Haiti shit!

1129
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:58,675
<i>Okay? They want "It Wasn't Me."
I want "It Wasn't Me."</i>

1130
00:52:58,759 --> 00:52:59,885
<i>Sing "It Wasn't Me."</i>

1131
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:01,678
- Sing it!
- Shaggy, please!

1132
00:53:01,762 --> 00:53:02,846
Sing it, Shaggy!

1142
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:34,294
Round everybody up! We're going inside.

1143
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:37,131
Shag, too soon, but I'm out.

1144
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:40,592
Yeah, yo, by all means.

1145
00:53:40,676 --> 00:53:42,556
What's the nearest room
that can accommodate us?

1146
00:53:42,678 --> 00:53:44,096
Uh, the conference room.

1147
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:47,474
But, ooh, it's dressed
for a convention tomorrow,

1148
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:50,238
so if you don't mind, I would appreciate
if we just stayed upstairs,

1149
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:51,437
not to mess it up.

1150
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,397
- Take everyone to the conference room!
- Okay.

1151
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,773
Come on, let's move.

1152
00:53:54,857 --> 00:53:58,026
I don't herd cattle.
I'll be hunting waiters.

1153
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:00,988
Bilbo, Dildo, you come with me.

1154
00:54:01,864 --> 00:54:05,451
You don't ask for respect, little girl.
You take it.

1155
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:10,497
Move it, ladies.
You got legs. Use 'em.

1156
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:12,501
- Move it, people.
- What the fuck is the holdup?

1157
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:15,502
- Everybody out.
- Keep moving! Let's go!

1158
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:17,129
Come on!

1159
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:22,509
Darren, look.

1160
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:25,179
They're going inside.

1161
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,305
So what?

1162
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:28,307
So they're contained.

1163
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:31,435
You can't contain machine guns, Darren.

1164
00:54:31,894 --> 00:54:33,562
How much salvia did you smoke?

1165
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:36,773
Shit, how much more do you have of that?

1166
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:39,735
I mean, there's a lot here,
but it is covered in glass.

1167
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:42,112
Not the sandwich, your salvia. How much?

1168
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:44,907
Oh, so now you want my help.

1169
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:46,783
Hmm, sure.

1170
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:48,619
Grab those guns and follow moi.

1171
00:54:57,794 --> 00:55:00,380
You got glass.
You got glass in your hair.

1172
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:07,179
I'm flippin' keys.

1173
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:11,433
Well, not yet, actually.
I've got some serious rebranding to do.

1174
00:55:11,517 --> 00:55:15,729
Turns out salvia isn't a very sexy drug
and no one likes it except for Darren...

1175
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:17,564
and, weirdly, the JV softball team.

1176
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:20,651
- Those girls get fuckin' wild.
- Okay, yeah, whatever, man.

1177
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:22,945
- This is perfect. This is great.
- Okay.

1178
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:27,074
Alexxx? Do you live here?

1179
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:29,284
Because it looks like you live here.

1180
00:55:29,368 --> 00:55:32,287
I don't live here.
No, you know who I think lives here?

1181
00:55:32,371 --> 00:55:33,455
Josué.

1182
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:36,750
Yeah, the maintenance guy?
That guy's... that guy's a weirdo.

1183
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,378
Yeah, like I was saying
about the rebranding...

1184
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:43,465
um, you know, like the Marlboro man,
but this is "Uncle Sal."

1185
00:55:43,549 --> 00:55:45,926
Sal-via? Get it?

1186
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:49,169
Dude, there's, like, a "Buffalo Bill went
to Costco" amount of lotion over here.

1187
00:55:49,221 --> 00:55:52,641
- Pfft. Hey, the salvia's back here, so...
- Yeah, yeah.

1188
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,769
Oh! And what is this?

1189
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:58,105
This is an oil painting of you on a throne

1190
00:55:58,188 --> 00:55:59,856
with money hanging out of your pockets

1191
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:02,109
and a bunch of tits
hovering around your head.

1192
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:04,653
Seems like he... he's a true artist
for real, but...

1193
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:06,029
that is weird, admittedly.

1194
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:08,282
- Salvia is this way, so...
- Yeah, okay.

1195
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:10,284
So Josué is up here painting you and...

1196
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:15,789
beating off to a porno parody
of your favorite childhood movie, Flubber?

1197
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:17,791
<i>"Flubbher." That's funny.</i>

1198
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:19,126
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

1199
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:20,419
Huh.

1200
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:26,174
Fine! Yes, I live here, okay?
I jerk off up here. I paint myself here.

1201
00:56:26,258 --> 00:56:28,885
I jerk off while painting myself.
Is that what you wanted to hear?

1202
00:56:28,969 --> 00:56:30,470
- Jesus Christ.
- This isn't that bad.

1203
00:56:30,554 --> 00:56:31,722
I'm saving up all the money,

1204
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:33,807
so I'm gonna buy a Maybach
in like six years.

1205
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:36,768
I'm an adult homeless man
stuck in a balling-ass body,

1206
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:38,604
but I put my pride aside

1207
00:56:38,687 --> 00:56:40,814
and took you to my grow house
to save the fucking day.

1208
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:43,567
- So you're welcome.
- Well, it's a grow closet at best,

1209
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,612
but it's definitely enough salvia
to hotbox the whole conference room.

1210
00:56:46,695 --> 00:56:49,656
I mean, we can knock them on their asses,
take their weapons, lock them in.

1211
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,992
- We could kill 'em.
- No, not kill them.

1212
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,952
What do you mean?
You guys already got a kill.

1213
00:56:54,036 --> 00:56:57,372
I haven't gotten a kill yet, so it's...
it's kind of fair that I'd get one.

1214
00:56:57,456 --> 00:56:58,790
You can have my kill.

1215
00:56:58,874 --> 00:57:00,500
I don't want your kill. I want my own.

1216
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:02,711
Look... I like this plan.

1217
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:06,173
Cool, good. We gotta figure out how to get
the smoke into the conference room.

1218
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,467
I'm thinking the maintenance breezeway.
The vents there?

1219
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:09,885
If we can go in the ducts...

1220
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:11,511
No, I don't... I can't.

1221
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:13,013
Figure it out. Look at all this.

1222
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:14,681
- Build something, man.
- I mean,

1223
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:16,350
there's a ton of lotion.

1224
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:19,645
What, we should just jerk the goons off
into submission?

1225
00:57:19,728 --> 00:57:21,104
Just build something, man!

1226
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:23,268
This is a trash heap.
There's nothing I can use here.

1227
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:25,150
Yeah, this is all my belongings, so...

1228
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:28,445
Hold on.

1229
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:31,990
I got it. I got it! I'll draw it up
so you know what I'm talking about.

1230
00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:34,326
Oh, the wheels are turning!

1231
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:36,244
All right. So what do I get to do?

1232
00:57:36,328 --> 00:57:38,163
You? Oh, nothing.

1233
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:40,999
You just stay out of the way.
Okay? You've done enough.

1234
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,087
On your feet!

1235
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,463
On your feet now!

1236
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:50,968
- Ooh, tough guy.
- Shut up.

1237
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:53,887
- Shut up!
- Yeah, you smell bad.

1238
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:56,098
What, did you shit in your pants?

1239
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:57,891
Shit.

1240
00:57:57,975 --> 00:57:59,810
Wow, wow. You think I'm scared of you

1241
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:02,729
'cause you got a gun in my face? Fuck off.

1242
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:04,523
Bet you think you're gonna buy respect

1243
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:06,209
with all that money too, huh?

1244
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:08,068
Well, it bought you respect.

1245
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:11,363
What, you think these people like you
because they follow you online?

1246
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:14,741
You know, half his followers are bots.

1247
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:16,827
Okay? He's not as famous as you think.

1248
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,830
Yo, point is, I blow their fucking minds.

1249
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:21,999
All you do is hate and take.

1250
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:27,129
Well, um... why don't we...

1251
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:29,840
"blow their minds" now?

1252
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:34,219
You there. Bring him over here.

1253
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,972
I didn't do anything. What's going on?

1254
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:40,142
Oh, no, no. Jesus... oh, God.

1255
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:41,351
Please don't hurt me.

1256
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:44,104
My intentions are to do
quite the opposite.

1257
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:47,774
Strip his pants. Bend him over the table.

1258
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:50,027
No. What the fuck?

1259
00:58:50,569 --> 00:58:51,903
What...? No.

1260
00:58:53,572 --> 00:58:54,572
Oh, Jesus.

1261
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:56,866
Let me up.

1262
00:58:57,284 --> 00:58:58,827
You made me eat that...

1263
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:03,999
...hooker ass.

1264
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:05,459
Yeah.

1265
00:59:06,585 --> 00:59:09,504
Now let's see you muster any respect

1266
00:59:09,588 --> 00:59:13,759
after you toss this fat fuck's salad.

1267
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:15,594
Whoa, whoa. Ahmad! Ahmad.

1268
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:18,055
Whoa, it's so dark.

1269
00:59:18,138 --> 00:59:20,640
Do it, or he's a dead man.

1270
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:23,310
All right, I just wanna say
one thing, dog.

1271
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:25,687
Didn't have to be this way.

1272
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:29,274
Oh!

1273
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:35,822
Stop...

1274
00:59:36,907 --> 00:59:40,202
What the fuck? Ooh, what the fuck?

1275
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:44,873
- Yeah.
- Ooh. Wait... wait, okay.

1276
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:46,625
Whoa. Are you guys seeing this?

1277
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:49,211
Do you see this? Bey's eating my ass.

1278
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:53,090
I'm getting my salad tossed by Bey!

1279
00:59:53,173 --> 00:59:54,841
Someone 'Gram this!

1280
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:57,511
- Right, enough...
- I'm not done, motherfucker!

1281
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:02,307
All right, stop it! Get him up. Up.
Enough, enough!

1282
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:04,351
Just a little bit longer.

1283
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:06,353
What happened?

1284
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:07,979
You tried to embarrass me?

1285
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:09,439
I done fucked 10,000 women.

1286
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:12,234
You don't think I ate a grip
of dude-booties along the way?

1287
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,611
Yeah-yeah!

1288
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:17,864
You may not be able
to feel embarrassment. I get it.

1289
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:20,534
But prepare to feel suffering.

1290
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:25,539
Let's try this again.

1291
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:29,042
Bring me the correct
corresponding breach sensor.

1292
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:38,343
Oh, I-I hope he can swim.
Ah! Oh!

1293
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:40,387
- What...
- Oh, oh, oh.

1294
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:42,764
- What the fuck, man?
- Squat.

1295
01:00:42,848 --> 01:00:44,474
Okay.

1296
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:46,810
These. We know what these do.

1297
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:48,895
- No. Ahmad, Ahmad...
- Yeah.

1298
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:52,023
Oh, oh.
Oh, is that... yeah.

1299
01:00:58,029 --> 01:00:59,489
Lower.

1300
01:00:59,573 --> 01:01:00,949
Lower.

1301
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:02,616
Perfect.

1302
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:05,912
Fuck, they got Chet!

1303
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:09,583
How the fuck is that possible?
They're fuckin' waiters.

1304
01:01:13,128 --> 01:01:14,462
Weren't you just

1305
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:18,466
a fucking garbageman a few years ago?

1306
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:25,307
This way.

1307
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:30,020
I don't really appreciate you putting
my résumé in the street like that.

1308
01:01:30,729 --> 01:01:31,813
Tell me you were driving

1309
01:01:31,897 --> 01:01:33,732
- the fucking truck.
- Fuck you, man.

1310
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:42,365
- That should do it.
- Good.

1311
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:44,117
All right, so we patch into the air duct.

1312
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:46,536
We hit the switch. We wait 30, 45 seconds.

1313
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:49,080
Until the bad guys pass out.
We zip tie them, take their guns,

1314
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:51,958
and free the hostages.
I know. It's my plan.

1315
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:54,044
Okay, cool. You can have a sticker
or something.

1316
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:55,689
- What are you doing? Come on.
- Sorry.

1317
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,256
All right, pick a gun.

1318
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:00,884
No, no. I am not using a gun.

1319
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:03,303
All right? My brain is my weapon.

1320
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:05,013
And it is fully loaded, sir.

1321
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:07,641
Okay, fine. Then you wheel the cart.

1322
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:10,352
What did I say?
Please don't do that, okay? Just...

1323
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:12,479
grab the extension cord.

1324
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:14,397
Let's go.

1325
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:40,632
- You feeling tired yet?
- Fuck you.

1326
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:42,801
You're like the worst Bond villain ever.

1327
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:44,719
You might as well just kill me, 'cause...

1328
01:02:44,803 --> 01:02:47,138
...I ain't gettin' tired.

1329
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:50,183
Well, Lil Puma
looks kind of tuckered out.

1330
01:02:50,809 --> 01:02:52,852
Maybe we should put him out of his misery.

1331
01:03:24,718 --> 01:03:26,553
Wowee!

1332
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:29,347
Now, that... that was fun. Oh, God.

1333
01:03:29,431 --> 01:03:30,557
Take respect.

1334
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:31,850
- Don't ask.
- Yeah!

1335
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:33,435
- Take.
- Oh!

1336
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:35,645
Did you see all the fuckin' blood
in that water?

1337
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:39,399
How much blood was in that dog?
It's like a fuckin' bloodhound!

1338
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:40,482
All right, mister!

1339
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:44,654
I think we have all had just about enough!
Right?

1340
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:47,615
Your treatment of our hotel guest
is unacceptable,

1341
01:03:47,699 --> 01:03:51,036
not to mention your complete
and utter disregard for hotel property!

1342
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:53,079
And you killed the little rat puppy!

1343
01:03:53,163 --> 01:03:57,042
As acting manager of the Level Hotel,
I am telling you,

1344
01:03:57,125 --> 01:03:58,793
this ends now!

1345
01:03:58,877 --> 01:04:01,087
Oh, God.

1346
01:04:03,131 --> 01:04:05,175
Just... There you are.

1347
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:06,343
That's better.

1348
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:09,304
Look at the time.

1349
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:13,767
It appears the U.S. government
doesn't care about you.

1350
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:17,187
In 60 seconds, someone will die.

1351
01:04:18,313 --> 01:04:20,774
But, uh, I think I'm done with killing.

1352
01:04:21,316 --> 01:04:24,694
For a little while, at least, um...

1353
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:28,615
Don't talk.

1354
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:31,076
- You.
- Oh, shit.

1355
01:04:31,159 --> 01:04:32,159
No. Babe.

1356
01:04:32,202 --> 01:04:34,120
Do something. Volunteer as tribute.

1357
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:35,204
- Do something!
- Up.

1358
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:36,915
Do something! Oh, God. Okay.

1359
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:38,625
And...

1360
01:04:40,919 --> 01:04:43,088
No way. You.

1361
01:04:43,171 --> 01:04:44,798
Cut them free, please.

1362
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:45,881
Step forward.

1363
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:54,557
Now...

1364
01:04:54,641 --> 01:04:55,767
fight to the death.

1365
01:04:57,394 --> 01:04:59,187
What? No.

1366
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:02,273
I'm sending this... Oh!

1367
01:05:02,357 --> 01:05:04,234
...to the news next.

1368
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:07,320
- Look, I'm not killing her.
- Okay.

1369
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:10,323
One of you kill the other...
or I shoot you both.

1370
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:14,869
<i>Look, anybody who can see this,
I don't wanna do this!</i>

1371
01:05:14,953 --> 01:05:17,330
<i>I am not a murderer!</i>

1372
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:18,873
You got that right!

1373
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:21,937
- Christ.
- Shit, I killed him.

1374
01:05:22,252 --> 01:05:23,837
<i>J-Joel...</i>

1375
01:05:24,546 --> 01:05:26,172
<i>Now, that's what I call television.</i>

1376
01:05:26,256 --> 01:05:27,632
<i>But let's not do it again.</i>

1377
01:05:27,715 --> 01:05:29,676
<i>Bring me my money, my helicopter.</i>

1378
01:05:30,802 --> 01:05:32,929
- Did they put the money together yet?
- Just now.

1379
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:34,556
Tell 'em to get the chopper up now.

1380
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:35,473
Yes, sir.

1381
01:05:37,267 --> 01:05:39,394
Hey, dude. Keep it down.

1382
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:52,115
Hey. Hurry the fuck up.

1383
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:54,033
Okay, do you want me to be fast or quiet?

1384
01:05:54,117 --> 01:05:55,952
'Cause that guy's about to kill somebody.

1385
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:58,121
Come on, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1386
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:08,798
Come on, come on, move it.

1387
01:06:26,608 --> 01:06:28,234
It was just working. Oop.

1388
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:29,918
You're gonna die so fast compared to me.

1389
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:31,905
Okay. It's ready.

1390
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:34,616
- I got the torch. Need a lighter.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Here.

1391
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:36,534
Okay, just hand it to me. All right.

1392
01:06:36,618 --> 01:06:37,994
And, uh, plug in the fan.

1393
01:06:38,077 --> 01:06:40,288
- Hurry!
- I'm going to. Where's the extension cord?

1394
01:06:41,331 --> 01:06:42,916
Oh, was I supposed to bring that?

1395
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:44,709
Yeah, I said bring it.

1396
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:48,588
Yeah, well, you also said
you didn't need my help.

1397
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:51,716
Then you cut me out of the Skintendo.

1398
01:06:51,799 --> 01:06:54,427
So, I don't know,
I guess I was just a little confused.

1399
01:06:56,346 --> 01:06:59,057
- Alexxx, no.
- Dude.

1400
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:01,768
Please do not be a complete piece of shit

1401
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:03,686
and tell me you brought
that extension cord.

1402
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:04,896
Mm-mm-mm.

1403
01:07:05,647 --> 01:07:08,149
You're playing games because
we wouldn't let you be in charge?

1404
01:07:08,233 --> 01:07:10,461
Dude, those people are counting on us.

1405
01:07:10,485 --> 01:07:13,321
Forget it. It's fine. Just... you're gonna
have to build a longer tube,

1406
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:14,239
some kind of conduit.

1407
01:07:14,322 --> 01:07:17,075
Just get some more fucking...
grocery bags or...

1408
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:18,576
- Uh...
- No, no, no.

1409
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:19,494
Fuck you.

1410
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:22,914
You are so fucking selfish,
it's disgusting.

1411
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:27,335
I'm serious when I say this,
as maybe a friend,

1412
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:28,778
but you better... watch your back.

1413
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:30,129
Dude, you watch your back.

1414
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:31,853
- No, dude, behind you!
- Watch your back!

1415
01:07:36,261 --> 01:07:37,136
Fuck!

1416
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:39,264
Don't shoot them, you idiot.

1417
01:07:39,347 --> 01:07:40,640
They're mine.

1418
01:07:41,683 --> 01:07:43,476
Damn it.

1419
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:57,824
Well, well.

1420
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:02,120
Looks like Little Miss Tough Girl
ain't so tough anymore, is she?

1421
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:06,708
We gonna have some fun.

1422
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:12,964
- Split up!
- Split up!

1423
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:16,342
Shit! Go this way!

1424
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:21,598
- No!
- Oh, shit!

1425
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:22,890
What are you doing? Split up!

1426
01:08:22,974 --> 01:08:24,726
- Yeah, we did!
- I meant all of us.

1427
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:28,855
I need a minute, man.
I got to take a little trip somewhere.

1428
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:31,524
What? Oh, fuck no.

1429
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:34,360
You're gonna smoke salvia
while we're being hunted by murderers?

1430
01:08:34,444 --> 01:08:35,445
That's right. Know why?

1431
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:37,728
'Cause I don't wanna know
I'm being hunted by murderers.

1432
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:40,116
Oh, yeah, suck it down, you fuckin' sicko.

1433
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:45,788
What about Alexxx, man?
We got to find him.

1434
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:49,125
Shit!

1435
01:09:08,353 --> 01:09:10,271
Get ready to be my first kill!

1436
01:09:10,355 --> 01:09:13,358
Yeah? Be prepared to be my millionth.

1437
01:09:16,361 --> 01:09:17,361
Yeah, right!

1438
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:19,489
If you'd said nine or ten,

1439
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:21,612
I'd be like, "This guy's a murderer,"
but a million?

1440
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:24,077
It's way too many!
That's too many murders!

1441
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,370
No!

1442
01:09:41,386 --> 01:09:42,220
No!

1443
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:56,943
Oh, God!

1444
01:09:57,026 --> 01:10:01,280
I'm gonna fucking kill you,
you son of a bitch.

1445
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:04,492
My bad.

1446
01:10:06,577 --> 01:10:08,538
Oh! I'm so sorry!

1447
01:10:09,247 --> 01:10:12,208
I'm sorry! I don't want to!

1448
01:10:14,752 --> 01:10:16,754
Fuck you!

1449
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:31,561
Follow me.

1450
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:43,156
Great. Back in El Jizzblaster's room.

1451
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:46,075
- So what now?
- Nothing.

1452
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,245
Okay? We're done.

1453
01:10:49,328 --> 01:10:51,956
You ruined our best shot
at ending all this.

1454
01:10:52,039 --> 01:10:53,332
Fuck you!

1455
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:57,295
Okay, good. You're fired up.

1456
01:10:57,879 --> 01:11:00,298
So I won't take that personally.
Now let's use that energy...

1457
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:01,883
Alexxx, take it personally.

1458
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:04,552
We're done following you around for good.

1459
01:11:08,139 --> 01:11:12,685
Whatever. You guys are doing A-okay
without me, right?

1460
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:15,021
Working in secret
on the Skintendo Joysuit?

1461
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:16,584
How long has that been going on, huh?

1462
01:11:16,647 --> 01:11:17,940
Jesus Christ. Years.

1463
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:21,861
I can't believe I followed
a loser like you around for years.

1464
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:23,237
I'm not a loser!

1465
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:26,532
Whoa! Hey! No!

1466
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:29,660
You just shot at me?

1467
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:31,871
I shot near you, bitch.

1468
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:33,998
Okay.

1469
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:36,291
Me too, then.

1470
01:11:39,337 --> 01:11:40,463
You son of a...

1471
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,968
Guys! Stop.

1472
01:11:46,052 --> 01:11:47,252
Shut up, Baby Dunc.

1473
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:50,515
My name is Joel, you idiots!

1474
01:11:54,519 --> 01:11:56,646
Oh, shit! Oh!

1475
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:01,316
Oh!

1476
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:11,536
Oh, I wish this were fucking loaded, dude,

1477
01:12:11,619 --> 01:12:14,080
'cause then I would put it there
right through your skull!

1478
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:16,643
Well, if this was loaded,
I'd come sideways on you like ka-kow.

1479
01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:19,507
Really? 'Cause it'd come out
the other side, and I'd just suture it up.

1480
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:21,465
Oh, okay, well, then my gun
has a bayonet on it,

1481
01:12:21,546 --> 01:12:22,922
and I'd, ugh, un-suture your face!

1482
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:24,799
Oh, really?
Guess what. I got more sutures.

1483
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:27,635
- Suture, suture, suture.
- What, motherfucker? You spell "suture"!

1484
01:12:27,718 --> 01:12:28,761
You spell "suture"!

1485
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:30,429
I'm doing this too.

1486
01:12:32,515 --> 01:12:35,434
I wish this were fuckin' loaded, dude.

1487
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:39,522
This is loaded.

1488
01:12:42,233 --> 01:12:44,193
Rich to Mr. Ahmad. I found those waiters.

1489
01:12:44,861 --> 01:12:45,862
We're housekeepers.

1490
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:49,115
<i>Perfect timing. Bring them to
</i>the conference room. I'll kill them next.

1491
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:51,868
Too late. They're already dead.

1492
01:12:52,535 --> 01:12:53,828
Oh, good.

1493
01:12:53,911 --> 01:12:55,329
Erma got them?

1494
01:12:55,413 --> 01:12:58,124
No, me. I'll be up in five.

1495
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:02,044
Mr. Ahmad. There's a chopper approaching.

1496
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:06,215
You guys look exhausted.

1497
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:08,634
Let's hit the spa.

1498
01:13:09,927 --> 01:13:11,053
Move!

1499
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:16,350
I've been waiting for these pics
for a long-ass time now.

1500
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:20,605
Yo, the guys are gonna love this.

1501
01:13:20,688 --> 01:13:22,064
You look motherfucking insane.

1502
01:13:23,691 --> 01:13:26,569
Come on, that shit is funny. I know
you got a big-ass dick on your face,

1503
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:28,029
but hey, poo-poo head?

1504
01:13:28,112 --> 01:13:29,673
- That's some funny shit right...
- Mm-mm.

1505
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,617
I thought that shit was funny.

1506
01:13:38,748 --> 01:13:40,708
Okay, okay, okay.
You hate America.

1507
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:42,126
Man, I get that.

1508
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:43,920
Slavery, drones,

1509
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:46,547
they just discontinued
the KFC Double Down out of nowhere,

1510
01:13:46,631 --> 01:13:48,591
but, like, come on, man, we're good guys.

1511
01:13:51,886 --> 01:13:53,095
I'm here for the money.

1512
01:13:53,804 --> 01:13:56,644
And after this job, Jared and I
were finally gonna get away from it all.

1513
01:13:56,682 --> 01:13:58,935
Is that the, uh... the guy upstairs?

1514
01:13:59,018 --> 01:14:01,270
- Yeah, it's the guy upstairs.
- What is that?

1515
01:14:01,354 --> 01:14:02,438
What is that?

1516
01:14:04,607 --> 01:14:06,984
You don't know what it's like
to lose someone like that.

1517
01:14:07,068 --> 01:14:08,319
I do.

1518
01:14:08,402 --> 01:14:09,862
I pushed them away myself.

1519
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:13,741
Oh, fuck.

1520
01:14:15,785 --> 01:14:17,411
Don't fuck with me, asshole.

1521
01:14:18,371 --> 01:14:19,705
I'm just getting started.

1522
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:24,210
Now, you know what?
Let's relax a little bit.

1523
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:25,711
Let's turn these off.

1524
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:27,630
There you go.

1525
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:29,130
Now...

1526
01:14:29,924 --> 01:14:32,259
What's next on your spa menu...

1527
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:36,389
Have you guys ever had...

1528
01:14:37,014 --> 01:14:39,100
a lava stone massage?

1529
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:40,434
No.

1530
01:14:40,518 --> 01:14:41,852
We're maids, man.

1531
01:14:41,936 --> 01:14:43,688
We can't even afford a lava lamp.

1532
01:14:43,771 --> 01:14:46,190
Oh, they're fabulous.

1533
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:53,364
Oh, this is gonna feel so good.

1534
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:56,826
For me.
It's gonna really, really hurt you.

1535
01:14:56,909 --> 01:14:58,077
No. No, no, no!

1536
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,997
- Oh, yeah!
- Fuck!

1537
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:02,540
Let's get out those knots!

1538
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:06,002
- Stop it! Just stop! Stop doing it.
- Stop!

1539
01:15:06,085 --> 01:15:08,504
Please. We're sorry
we killed your friend, seriously.

1540
01:15:09,463 --> 01:15:10,463
My what?

1541
01:15:11,716 --> 01:15:13,092
- My what?
- Your friend.

1542
01:15:13,718 --> 01:15:15,011
My friend?

1543
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:18,180
- You sound like my dad!
- Okay.

1544
01:15:18,264 --> 01:15:19,807
He wasn't my friend!

1545
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:21,225
He was my everything!

1546
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:22,685
Ow!

1547
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:24,645
Hey, fuckface!

1548
01:15:24,729 --> 01:15:28,065
- Alexxx, stop. What are you doing?
- No, no, no, no. Fuck this crybaby.

1549
01:15:28,149 --> 01:15:31,152
Oh, why you being
such a fucking cwybaby?

1550
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:32,945
"Ooh, my lover's dead."

1551
01:15:33,487 --> 01:15:34,655
You know what you should do?

1552
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:37,783
Take your own dick,
shove it up your own butt,

1553
01:15:37,867 --> 01:15:39,994
impregnate it, have a butt baby.

1554
01:15:40,077 --> 01:15:42,038
You know what I'd call him?

1555
01:15:42,121 --> 01:15:43,372
Jared Jr.

1556
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:45,124
- Hey, fuck you.
- Fuck you.

1557
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:47,626
You just earned yourself a deep tissue.

1558
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:49,962
This guy and the fucking puns, am I right?

1559
01:15:54,759 --> 01:15:55,801
Oh, my God.

1567
01:16:36,926 --> 01:16:38,928
Is he dead?

1568
01:16:41,764 --> 01:16:42,848
Ew.

1569
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:45,935
This dude definitely

1570
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:47,228
Yeah.

1571
01:16:47,812 --> 01:16:50,106
That was a really good idea
about the oil spill.

1572
01:16:50,898 --> 01:16:54,485
Yeah, thanks. I wasn't, uh, sure
what your plan was, but yeah.

1573
01:16:54,568 --> 01:16:58,197
Yeah, I didn't really have a plan, per se.

1574
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:00,699
I mean, it is me, after all, so...

1575
01:17:04,203 --> 01:17:07,623
I just wanted to do something selfless
for you guys for once.

1576
01:17:08,999 --> 01:17:09,999
Yeah.

1577
01:17:11,127 --> 01:17:13,212
And that's what you bring
to the table, man.

1578
01:17:14,004 --> 01:17:18,509
When we're ready to just lay down and die,
you step up.

1579
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:23,430
I would cry if it wasn't such
a bitch-ass thing to do.

1580
01:17:23,514 --> 01:17:24,557
So I'm not going to.

1581
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,308
- Don't cry.
- Do not cry.

1582
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:28,561
Got this.

1583
01:17:29,395 --> 01:17:31,397
But I will let you guys know...

1584
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,232
that I fucking love you, dog.

1585
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:36,902
- I really love you.
- Darren, I fucking love you.

1586
01:17:37,862 --> 01:17:38,863
Count me in.

1587
01:17:41,782 --> 01:17:42,782
What's up?

1588
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:46,537
- And also with you.
- Take it, just take it.

1589
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:50,541
That's fine. I'm okay with you repressing
your emotions for now,

1590
01:17:50,624 --> 01:17:53,502
because I understand
the type of upbringing that you've had.

1591
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:57,131
And just know
that if we make it out of here alive,

1592
01:17:57,965 --> 01:17:59,466
I wanna see those upgrades.

1593
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:01,302
I wanna be that dude that...

1594
01:18:02,094 --> 01:18:03,971
...that helps you guys
get your ideas made.

1595
01:18:04,054 --> 01:18:06,056
I wanna be the fertilizer. I am the shit.

1596
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:09,935
And you guys are the little idea seeds
that are gonna be planted within me,

1597
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:11,395
and we are gonna blossom...

1598
01:18:11,478 --> 01:18:14,190
...and make a little Skintendo flower.

1599
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:20,487
You know what?

1600
01:18:20,571 --> 01:18:22,406
Let's build Skintendo right now.

1601
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:25,326
Don't know what I said.
I sort of was just talking.

1602
01:18:25,409 --> 01:18:27,328
Let's do it. Tonight.

1603
01:18:27,411 --> 01:18:28,787
But why? For what?

1604
01:18:29,663 --> 01:18:31,332
To kill bad guys.

1605
01:18:31,415 --> 01:18:33,667
- Fuck yes.
- So what do you say?

1606
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:35,085
Baby Dunc, you ready?

1607
01:18:35,169 --> 01:18:36,169
Sorry.

1608
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:38,505
Joel.

1609
01:18:38,589 --> 01:18:41,217
- You up for this?
- Yeah.

1610
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:42,718
I can make it happen.

1611
01:18:46,013 --> 01:18:47,973
And I think I know how. Oh!

1612
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:51,435
- Just got my baby hairs.
- Sure.

1613
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:54,855
How exactly does
this friend-control mode thing work?

1614
01:18:54,939 --> 01:18:58,400
Okay, so you know how the suit
can control the character in the game?

1615
01:18:58,484 --> 01:18:59,401
I do, yeah.

1616
01:18:59,485 --> 01:19:02,321
Friend-control mode
takes that concept to another level.

1617
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:06,951
But I didn't have any of my material,
so I had to use the electro stim pads

1618
01:19:07,034 --> 01:19:10,037
to control his muscles.
Unfortunately, I ran out of stim pads,

1619
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:12,331
so it can pretty much
just walk and spin.

1620
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:15,209
Which is why I loaded the fists
full of those lava stones.

1621
01:19:15,292 --> 01:19:18,837
So it's kind of like a, uh,
swinging sledgehammer type thing.

1622
01:19:18,921 --> 01:19:20,005
Nice work, Joel.

1623
01:19:21,548 --> 01:19:23,842
Sledgehammer spin-punching
robo-zombie.

1624
01:19:23,926 --> 01:19:25,195
- Yeah.
- Cool.

1625
01:19:25,219 --> 01:19:28,430
And the air fresheners are because...

1626
01:19:28,514 --> 01:19:30,015
- He shit himself earlier.
- Mm-hm.

1627
01:19:30,099 --> 01:19:31,392
- So...
- In the spa.

1628
01:19:31,475 --> 01:19:33,475
- Little funky.
- Right, okay. Let's see something.

1629
01:19:33,936 --> 01:19:35,688
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1630
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:37,481
Oh, punching. Oh.

1631
01:19:37,564 --> 01:19:38,899
- Ooh, shit!
- Nice.

1632
01:19:38,983 --> 01:19:40,317
- It's good.
- Cool.

1633
01:19:40,401 --> 01:19:41,401
Okay, uh-oh.

1634
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:43,203
- Give me a shimmy-shimmy.
- We should, uh...

1635
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:44,280
Shake-a-shake-a-shake.

1636
01:19:44,363 --> 01:19:46,049
- Dab it on him. Dab it on him.
- ...attack?

1637
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:47,993
- Alexxx, let's attack, please.
- Wiggle, wiggle.

1638
01:19:48,033 --> 01:19:49,201
Yep, okay, yep.

1639
01:19:49,535 --> 01:19:50,786
Nope, nope! No, no, no, no.

1640
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:52,538
- Okay, all right.
- It's just actually...

1641
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:53,706
no, I'm not ready.

1642
01:19:53,789 --> 01:19:55,149
I have to tell you guys something,

1643
01:19:55,249 --> 01:19:57,793
and it's been weighing on me
for a long time.

1644
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:00,963
- I am...
- A gay guy.

1645
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:03,674
Yep, we know. Zero to hero, go!

1646
01:20:03,757 --> 01:20:05,217
Just don't have time, sorry.

1647
01:20:08,387 --> 01:20:09,930
Rich, where have you been?

1648
01:20:10,014 --> 01:20:11,473
And what...

1649
01:20:11,557 --> 01:20:13,225
what are you... what are you wearing?

1650
01:20:14,518 --> 01:20:16,770
Yo. It's the suit.

1651
01:20:16,854 --> 01:20:18,439
Fuck you, bad guys.

1652
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:20,024
Fuck you, bad guys!

It's your drunk thing. Get the guy.

1660
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,810
Yeah, the first time was prom
our senior year,

1661
01:20:56,894 --> 01:20:58,812
and then a bunch of times in New Orleans.

1662
01:20:58,896 --> 01:21:02,983
Something about Bourbon Street, man.
It brings it out of you, and then...

1663
01:21:03,067 --> 01:21:05,402
Then when we got Osama bin Laden,
we all got really drunk,

1664
01:21:05,486 --> 01:21:07,905
and you wouldn't shut the fuck up

You've never brought it up sober,
so we were kind of waiting for you to...

01:21:20,042 --> 01:21:21,293
well, do what you're doing now.

We're not.

01:23:19,745 --> 01:23:21,497
Erma, have your fun
and get up to the roof.

1708
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:22,789
Alan, grab what you can.

1709
01:23:22,873 --> 01:23:27,628
Oh, shit, your boyfriend's leaving.
You should probably roll with him, right?

1710
01:23:27,711 --> 01:23:30,923
He is not... my boyfriend!

1711
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:32,508
Okay, you're single. Cool. What's up?

1712
01:23:32,591 --> 01:23:36,762
I... am a trained killer on a job.

1713
01:23:37,471 --> 01:23:38,514
And you...

1714
01:23:39,306 --> 01:23:41,099
are in my office.

1715
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:46,730
Uh, Joel, what are you doing?
She's gonna blow your brains out, man.

1716
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:53,529
You... need to apologize.

1717
01:23:54,112 --> 01:23:55,112
Okay?

1718
01:23:55,405 --> 01:23:56,740
He's gay now.

1719
01:24:05,999 --> 01:24:07,668
Oh, shit.

1720
01:24:13,131 --> 01:24:16,385
I don't do apologies, faggot.

1721
01:24:16,927 --> 01:24:20,055
Ooh, I know you didn't
just call me the F word!

1722
01:24:20,138 --> 01:24:21,848
Joel, you haven't even fucked a dude yet.

1723
01:24:21,932 --> 01:24:23,600
Yes, I have.

1724
01:24:23,684 --> 01:24:25,644
And in the butt's better than vagina.

1725
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:28,564
- Way better.
- Chicks have butts too, though.

1726
01:24:32,317 --> 01:24:35,028
Oh! Whoa, dude, I just slapped
the shit out of her.

1727
01:24:35,112 --> 01:24:36,992
- Yeah, you did.
- That was awesome. Nice, Joel.

1728
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:38,072
- Look out!
- Watch out!

1729
01:24:38,115 --> 01:24:39,157
Oh!

1730
01:24:39,241 --> 01:24:41,660
This ends now!

1731
01:24:44,454 --> 01:24:46,039
- Oh, man!
- Oh, no.

1732
01:24:48,834 --> 01:24:50,335
- Get him, Erma!
- Come on, Joel!

1733
01:24:50,419 --> 01:24:52,087
Let's go, Joel!

1734
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:54,631
Take that!

1735
01:24:54,715 --> 01:24:56,216
- Yeah!
- Little fucker!

1736
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:58,218
Yeah, fuck you, bitch!

1737
01:25:00,053 --> 01:25:04,516
You like that? You like picking on people
'cause they're different?

1738
01:25:12,816 --> 01:25:14,776
No, no! Joel!

1739
01:25:22,868 --> 01:25:24,161
Right in the numbers.

1740
01:25:39,301 --> 01:25:40,802
Yes!

1741
01:25:40,886 --> 01:25:42,262
Yes!

1742
01:25:42,346 --> 01:25:44,181
- You get outta here.
- Ha!

1743
01:25:45,807 --> 01:25:47,517
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

1744
01:25:47,601 --> 01:25:50,395
Baby Dunc with the slam dunk.

1745
01:25:50,479 --> 01:25:53,065
Yes! Tom fucking Brady!

1746
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:54,066
- Not Tom Brady.
- No.

1747
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:56,069
- He plays football, not basketball.
- Slam dunk.

1748
01:25:56,109 --> 01:25:57,903
If anyone's Tom Brady, it's my man Mitch.

1749
01:25:57,986 --> 01:26:00,066
- We thought you were dead, dude.
- Mitch, your dick.

1750
01:26:00,113 --> 01:26:02,407
Eh, don't worry about it, boys.

1751
01:26:02,491 --> 01:26:03,992
We live in Los Angeles.

1752
01:26:04,076 --> 01:26:08,455
Eh, I give it eight weeks before me
and the Swamp Thing get reattached,

1753
01:26:08,538 --> 01:26:11,058
or regrown, or whatever the hell
they're gonna do to get us back

1754
01:26:11,124 --> 01:26:13,085
to fuckin' half this town,
am I right, boy?

1755
01:26:13,168 --> 01:26:15,295
Is everybody okay? Huh?

1756
01:26:15,379 --> 01:26:17,881
Cassie, huh? You okay?

1757
01:26:17,964 --> 01:26:22,010
Yeah, I-I'm a little shaken, but I feel...
oh, I feel okay.

1758
01:26:22,094 --> 01:26:25,472
Hey... that promotion is yours.

1759
01:26:25,555 --> 01:26:27,140
- Really?
- You earned it.

1760
01:26:27,224 --> 01:26:30,018
- Yes.
- Now put my pecker on ice, huh?

1761
01:26:30,102 --> 01:26:31,228
Wow, what a night, boys.

1762
01:26:31,311 --> 01:26:34,106
I have been crawling around this hotel
for hours.

1763
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:35,691
- Ooh.
- You know what, Mitch?

1764
01:26:35,774 --> 01:26:37,859
- Huh?
- I have a better idea.

1765
01:26:38,777 --> 01:26:41,613
How's about I call corporate
and tell them what a disgusting

1766
01:26:41,697 --> 01:26:46,284
excuse for a man you are
and demand that you be fired immediately?

1767
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:50,455
No, not because I want your job
or a promotion.

1768
01:26:50,956 --> 01:26:54,876
Because I want you to know
that if you behave like a pig,

1769
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:56,962
you deserve to get stuck like one.

1770
01:27:00,841 --> 01:27:04,136
- Wow!
- Sixty-one yards.

1771
01:27:04,219 --> 01:27:07,431
New Mexico High School state record,
boy or girl.

1772
01:27:07,514 --> 01:27:09,683
I'll make it up.

1773
01:27:09,766 --> 01:27:12,519
Let me just get my head together,
and we'll talk about it, all right?

1774
01:27:13,186 --> 01:27:14,354
Hey!

1775
01:27:14,438 --> 01:27:16,940
Somebody get my dick for me there, huh?
A little help?

1776
01:27:20,861 --> 01:27:22,487
- Where's Erma?
- She's gone.

1777
01:27:22,571 --> 01:27:24,030
What, you didn't grab any money?

1778
01:27:24,114 --> 01:27:25,114
No, I just want...

1779
01:27:26,199 --> 01:27:27,659
Get this thing in the air already.

1780
01:27:27,743 --> 01:27:30,829
Okay, but I haven't actually
technically flown this type of...

1781
01:27:30,912 --> 01:27:32,497
Alan, helicopter, air, now!

1782
01:27:32,581 --> 01:27:34,458
I'm not the one that shot the pilot!

1783
01:27:51,016 --> 01:27:53,477
- Hey!
- Wait!

1784
01:27:53,977 --> 01:27:57,481
Why are their pockets inside out?
Why are their pockets inside out?!

1785
01:27:58,398 --> 01:28:00,692
We're the waiters from before!

1786
01:28:00,776 --> 01:28:02,319
We want to buy the Bey back!

1787
01:28:02,402 --> 01:28:05,155
Please, we got all your money, look!
You can have it all!

1788
01:28:07,032 --> 01:28:08,575
We just want the Bey!

1789
01:28:08,658 --> 01:28:11,453
If I give you the Bey,
they shoot me out of the sky.

1790
01:28:11,536 --> 01:28:15,081
We brought an empty bag!
The Bey can just climb inside!

1791
01:28:15,165 --> 01:28:15,999
What?

1792
01:28:16,082 --> 01:28:18,919
They'll never know
that he left the helicopter,

1793
01:28:19,002 --> 01:28:20,545
and you get all your money!

1794
01:28:22,672 --> 01:28:23,965
Okay! Hurry!

1795
01:28:26,635 --> 01:28:27,886
Goddamn.

1796
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:29,554
Get in. Come on.

1797
01:28:29,638 --> 01:28:31,890
Look, I'm saving you, dude.
I'm saving you.

1798
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:33,058
Shut the fuck up.

1799
01:28:34,643 --> 01:28:36,186
You fucking asshole!

1800
01:28:36,269 --> 01:28:37,729
I will fucking kill you, dog!

1801
01:28:37,813 --> 01:28:40,357
- Don't you fucking close that...
- Let's get him out of here.

1802
01:28:41,358 --> 01:28:43,193
- All right, you got all the money.
- Right.

1803
01:28:43,276 --> 01:28:44,756
Thanks. You're not gonna regret this.

1804
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:47,197
Let's make sure of that.

1805
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:48,490
Oh!

1806
01:28:50,492 --> 01:28:51,493
Jesus.

1807
01:28:52,661 --> 01:28:54,955
- Get rid of him.
- Goddamn it.

1808
01:28:56,039 --> 01:28:58,208
Alan, let's go.

1809
01:29:01,253 --> 01:29:02,337
Open it up!

1810
01:29:05,173 --> 01:29:06,007
Come on, open it.

1811
01:29:06,091 --> 01:29:07,759
He's alive.

1812
01:29:07,843 --> 01:29:09,761
- Oh, my God! Oh, shit!
- Are you okay?

1813
01:29:09,845 --> 01:29:11,596
Fuck, that motherfucker shot me!

1814
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:13,974
I can't believe he's getting away
with this shit!

1815
01:29:14,057 --> 01:29:16,434
He's not. Watch this shit.

1816
01:29:17,185 --> 01:29:18,185
Cassie.

1817
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:20,438
Time to let the dogs out.

1818
01:29:21,022 --> 01:29:22,524
Over. You gotta say "over."

1819
01:29:22,607 --> 01:29:25,443
Okay, everybody, that's it!
Let's go! Let's go!

1820
01:29:25,527 --> 01:29:26,987
Let's go!

1821
01:29:28,697 --> 01:29:29,948
Faster!

1822
01:29:42,961 --> 01:29:43,961
No.

1823
01:29:45,005 --> 01:29:46,214
No!

1824
01:29:48,925 --> 01:29:50,885
It worked!

1825
01:29:50,969 --> 01:29:52,887
He fucking blew up.

1826
01:29:52,971 --> 01:29:55,682
Yes!
Oh, man. It's kind of fun being badass.

1827
01:29:55,765 --> 01:29:57,892
Yeah, yeah, it is, uh, pretty exciting.

1828
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:01,688
- I told you guys.
- You did.

1829
01:30:01,771 --> 01:30:03,982
You did, man. I'm sorry I doubted you.

1830
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:08,486
- Get me to a fucking hospital!
- Yep, okay.

1831
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:09,570
Dumb fucks!

1832
01:30:16,453 --> 01:30:17,662
Okay, so, you know,

1833
01:30:17,746 --> 01:30:19,956
we'll start working
on the Skintendo Joysuit right away

1834
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:21,291
and then keep you in the loop.

1835
01:30:21,374 --> 01:30:23,251
Yeah, and we are going to need
another check.

1836
01:30:23,335 --> 01:30:24,169
Yeah.

1837
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:26,052
Our lives are in a pretty bad place
right now,

1838
01:30:26,129 --> 01:30:28,049
and that check is gonna
change our lives forever.

1839
01:30:28,131 --> 01:30:30,771
Fuck are you talking about?
I'm not writing you guys another check.

1840
01:30:30,842 --> 01:30:32,636
Hold on. Wait one second.

1841
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:35,221
Why aren't you gonna...
Oh, he's concussed, right?

1842
01:30:35,305 --> 01:30:38,025
He's got something up with his brain?
Is it jiggling around in there?

1843
01:30:38,058 --> 01:30:41,519
Bitch, the only reason I wrote that check
was to piss off Ahmad,

1844
01:30:41,603 --> 01:30:44,981
'cause that shit made me laugh.

1845
01:30:46,858 --> 01:30:47,984
Oh, my tummy.

1846
01:30:49,361 --> 01:30:50,945
Get me the fuck up out of here.

1847
01:30:51,029 --> 01:30:52,113
Come on.

1848
01:30:52,197 --> 01:30:54,824
And play with my balls.
Make sure my dick still works.

1849
01:30:54,908 --> 01:30:57,708
I do not get that. He seemed like
such a stand-up guy on the Instagram.

1850
01:30:57,786 --> 01:30:59,138
- He's an asshole.
- Piece of shit.

1851
01:30:59,162 --> 01:31:01,539
Excuse me.
Hey, guys, um, I'm Mark Cuban.

1852
01:31:01,623 --> 01:31:03,667
I'm a friend of the Bey's.
I was up there tonight.

1853
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:06,127
- I saw you guys had that bodysuit thing.
- Yeah.

1854
01:31:06,211 --> 01:31:07,253
Holy fuckin' shit!

1855
01:31:07,337 --> 01:31:10,590
Oh, yeah, yup, we're gettin' Shark Tanked.

1856
01:31:10,674 --> 01:31:13,468
Mark Cuban wants to buy
the Skintendo Joysuit!

1857
01:31:13,551 --> 01:31:15,595
Skintendo Joysuit?
That's what you named it?

1858
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:17,681
- Yeah, I named it.
- Good name, right?

1859
01:31:17,764 --> 01:31:20,350
That's bad. No.
I'm definitely not interested.

1860
01:31:20,433 --> 01:31:25,105
However, what you just went through
tonight was pretty hard-core.

1861
01:31:25,188 --> 01:31:28,066
I'd like to buy your story,
turn it into a video game

1862
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:29,651
starring you guys,

1863
01:31:29,734 --> 01:31:33,154
voiced over and visually modeled
after famous actors, of course.

1864
01:31:33,238 --> 01:31:35,216
- I call Sean Astin.
- Mark-Paul Gosselaar, please!

1865
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:37,617
Uh, Cara Delevingne. I don't know.

1866
01:31:37,701 --> 01:31:39,141
- Whoever we can get.
- I don't know.

1867
01:31:39,202 --> 01:31:41,389
- All right, guys.
- Awesome. Thank you so much.

1868
01:31:41,413 --> 01:31:42,893
Oh, he even walks cool. Sick blanket.

1869
01:31:42,956 --> 01:31:44,436
- See you, Marky Cubes.
- Ring-a-ling.

1870
01:31:44,749 --> 01:31:45,829
- Sweet.
- That was awesome!

1871
01:31:45,875 --> 01:31:46,960
That's funny. Wow.

1872
01:32:02,642 --> 01:32:04,936
Announcement! Announcement!
Shut... shut up.

1873
01:32:05,019 --> 01:32:07,147
Shut up real quick.
I'm gonna make an announcement.

1874
01:32:07,230 --> 01:32:08,732
Hey, look. Now, I know

1875
01:32:08,815 --> 01:32:13,570
we are the millionaire video game mavens
that chartered this Costa Rica cruise

1876
01:32:13,653 --> 01:32:15,822
for 100 of our closest friends, yes,

1877
01:32:15,905 --> 01:32:19,325
but I wanna congratulate you guys
for having...

1878
01:32:19,409 --> 01:32:22,287
the best butt-cheeks in the business!

1879
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:23,538
You guys are hot as fuck.

1880
01:32:23,621 --> 01:32:25,790
And shake 'em if you got 'em!

1881
01:32:25,874 --> 01:32:27,584
Whoa!

1882
01:32:29,335 --> 01:32:31,421
Dinner bell's ringing.
Come and get it, boys.

1883
01:32:31,504 --> 01:32:35,884
- Come and get it, huh?
- Joel, I am so proud of you, dude.

1884
01:32:36,301 --> 01:32:37,802
Not a day goes by that I miss

1885
01:32:37,886 --> 01:32:41,264
that shy, closeted bitch
that you once were, and I mean that.

1886
01:32:41,681 --> 01:32:43,516
- Thanks, man.
- And Darren?

1887
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:46,160
I am beyond thrilled that you are
no longer a controlling asshole

1888
01:32:46,186 --> 01:32:49,147
who needs to smoke salvia just to get by.

1889
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:51,065
Haven't touched the stuff
since that night.

1890
01:32:51,149 --> 01:32:52,525
- Good.
- You know that.

1891
01:32:52,609 --> 01:32:54,235
Yeah.

1892
01:32:54,319 --> 01:32:57,197
Just, uh, doing cocaine now, you know.
But for fun.

1893
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:58,823
It's better for you.

1894
01:32:58,907 --> 01:33:01,367
Ah! This is the best, guys.

1895
01:33:01,451 --> 01:33:03,953
Look at us.
Rich beyond our wildest dreams.

1896
01:33:04,037 --> 01:33:06,206
- Darren doing cocaine for fun.
- Shh.

1897
01:33:06,289 --> 01:33:09,292
Joel is, like, fricking wiggling
his dick around, just begging for cock.

1898
01:33:09,375 --> 01:33:11,586
Hey, I'm not... I'm not begging yet.

1899
01:33:12,670 --> 01:33:15,590
Oh! Darren, tell Alexxx
about that video game idea.

1900
01:33:15,673 --> 01:33:17,467
Oh, yeah. Okay.

1901
01:33:17,550 --> 01:33:18,802
New idea, new game:

1902
01:33:19,302 --> 01:33:22,055
leprechauns... but they're tall.

1903
01:33:22,931 --> 01:33:24,808
Oh, that is a clever twist.

1904
01:33:26,184 --> 01:33:29,729
No. Nope.
I'm not all about making money anymore.

1905
01:33:29,813 --> 01:33:32,398
You know what I'm about? Best friends.

1906
01:33:33,566 --> 01:33:34,734
Put your hands in.

1907
01:33:36,528 --> 01:33:38,947
Dew'd Crew!

1909
01:33:41,074 --> 01:33:43,326
Yes! We're gonna live forever!

1910
01:33:43,409 --> 01:33:45,119
