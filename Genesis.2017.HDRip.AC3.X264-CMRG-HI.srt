[Alexa] McMan status report.

00:00:39,137 --> 00:00:42,973
McMan do you copy?

00:00:42,975 --> 00:00:47,146
Broadman is the long range
comms repair complete?

5
00:00:48,045 --> 00:00:49,314
Broadman, McMan do you copy?

6
00:00:52,084 --> 00:00:53,049
Come in.

10
00:01:02,628 --> 00:01:04,260
Return to Eden.

(dramatic music)

12
00:01:13,772 --> 00:01:15,871
Come in, return to Eden now...

13
00:01:15,873 --> 00:01:17,176
[Frost] Why
can't we hear them?

I don't know.

[Paul] Paul Brooks
journal day 518.

43
00:03:50,929 --> 00:03:52,161
It was once said
that those suffering

44
00:03:52,163 --> 00:03:55,264
from the incapacity to
love are living in hell.

45
00:03:55,266 --> 00:03:58,802
I often wonder if Dostoevsky
wanted to say more

46
00:03:58,804 --> 00:04:01,237
because what I know
of hell isn't simply

47
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:04,107
a place where love
doesn't exist.

48
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:07,376
Nor is it a place
you go when you die.

49
00:04:07,378 --> 00:04:09,578
Hell is here in this facility.

50
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:14,383
In the body and in the
mind, hell is a battle

51
00:04:14,385 --> 00:04:17,152
you know you will one day lose.

52
00:04:17,154 --> 00:04:19,389
It's waking up every
morning with the very

53
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:22,425
real threat that it
could be your last.

54
00:04:22,427 --> 00:04:24,961
It's watching other
human beings starve.

55
00:04:24,963 --> 00:04:28,234
While those with the
means ignore them.

56
00:04:29,401 --> 00:04:32,334
It's placing the
hope for humanity

57
00:04:32,336 --> 00:04:35,938
on artificial intelligence.

58
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,541
It's having a daughter you
don't recognize anymore

59
00:04:39,543 --> 00:04:43,613
and who doesn't
recognize you anymore.

60
00:04:43,615 --> 00:04:46,048
Hell is what the East
inflicted on us two years ago

61
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,618
when they pushed the
button on day zero.

62
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,355
And now as our food supplies
run drastically low,

63
00:04:52,357 --> 00:04:54,457
our friends and
families forced into

64
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:58,560
punishment details with
substandard equipment.

65
00:04:58,562 --> 00:05:00,430
Our continued attempts
to communicate

66
00:05:00,432 --> 00:05:02,298
with other facilities failing.

67
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,399
Hell is creeping in
to the collective

68
00:05:04,401 --> 00:05:06,435
conscious of those that remain.

69
00:05:06,437 --> 00:05:10,572
The reason and rational
is all but depleted.

70
00:05:10,574 --> 00:05:12,408
I wish I knew what
the future holds

71
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,980
but that would mean believing
that there is a future.

72
00:05:16,247 --> 00:05:19,082
I don't know how much
longer we have left.

73
00:05:19,084 --> 00:05:21,821
(dramatic music)

74
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,531

75
00:05:47,077 --> 00:05:49,314
[Computer] Access denied.

78
00:06:04,596 --> 00:06:06,632
Decontamination complete.

79
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,372
Airlock pressurized.

80
00:06:14,706 --> 00:06:16,075
Entry secured.

81
00:06:17,675 --> 00:06:18,574
[Frost] Whoa whoa whoa whoa.

82
00:06:18,576 --> 00:06:20,310
Broadman are you okay?

83
00:06:20,312 --> 00:06:21,310
[Broadman] McMan
got caught in the fog.

84
00:06:21,312 --> 00:06:23,980
He's still out there, save him.

85
00:06:23,982 --> 00:06:27,115
[Frost] It's too late
Broadman, it's too late.

86
00:06:27,117 --> 00:06:28,620
Let's just get you to Medicon.

87
00:06:32,156 --> 00:06:35,358
(dramatic music)

88
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,394
[Broadman] What will
your father make of this?

89
00:06:38,396 --> 00:06:39,598
He could have saved him.

90
00:06:41,665 --> 00:06:43,699
[Alexa] We don't know that.

91
00:06:43,701 --> 00:06:44,637
[Broadman] Don't we?

92
00:06:46,637 --> 00:06:51,009
[Computer] Good morning Eden
this is day zero minus 364.

93
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,211
Pollution and radiation
levels remain constant.

94
00:06:56,213 --> 00:06:59,147
No other survivors
have been located.

95
00:06:59,149 --> 00:07:01,986
Standby for the President's
daily announcement.

96
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:05,320
[President] While we
continue to work tirelessly

97
00:07:05,322 --> 00:07:07,990
to reach other
groups of survivors

98
00:07:07,992 --> 00:07:10,159
due to food shortages
every citizen

99
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:12,964
will be on three quarter
rations as of today.

100
00:07:14,264 --> 00:07:16,968
Remember this is for your
own safety and well being.

101
00:07:25,744 --> 00:07:27,642
I was out there
too long wasn't I?

102
00:07:27,644 --> 00:07:30,048
That's for Dr. Macdonald
to assess and not me.

103
00:07:32,283 --> 00:07:35,050
Broadman late back from
punishment detail doctor.

104
00:07:35,052 --> 00:07:36,051
How long was he exposed?

105
00:07:36,053 --> 00:07:37,155
About three minutes.

106
00:07:39,557 --> 00:07:41,289
Fair amount of time then.

107
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:44,963
Do you want to get on the bed?

108
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,365
[Computer] Bioscan activated.

109
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:51,534
- Subject Broadman, Richard.
- How's she getting along?

110
00:07:51,536 --> 00:07:54,670
You know her, never
sleeps never eats.

111
00:07:54,672 --> 00:07:59,044
All she does is work
on him, our last hope.

112
00:08:02,814 --> 00:08:06,051
(contemplative music)

113
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:16,294
[Computer] Mark III full
system update complete.

114
00:08:19,163 --> 00:08:20,665
Endermic layer
fusion successful.

115
00:08:23,468 --> 00:08:26,235
[Abel] It is complete?

116
00:08:26,237 --> 00:08:28,674
All the data indicates
a successful procedure.

117
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,108
[Abel] Then I'm
ready for the outside?

118
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,477
I still have to
complete the tests.

119
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,314
The tests?

120
00:08:36,246 --> 00:08:38,113
Surely they're a formality.

121
00:08:38,115 --> 00:08:39,016
Not necessarily.

122
00:08:41,619 --> 00:08:43,721
All I long for is
the world outside Eve.

123
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,089
Isn't that what you made me for?

124
00:08:47,091 --> 00:08:49,224
Isn't that where I need to
be to fulfill my purpose?

125
00:08:49,226 --> 00:08:50,728
The world outside has changed.

126
00:08:51,729 --> 00:08:54,229
It now holds many unknowns.

127
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:57,099
It's all too
perhaps distressing.

128
00:08:57,101 --> 00:08:58,667
Of course it does.

129
00:08:58,669 --> 00:09:02,140
Distress is after all
the essence of evolution.

130
00:09:03,341 --> 00:09:06,209
Which is why I hope
survival lies with you.

131
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:08,511
An objective I'm
all too aware of.

132
00:09:08,513 --> 00:09:10,412
[Smith] How's the
new thermal skin Abel?

133
00:09:10,414 --> 00:09:14,217
It itches, like
woolen clothes.

134
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:16,185
Sensory data banks being
put to good use I see.

135
00:09:16,187 --> 00:09:18,454
It certainly
adds another layer.

136
00:09:18,456 --> 00:09:19,689
Think I may know
why your old skin

137
00:09:19,691 --> 00:09:21,692
failed to bind to
your exoskeleton Abel.

138
00:09:25,163 --> 00:09:27,296
Organic contamination.

139
00:09:27,298 --> 00:09:28,830
[Computer] Organic
matter detected.

140
00:09:28,832 --> 00:09:30,201
Biovault purge activated.

141
00:09:34,538 --> 00:09:35,704
Too much human DNA
in the composite.

142
00:09:35,706 --> 00:09:36,906
[Computer] Biovault
purge complete.

143
00:09:36,908 --> 00:09:40,843
I must say the new
compound certainly looks

144
00:09:40,845 --> 00:09:43,845
more resilient and
the good news is

145
00:09:43,847 --> 00:09:46,214
it'll repel
atmospheric pollution.

146
00:09:46,216 --> 00:09:49,484
Practicality should always
come before vanity Dr. Smith.

147
00:09:49,486 --> 00:09:51,320
Down here it should.

148
00:09:51,322 --> 00:09:54,257
Now what about the
combat simulations?

149
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:55,594
Would you like to see
what I've learned today?

150
00:10:05,669 --> 00:10:08,372
Now Abel I'd like you
to talk to me about these.

151
00:10:09,374 --> 00:10:11,940
I must admit I'm
confused as to why

152
00:10:11,942 --> 00:10:13,644
I would need such a skill set.

153
00:10:14,312 --> 00:10:17,316
Both the President and
the board requested it.

154
00:10:17,682 --> 00:10:20,348
But I can see that you
don't agree with them.

155
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:22,450
Hasn't the world
seen enough conflict?

156
00:10:22,452 --> 00:10:24,487
But you can choose Eve.

157
00:10:24,489 --> 00:10:26,289
You did not have to upload the
data if you did not want to.

158
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:31,560
Perhaps not but the
ability to handle danger

159
00:10:31,562 --> 00:10:34,399
is an essential component
of being able to survive.

160
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:40,268
This is one battle
not worth fighting.

161
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,372
I wonder which ones are.

162
00:10:44,475 --> 00:10:46,709
[Computer] Standby
for the President.

163
00:10:46,711 --> 00:10:48,344
[President] Citizens of Eden

164
00:10:48,346 --> 00:10:49,681
this is a general announcement.

165
00:10:51,316 --> 00:10:53,886
Remember punishment details
are necessary for order.

166
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,389
Eden is working
for your survival.

167
00:11:06,697 --> 00:11:07,466
Dad.

168
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:10,368
Dad?

169
00:11:11,903 --> 00:11:12,738
Steven.

170
00:11:15,974 --> 00:11:16,807
Steven?

171
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,041
Where's Dad?

172
00:11:19,043 --> 00:11:21,377
[President] Citizens of
Eden this is the President.

173
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:24,313
We're commencing a level
four shut down test.

174
00:11:24,315 --> 00:11:26,983
This is for your own
safety and well being.

175
00:11:26,985 --> 00:11:28,316
Thank you for your cooperation.

176
00:11:28,318 --> 00:11:29,819
[Steven] It's
practically every day.

177
00:11:29,821 --> 00:11:32,824
[President] Remember Eden
is working for your survival.

178
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:37,362
Well it's time for my
shift in the dungeon.

179
00:11:41,966 --> 00:11:44,267
Your father's over by
the rationing station.

180
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:46,035
Hughes lost it earlier.

181
00:11:46,037 --> 00:11:47,270
[Jim] Fuck you asshole.

182
00:11:47,272 --> 00:11:48,503
- This is mine.
- Fuck you.

183
00:11:48,505 --> 00:11:51,273
(all shouting at once)

184
00:11:51,275 --> 00:11:52,276
Enough!

185
00:11:54,445 --> 00:11:55,276
I'm not having
punishment details

186
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:57,546
handed out left, right
and centre.

187
00:11:57,548 --> 00:11:58,881
It's the law Brooks, if they...

188
00:11:58,883 --> 00:12:00,348
Hey sweetheart.

189
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:03,853
Yeah it's just a
minor disagreement.

190
00:12:03,855 --> 00:12:07,323
Brooks they break the rules
then we don't have a choice.

191
00:12:07,325 --> 00:12:09,458
You think I like
giving out PD's?

192
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,962
It's my job to uphold the
law and maintain order.

193
00:12:12,964 --> 00:12:14,763
Law, you think
this is lawfulness?

194
00:12:14,765 --> 00:12:16,431
Have a look around
you, what do you see?

195
00:12:16,433 --> 00:12:17,900
Do you see humanity or
do you see human beings?

196
00:12:17,902 --> 00:12:19,334
I am not having this
discussion with you again.

197
00:12:19,336 --> 00:12:21,369
This is not a discussion.

198
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:23,772
This is our life,
this is our reality.

199
00:12:23,774 --> 00:12:24,674
Our food rations
are getting smaller.

200
00:12:24,676 --> 00:12:28,477
Our access to clean
water is limited.

201
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:29,712
The people in Civie are sick.

202
00:12:29,714 --> 00:12:33,752
They are sick and hungry and
tired, tired of all the lies.

203
00:12:34,418 --> 00:12:35,950
Well it's the
same for everyone.

204
00:12:35,952 --> 00:12:36,819
It's not.

205
00:12:36,821 --> 00:12:38,054
We know the kind of luxury

206
00:12:38,056 --> 00:12:38,988
the President and
his cronies live in.

207
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,523
He can do something
if he really wanted.

208
00:12:41,525 --> 00:12:43,693
Really what do you suggest?

209
00:12:43,695 --> 00:12:44,893
Tell the truth.

210
00:12:44,895 --> 00:12:46,497
Tell us what happened to Gilead.

211
00:12:47,932 --> 00:12:49,732
Let us go and search for it.

212
00:12:49,734 --> 00:12:53,905
The survival of the
Gilead citadel is a myth.

213
00:12:54,871 --> 00:12:56,339
How can you be
certain of that?

214
00:12:56,341 --> 00:12:57,506
There might still
be people there.

215
00:12:57,508 --> 00:12:58,206
They're could
possibly even be food.

216
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,574
Why does the President feel that

217
00:12:59,576 --> 00:13:00,975
it's not worth
giving us that hope?

218
00:13:00,977 --> 00:13:02,545
I can't speak
for the President.

219
00:13:02,547 --> 00:13:03,548
No evidently not.

220
00:13:07,118 --> 00:13:09,852
Triple detail for Cooper
and a single for Hughes.

221
00:13:09,854 --> 00:13:10,786
Jesus.

222
00:13:10,788 --> 00:13:11,686
I don't have a choice Hughes.

223
00:13:11,688 --> 00:13:12,591
Bollocks.

224
00:13:13,957 --> 00:13:17,328
(all talking at once)

225
00:13:22,033 --> 00:13:23,534
Hey you alright?

226
00:13:25,068 --> 00:13:26,134
McMan didn't make it.

227
00:13:26,136 --> 00:13:27,405
And Broadman's late back.

228
00:13:30,006 --> 00:13:31,040
There was nothing I could do.

229
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:33,575
There's always something
that could be done.

230
00:13:33,577 --> 00:13:34,977
Like what?

231
00:13:34,979 --> 00:13:35,810
He could have said something.

232
00:13:35,812 --> 00:13:37,079
He did.

233
00:13:37,081 --> 00:13:38,848
There are peoples
lives he could save.

234
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,749
[Alexa] He tried Dad.

235
00:13:40,751 --> 00:13:42,450
I just don't want you
to misplace your faith.

236
00:13:42,452 --> 00:13:43,621
He's on the other side.

237
00:13:44,956 --> 00:13:47,558
(somber music)

238
00:13:49,894 --> 00:13:50,825
Where are you going?

239
00:13:50,827 --> 00:13:53,464
I need to get back to Comm.

240
00:13:55,066 --> 00:13:56,535
I was just...

241
00:14:04,942 --> 00:14:07,812
(laser gun firing)

242
00:14:15,452 --> 00:14:16,651
Would you like me to continue?

243
00:14:16,653 --> 00:14:17,722
Absolutely.

244
00:14:18,789 --> 00:14:20,555
I could watch this all day.

245
00:14:20,557 --> 00:14:22,525
I didn't hear you enter.

246
00:14:22,527 --> 00:14:23,392
President Pope is the elected

247
00:14:23,394 --> 00:14:25,694
Commander in Chief
of this facility.

248
00:14:25,696 --> 00:14:27,162
He will come and
go as he pleases.

249
00:14:27,164 --> 00:14:30,065
And does that privilege
extend to his lap dog?

250
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:32,501
My apologies Doctor
you're quite right.

251
00:14:32,503 --> 00:14:35,137
I should have sent word
but I was preoccupied

252
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:37,709
with a situation regarding
the communication zone.

253
00:14:39,143 --> 00:14:41,509
Speaking of which what's
the prognosis on Broadman?

254
00:14:41,511 --> 00:14:44,713
Anti-toxin doses,
50/50 chance sir.

255
00:14:44,715 --> 00:14:47,616
Right and the true prognosis?

256
00:14:47,618 --> 00:14:49,618
He'll be dead in a day or two.

257
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,858
This on the other
hand is very impressive.

258
00:14:54,158 --> 00:14:56,595
The way he looks, amazing.

259
00:14:57,828 --> 00:14:59,964
Is his likeness to
Robert intentional?

260
00:15:03,134 --> 00:15:05,700
I take it this new
skin will make him

261
00:15:05,702 --> 00:15:08,838
completely impervious to
the atmosphere outside.

262
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,076
Made of the same
composite as his jumpsuit.

263
00:15:12,876 --> 00:15:15,045
It's a pity he wasn't
ready earlier then.

264
00:15:16,614 --> 00:15:18,513
We could have avoided
McMan's regrettable demise.

265
00:15:18,515 --> 00:15:21,749
Abel will put a stop to
such things happening again.

266
00:15:21,751 --> 00:15:24,652
He was built to make
the right choices

267
00:15:24,654 --> 00:15:26,158
to serve and protect human kind.

268
00:15:28,658 --> 00:15:31,727
His combat skills seem
very sharp Dr. Gabriel.

269
00:15:31,729 --> 00:15:32,661
How strong is he?

270
00:15:32,663 --> 00:15:35,664
As requested we
structured a reactive

271
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,569
hypertension in all
his nerve endings.

272
00:15:38,836 --> 00:15:40,502
It means in the
event of danger he'll

273
00:15:40,504 --> 00:15:42,938
be able to respond
faster, stronger,

274
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,672
better than any human being.

275
00:15:44,674 --> 00:15:45,709
Really?

276
00:15:47,845 --> 00:15:50,849
Mark III destroy that weapon.

277
00:15:59,123 --> 00:15:59,958
Excellent.

278
00:16:00,991 --> 00:16:03,658
And his knowledge data base?

279
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,694
Ask him any question you like.

280
00:16:05,696 --> 00:16:09,531
Mark III when I mention
day zero what do I mean?

281
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:10,632
Would you like
the short version

282
00:16:10,634 --> 00:16:12,535
or the detailed
version Mr. President?

283
00:16:12,537 --> 00:16:14,570
Time is of the
essence these days.

284
00:16:14,572 --> 00:16:18,306
Day zero, Friday
September 12, 2042 AD

285
00:16:18,308 --> 00:16:20,542
when the politburo of The
Democratic Peoples Republic

286
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:23,244
of Eastern Autonomous
States launched a global

287
00:16:23,246 --> 00:16:26,281
chemical strike in response
to Western Coalition attempt

288
00:16:26,283 --> 00:16:28,651
to implement insurgency among
the oppressed population

289
00:16:28,653 --> 00:16:31,990
of the regime resulting in a
near extinction of mankind.

290
00:16:32,923 --> 00:16:33,924
Very good doctor.

291
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:36,560
Very good.

292
00:16:40,664 --> 00:16:43,831
Mark III how many functioning
lights are there in Eden?

293
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,633
346.

294
00:16:45,635 --> 00:16:46,969
Firearms?

295
00:16:46,971 --> 00:16:50,605
97 automatic and semiautomatic
rifles, 22 handguns.

296
00:16:50,607 --> 00:16:51,674
Women?

297
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:52,307
47.

298
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:53,342
Military?

299
00:16:53,344 --> 00:16:54,175
Three.

300
00:16:54,177 --> 00:16:55,076
Presidents?

301
00:16:55,078 --> 00:16:55,913
One.

302
00:16:58,249 --> 00:16:58,914
Outstanding.

303
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,715
Outstanding.

304
00:17:00,717 --> 00:17:02,987
Mark III who is
Robert Gabriel?

305
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,854
Doctor Robert Gabriel
biorobotics pioneer

306
00:17:06,856 --> 00:17:10,692
and creator of the Mark I
and Mark II, my predecessors.

307
00:17:10,694 --> 00:17:11,663
He is now deceased.

308
00:17:14,898 --> 00:17:16,632
Anything else?

309
00:17:16,634 --> 00:17:19,234
I don't understand the
question Secretary Ainsley.

310
00:17:19,236 --> 00:17:21,840
[Ainsley] He was Doctor
Eve Gabriel's husband yes?

311
00:17:23,807 --> 00:17:25,274
That is correct.

312
00:17:25,276 --> 00:17:26,976
But I still don't understand.

313
00:17:26,978 --> 00:17:30,949
Well surely you can tell
me something about him.

314
00:17:31,816 --> 00:17:33,681
What about the way he looked?

315
00:17:33,683 --> 00:17:35,950
I'm afraid there are no
pictures in my database.

316
00:17:35,952 --> 00:17:38,088
No pictures well
that's interesting.

317
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:40,922
What are you doing Ainsley?

318
00:17:40,924 --> 00:17:42,123
I'm merely trying to establish

319
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:45,361
his basic abilities to think
beyond the rational answer.

320
00:17:45,363 --> 00:17:46,661
He surpassed the constraints

321
00:17:46,663 --> 00:17:48,363
of the churring test long ago.

322
00:17:48,365 --> 00:17:51,232
Machines have proved
their ability to display

323
00:17:51,234 --> 00:17:54,004
the illusion of consciousness
for years now Doctor.

324
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:57,142
We wanted a machine with
ethical judgment as well.

325
00:17:58,742 --> 00:18:01,744
I think in know where Secretary
Ainsley is going with this.

326
00:18:01,746 --> 00:18:03,778
A hypothetical question
for you Mark III.

327
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,046
I prefer Abel.

328
00:18:05,048 --> 00:18:08,083
Mark III you discover
a 20 kilogram container

329
00:18:08,085 --> 00:18:12,054
full of antibiotics, food, and
vitamins in the wastelands.

330
00:18:12,056 --> 00:18:14,690
Next to it is a badly
inured Doctor Eve Gabriel.

331
00:18:14,692 --> 00:18:15,725
[Eve] This is...

332
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:20,062
And you can only return
one of them to Eden.

333
00:18:20,064 --> 00:18:21,330
Which one do you choose?

334
00:18:21,332 --> 00:18:22,133
I choose Eve.

335
00:18:24,268 --> 00:18:26,969
Even though the antibiotics
could save countless lives?

336
00:18:26,971 --> 00:18:28,006
Yes.

337
00:18:29,306 --> 00:18:32,341
Eve is the key to the
survival of civilization.

338
00:18:32,343 --> 00:18:34,179
No Mark III you are.

339
00:18:41,152 --> 00:18:43,084
[Eve] What do you mean two
more weeks of fine tuning?

340
00:18:43,086 --> 00:18:44,152
[President] I
mean he's not ready.

341
00:18:44,154 --> 00:18:45,286
[Eve] I know his capabilities

342
00:18:45,288 --> 00:18:47,055
and he is ready for the outside.

343
00:18:47,057 --> 00:18:49,123
[Ainsley] Dr. Gabriel that
is the President of Eden.

344
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,759
Eden needs food
and it needs it now.

345
00:18:51,761 --> 00:18:53,796
No one is disputing that.

346
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:54,962
But there's a
basic probably with

347
00:18:54,964 --> 00:18:57,065
the Mark III's ethical makeup.

348
00:18:57,067 --> 00:19:00,369
The machine is, well
it's too human right now.

349
00:19:00,371 --> 00:19:01,402
We built him to spec.

350
00:19:01,404 --> 00:19:02,904
Then change the spec.

351
00:19:02,906 --> 00:19:06,010
I did but he's
creating his own rules.

352
00:19:07,111 --> 00:19:08,913
Think of a game of chess.

353
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,047
There are rules but the
rules don't dictate the game.

354
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:15,150
So what are saying he's
just developed empathy?

355
00:19:15,152 --> 00:19:17,819
Like all lifeforms his
consciousness is evolving.

356
00:19:17,821 --> 00:19:18,656
Lifeform?

357
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:22,190
Dr. Gabriel we
asked for a machine

358
00:19:22,192 --> 00:19:24,058
one that could traverse
the ground beyond the range

359
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,961
of our details and reach
untapped food stores,

360
00:19:26,963 --> 00:19:29,230
a machine that understood
the basic human needs

361
00:19:29,232 --> 00:19:32,066
for survival, a machine
with apt moral judgment.

362
00:19:32,068 --> 00:19:33,835
And won't be able
to achieve that unless

363
00:19:33,837 --> 00:19:36,337
his programming gives him the
capacity for self awareness.

364
00:19:36,339 --> 00:19:37,675
Yes he will.

365
00:19:39,175 --> 00:19:41,211
And I advise you get
back to work doctor.

366
00:19:42,413 --> 00:19:44,915
I don't want a man,
I want a machine.

367
00:19:48,051 --> 00:19:50,518
And preferably one that doesn't
look like your dead husband.

368
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,893
[Computer] Access
granted President Pope.

369
00:19:55,425 --> 00:19:58,262
(contemplative music)

370
00:20:32,028 --> 00:20:32,963
[Alexa] What's wrong?

371
00:20:37,367 --> 00:20:39,567
[Frost] You know I could
have brought him back.

372
00:20:39,569 --> 00:20:42,307
[Alexa] Who McMan?

373
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:47,111
He would have died anyway.

374
00:20:53,384 --> 00:20:55,851
You know I just wish...

375
00:20:55,853 --> 00:20:56,921
You just wish what?

376
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:04,261
There's not much good
left here you know.

377
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:06,931
There is in people like you.

378
00:21:27,384 --> 00:21:29,383
You seemed distressed.

379
00:21:29,385 --> 00:21:30,288
Did I not pass?

380
00:21:31,989 --> 00:21:33,324
[Eve] You did in my eyes.

381
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:36,260
But not in theirs.

382
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,465
Eve.

383
00:21:42,298 --> 00:21:44,632
The decree written up
by the board two weeks

384
00:21:44,634 --> 00:21:47,369
after day zero stated
only five children

385
00:21:47,371 --> 00:21:49,504
are permitted to be
born in Eden each year.

386
00:21:49,506 --> 00:21:50,408
[Eve] That's right.

387
00:21:53,344 --> 00:21:56,181
But there are no children
born here before that day.

388
00:21:59,282 --> 00:22:00,117
Why?

389
00:22:02,486 --> 00:22:05,988
They didn't have time to
go and get their children.

390
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:06,958
Only two made it.

391
00:22:09,192 --> 00:22:10,427
And they died soon after.

392
00:22:13,297 --> 00:22:14,229
[Ainsley] We
should move her off

393
00:22:14,231 --> 00:22:16,465
the project and let
Dr. Smith take over.

394
00:22:16,467 --> 00:22:18,366
Don't be ridiculous.

395
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,635
Smith hasn't half the knowledge.

396
00:22:20,637 --> 00:22:22,336
[Ainsley] She's
uncontrollable.

397
00:22:22,338 --> 00:22:24,472
No one is uncontrollable.

398
00:22:24,474 --> 00:22:26,074
She'll have him
ready in a few days.

399
00:22:26,076 --> 00:22:29,010
Personally I'm concerned
we don't have time James.

400
00:22:29,012 --> 00:22:30,978
Insurgency is at our doorstep.

401
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,948
It's your paranoia
that's at our doorstep.

402
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,982
If we don't send
the Mark III out

403
00:22:34,984 --> 00:22:36,218
to retrieve supplies
soon the civilians

404
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,019
and their leaders
will cause trouble.

405
00:22:38,021 --> 00:22:39,421
They have very little hope left.

406
00:22:39,423 --> 00:22:40,257
Precisely.

407
00:22:41,424 --> 00:22:43,424
The people of Eden
will always obey us

408
00:22:43,426 --> 00:22:44,962
as long as they have some hope,

409
00:22:46,063 --> 00:22:48,066
just not enough to
galvanize their bravery.

410
00:22:54,505 --> 00:22:56,507
You and Robert
never had children.

411
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:00,211
No.

412
00:23:01,412 --> 00:23:02,247
Why?

413
00:23:05,415 --> 00:23:06,049
We were

414
00:23:07,617 --> 00:23:10,251
too busy trying to conquer death

415
00:23:10,253 --> 00:23:12,421
to think about creating life.

416
00:23:12,423 --> 00:23:13,258
Mark I.

417
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:15,660
I see.

418
00:23:16,826 --> 00:23:19,430
Create immortality to dispel
the need for procreation.

419
00:23:21,397 --> 00:23:25,334
Robert believed that
there was no greater

420
00:23:25,336 --> 00:23:28,405
impulse for human kind
than to conquer death.

421
00:23:30,507 --> 00:23:33,411
I cannot understand this
human obsession with death.

422
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:38,582
Would it not be better
to focus on life?

423
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,557
I couldn't have children.

424
00:23:48,325 --> 00:23:51,162
Something I've had to push to
the far reaches of my mind.

425
00:23:57,667 --> 00:23:59,403
Do you miss Robert?

426
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,142
I used to.

427
00:24:08,345 --> 00:24:09,314
But now I have you.

428
00:24:11,647 --> 00:24:14,618
(contemplative music)

429
00:24:55,659 --> 00:24:57,491
I spoke to Gadd.

430
00:24:57,493 --> 00:24:58,328
He's up for it.

431
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:05,699
What did I say, no
what did I tell you?

432
00:25:05,701 --> 00:25:08,670
No, no recruitment drive.

433
00:25:08,672 --> 00:25:09,740
It's not an easy thing.

434
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,044
You don't control wild
animals by arguing nicely.

435
00:25:16,646 --> 00:25:18,546
It takes discipline.

436
00:25:18,548 --> 00:25:20,183
That's why they
need men like us.

437
00:25:22,486 --> 00:25:26,557
Traded these beauties for
that old football of mine.

438
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:29,594
Fancy a game?

439
00:25:30,861 --> 00:25:34,499
Take him to the
fucking cleaners Danny.

440
00:25:35,465 --> 00:25:36,767
Think about what I said Frost.

441
00:25:40,804 --> 00:25:43,104
[Computer] Standby
for the President.

442
00:25:43,106 --> 00:25:43,939
[President] Citizens of Eden

443
00:25:43,941 --> 00:25:46,277
remember lab access
is restricted.

444
00:25:47,743 --> 00:25:51,115
(contemplative music)

445
00:26:22,645 --> 00:26:23,478
[Cain] Is everything clear?

446
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,315
[Gadd] Crystal.

447
00:26:25,883 --> 00:26:29,252
(contemplative music)

448
00:26:33,891 --> 00:26:35,093
[Cain] Don't miss.

449
00:26:38,895 --> 00:26:40,895
(gun cocks)

450
00:26:40,897 --> 00:26:42,132
Nothing comes.

451
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:44,101
Brooks' daughter.

452
00:26:51,407 --> 00:26:53,176
Here's that other
thing you asked for.

453
00:26:55,578 --> 00:26:58,749
(contemplative music)

454
00:27:19,202 --> 00:27:21,969
[Steven] McMan
didn't stand a chance.

455
00:27:21,971 --> 00:27:23,572
We need to insist that
the military suits

456
00:27:23,574 --> 00:27:25,373
are made available
for punishment detail.

457
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:26,210
I'm trying.

458
00:27:27,211 --> 00:27:30,211
Ainsley's not letting
me get to the President.

459
00:27:30,213 --> 00:27:31,182
Then ask Frost.

460
00:27:31,847 --> 00:27:32,948
At least he has a conscious.

461
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,449
I don't trust him.

462
00:27:34,451 --> 00:27:36,250
At least he can
insist that there's

463
00:27:36,252 --> 00:27:38,188
a military presence
in each detail.

464
00:27:41,592 --> 00:27:42,426
Broadman.

465
00:27:58,508 --> 00:28:01,846
(footsteps approaching)

466
00:28:07,718 --> 00:28:09,487
Fancy a bit of
company sweetheart?

467
00:28:10,653 --> 00:28:11,585
Shouldn't you
be harassing some

468
00:28:11,587 --> 00:28:12,923
poor old lady down in Civie?

469
00:28:14,357 --> 00:28:15,757
You know one of these
days you're gonna...

470
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:18,261
(alarm beeps)

471
00:28:19,863 --> 00:28:22,866
(suspenseful music)

472
00:28:25,935 --> 00:28:28,538
Secretary Ainsley I'll
need to speak to you now.

473
00:28:31,708 --> 00:28:34,711
I'm in Comms, you're
gonna want to see this.

474
00:28:37,748 --> 00:28:38,680
(screaming in pain)

475
00:28:38,682 --> 00:28:40,981
Can we get some help in here?

476
00:28:40,983 --> 00:28:43,721
(dramatic music)

477
00:28:45,555 --> 00:28:48,757
Kramer get the morphine,
2000 M's fentanyl quickly.

478
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:50,792
[Computer]
Poisoning is critical.

479
00:28:50,794 --> 00:28:51,963
Possible organ failure.

480
00:28:54,298 --> 00:28:55,330
Is there anything we can do?

481
00:28:55,332 --> 00:28:56,064
No just leave him.

482
00:28:56,066 --> 00:28:57,332
[Computer] Code blue.

483
00:28:57,334 --> 00:28:58,400
Kramer let's go.

in cardiac arrest.

487
00:29:02,306 --> 00:29:03,904
Kramer come on.

488
00:29:03,906 --> 00:29:05,507
[Computer] Internal

(contemplative music)

490
00:29:22,659 --> 00:29:25,329
Frost get Dr. Gabriel to
the war room immediately.

491
00:29:27,364 --> 00:29:31,099
(contemplative music)

492
00:29:31,101 --> 00:29:32,470
[Abel] Why did
they let him die?

493
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:37,037
[Eve] They couldn't stop him.

494
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,041
Couldn't they?

495
00:29:42,511 --> 00:29:43,513
What is it?

496
00:29:43,946 --> 00:29:45,846
War room, right away.

497
00:29:45,848 --> 00:29:48,350
How does that thing shut
down, can you do it quickly?

498
00:29:48,352 --> 00:29:50,721
You go I'll see
to everything here.

499
00:30:02,566 --> 00:30:05,702
[Computer] Mark III
system scan ready.

500
00:30:10,507 --> 00:30:11,472
[President] It's an SOS.

501
00:30:11,474 --> 00:30:12,509
From where?

502
00:30:13,576 --> 00:30:14,508
We don't know.

503
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:15,610
But we have to investigate it.

504
00:30:15,612 --> 00:30:16,811
Lieutenant Frost is already...

505
00:30:16,813 --> 00:30:18,846
The magnetic interference
from the chemical atmosphere

506
00:30:18,848 --> 00:30:21,382
will cause havoc
with navigation.

507
00:30:21,384 --> 00:30:22,717
Deploying Abel
will enable us to...

508
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:25,655
The Mark III is not ready
we've spoken about this.

509
00:30:26,856 --> 00:30:28,555
Lieutenant Frost will
send a civilian on PD

510
00:30:28,557 --> 00:30:29,757
to reconnoiter the coordinates.

511
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:31,625
In the meantime you'll continue
working on your creation.

512
00:30:31,627 --> 00:30:32,626
I personally think that...

513
00:30:32,628 --> 00:30:34,696
Should the source of
the SOS prove genuine

514
00:30:34,698 --> 00:30:37,468
we will revisit whether or
not to deploy the Mark III.

515
00:30:39,135 --> 00:30:41,638
It's the best I can do Doctor.

Get him out.

519
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:02,359

Good man.

Where you're going mate.

539
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,660
You don't know that?

Don't I Paul?

541
00:33:29,972 --> 00:33:30,807
I wrote that.

00:33:33,209 --> 00:33:35,176
Don't think I ever told you.

543
00:33:35,178 --> 00:33:36,013
No you didn't.

544
00:33:37,814 --> 00:33:40,150
However you did say that
you'd never work for them.

545
00:33:41,084 --> 00:33:43,254
Well things change.

546
00:33:44,721 --> 00:33:46,222

He was shot at.

655
00:41:24,547 --> 00:41:29,083
And he's shown that
he's dangerous to humans.

656
00:41:29,085 --> 00:41:31,751
That said maybe we can
turn this into a positive.

657
00:41:31,753 --> 00:41:33,554
Can we communicate with it?

658
00:41:33,556 --> 00:41:35,055
He's disabled his audio feed

659
00:41:35,057 --> 00:41:37,561
but his optical feed is
still fully operational.

660
00:41:39,195 --> 00:41:41,061
Then this is what we'll do.

661
00:41:41,063 --> 00:41:43,165
We send a detail to
retrieve the Mark III.

662
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:48,168
In the meantime we announce
the successful completion

663
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:51,539
of a field test to
recover the body

664
00:41:51,541 --> 00:41:53,773
of our fallen friend,
et cetera et cetera.

665
00:41:53,775 --> 00:41:55,242
Astute as ever sir.

666
00:41:55,244 --> 00:41:57,744
Frost, take Dr.
Smith and one civilian

667
00:41:57,746 --> 00:41:59,847
on punishment detail to
retrieve the Mark III.

668
00:41:59,849 --> 00:42:01,682
Then reconnoiter the
source of the SOS.

669
00:42:01,684 --> 00:42:04,217
I need Dr. Smith
with me to help me

670
00:42:04,219 --> 00:42:05,686
analyze Abel's behavioral code.

671
00:42:05,688 --> 00:42:08,657
Fine, take Dr. Macdonald's
assistant I don't care.

672
00:42:12,427 --> 00:42:14,730
Well you gonna draft
that announcement or not?

673
00:42:16,398 --> 00:42:17,233
Yes sir.

674
00:42:19,635 --> 00:42:22,773
Excuse me. (coughing)

675
00:42:25,541 --> 00:42:27,508
[Computer] Good morning Eden.

676
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:31,148
This is day zero minus 519.

677
00:42:32,347 --> 00:42:35,052
Pollution and radiation
levels remain constant.

678
00:42:36,284 --> 00:42:38,619
No other survivors
have been located.

679
00:42:38,621 --> 00:42:41,688
Stand by for the President's
daily announcement.

680
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:43,826
Something made him leave Pope.

681
00:42:44,827 --> 00:42:46,630
Maybe he thought
this wasn't Eden.

682
00:42:49,664 --> 00:42:51,634
Meaning Robert's laboratory.

683
00:42:54,202 --> 00:42:56,670
You think that Abel
thought this silo was...

684
00:42:56,672 --> 00:42:58,304
What Babel?

685
00:42:58,306 --> 00:42:59,141
It's ridiculous.

686
00:43:00,543 --> 00:43:02,142
Babel and Jericho were
both destroyed on day zero.

687
00:43:02,144 --> 00:43:04,648
It's why we all took refuge
here and he knows that.

688
00:43:05,581 --> 00:43:06,416
No.

689
00:43:07,717 --> 00:43:09,586
Your machine is on
a different mission.

690
00:43:10,887 --> 00:43:12,589
What that is I dread to think.

691
00:43:17,492 --> 00:43:19,526
[Computer] System
link up activated.

692
00:43:19,528 --> 00:43:22,766
Primary weapon
Stevens, King SK56.

693
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,699
Multiple ammunitions loaded.

694
00:43:25,701 --> 00:43:27,233
This is the access
code to my locker.

695
00:43:27,235 --> 00:43:29,702
If anything happens
you get to it.

696
00:43:29,704 --> 00:43:31,304
What do you mean, why?

697
00:43:31,306 --> 00:43:33,240
Just an insurance policy.

698
00:43:33,242 --> 00:43:34,675
Well I don't want
to have to use it.

699
00:43:34,677 --> 00:43:36,844
So just make sure you come back.

700
00:43:36,846 --> 00:43:37,711
[Computer] Kramer, Archibald.

701
00:43:37,713 --> 00:43:39,882
Suit environmental
integrity at 96%.

702
00:43:42,717 --> 00:43:45,888
(contemplative music)

703
00:43:47,856 --> 00:43:49,557
Soon as we're outside
you get back down

704
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:51,858
to Civie and you
keep the peace okay.

705
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:53,262
Don't worry there sir.

706
00:43:54,496 --> 00:43:55,862
I got Walsh here with me.

707
00:43:55,864 --> 00:43:57,766
Nothing we can't handle.

708
00:44:03,972 --> 00:44:05,606
[Computer] Chapman, Cara.

709
00:44:05,608 --> 00:44:07,811
Suit environmental
integrity at 93%.

710
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:12,845
Get yourself down to Civie
I'll be right behind you.

711
00:44:12,847 --> 00:44:17,153
[Computer] Environmental
integrity at 95%.

712
00:44:21,356 --> 00:44:23,759
[Computer] Airlock secured.

713
00:44:28,664 --> 00:44:32,836
Brooks, your father wants
to see you at the level gate.

714
00:44:34,269 --> 00:44:35,739
I'm supervising the sortie.

715
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:41,644
Do as you are told and go now.

716
00:44:47,315 --> 00:44:48,916
Just don't touch anything.

717
00:44:48,918 --> 00:44:50,320
Never learned to type.

718
00:44:53,588 --> 00:44:56,592
(suspenseful music)

719
00:45:04,967 --> 00:45:07,204
(coughing)

720
00:45:15,644 --> 00:45:19,815
The truth is I can't
remember if I did restrain him.

721
00:45:21,384 --> 00:45:22,719
I've isolated the footage.

722
00:45:26,322 --> 00:45:27,356
Memory's a funny thing.

723
00:45:28,623 --> 00:45:29,925
Is it every that reliable?

724
00:45:30,992 --> 00:45:32,626
It has to be.

725
00:45:32,628 --> 00:45:33,730
We should get ready.

726
00:45:34,829 --> 00:45:36,362
Frost and his team
will almost be outside.

727
00:45:36,364 --> 00:45:40,536
Is Robert's laboratory
still out there Albert?

728
00:45:41,637 --> 00:45:43,503
I don't know.

729
00:45:43,505 --> 00:45:46,242
(dramatic music)

730
00:46:00,822 --> 00:46:02,259
Hey dickhead.

731
00:46:03,425 --> 00:46:05,059
(coughing)

732
00:46:05,061 --> 00:46:07,394
Jimenez maybe it's time you get
yourself to the medical bay.

733
00:46:07,396 --> 00:46:08,329
I'll be fine.

734
00:46:08,331 --> 00:46:09,399
[Alexa] Frost it's Brooks.

735
00:46:10,733 --> 00:46:12,032
[Frost] We're at the
gates of Eden Alexa.

736
00:46:12,034 --> 00:46:14,704
Be careful fresh cloud
of pollution is in range.

737
00:46:16,806 --> 00:46:19,005
The detail are positioned
at the gate Dr. Gabriel.

738
00:46:19,007 --> 00:46:20,541
[Eve] Just connecting.

739
00:46:20,543 --> 00:46:23,844
[Computer] Visual
feed disabled.

740
00:46:23,846 --> 00:46:24,880
I don't understand.

741
00:46:27,083 --> 00:46:29,115
Well we know where he's going.

742
00:46:29,117 --> 00:46:32,353
We're sending you the
coordinates now Alexa.

743
00:46:32,355 --> 00:46:34,387
He's heading towards
the beacon signal.

744
00:46:34,389 --> 00:46:35,356
[Alexa] Copy that.

745
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:37,925
Frost pollution levels
are holding for now.

746
00:46:37,927 --> 00:46:39,062
Proceed towards target.

747
00:46:40,061 --> 00:46:42,362
[Computer] System
linkup activated.

748
00:46:42,364 --> 00:46:43,996
Copy that Eden.

749
00:46:43,998 --> 00:46:45,398
[Computer] Frost, Shane.

750
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,934
Environmental biohazard
monitoring enabled.

751
00:46:47,936 --> 00:46:50,604
Okay Chapman, Kramer come on.

752
00:46:50,606 --> 00:46:53,376
(dramatic music)

753
00:47:09,125 --> 00:47:12,561
(all shouting at once)

754
00:47:13,661 --> 00:47:15,461
Are you seeing this?

755
00:47:15,463 --> 00:47:17,965
Did you know about this?

756
00:47:17,967 --> 00:47:21,403
(all shouting at once)

757
00:47:24,806 --> 00:47:25,741
What the?

758
00:47:26,809 --> 00:47:27,644
Mr. Jimenez?

759
00:47:31,414 --> 00:47:33,546
Is that on
throughout the complex?

760
00:47:33,548 --> 00:47:34,416
Just on level four.

761
00:47:35,418 --> 00:47:37,354
What was that?

762
00:47:38,454 --> 00:47:39,787
Is that Dr. Gabriel's machine?

763
00:47:39,789 --> 00:47:41,121
Turn it off now.

764
00:47:41,123 --> 00:47:42,456
Did it kill Cooper?

765
00:47:42,458 --> 00:47:43,456
[Jimenez] Now.

766
00:47:43,458 --> 00:47:46,395
(dramatic music)

767
00:48:01,443 --> 00:48:04,545

768
00:48:04,547 --> 00:48:07,117
(dramatic music)

769
00:48:08,617 --> 00:48:10,083
[Robert] What killed Cooper?

770
00:48:10,085 --> 00:48:12,186
Well first of all that's
what we need to find out right?

771
00:48:12,188 --> 00:48:13,720
This thing needs to be held
accountable for it's actions.

772
00:48:13,722 --> 00:48:15,521
Of course and someone
is in charge of that.

773
00:48:15,523 --> 00:48:16,789
We need to reclaim
our humanity.

774
00:48:16,791 --> 00:48:18,592
Come on this is not
gonna solve anything.

775
00:48:18,594 --> 00:48:20,626
Hughes go back to
your tent and calm down.

776
00:48:20,628 --> 00:48:22,695
We're not a lynch mob alright.

777
00:48:22,697 --> 00:48:25,467
(dramatic music)

778
00:48:35,744 --> 00:48:37,644
We need to find out
what's going on.

779
00:48:37,646 --> 00:48:40,112
Now let me go with Steve and
other members of the council.

780
00:48:40,114 --> 00:48:43,583
I will insist we speak to
the President directly.

781
00:48:43,585 --> 00:48:44,784
See what everybody knows.

782
00:48:44,786 --> 00:48:45,989
So what do we do Paul?

783
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:50,490
Until then we are
on a peaceful protest.

784
00:48:50,492 --> 00:48:53,663
(contemplative music)

785
00:49:07,275 --> 00:49:08,677
[Computer] System failure.

786
00:49:16,552 --> 00:49:20,722
Kramer, Archibald suit
environmental integrity at 88%.

787
00:49:30,766 --> 00:49:32,469
[Chapman] Man at one o'clock.

788
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:37,804
Yeah talk to me Chapman.

789
00:49:37,806 --> 00:49:39,608
[Chapman] I'm sorry sir
they're over the dune.

790
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:42,943
Nobody reports for work.

791
00:49:42,945 --> 00:49:46,914
We stay here in Civie, we
don't show our heads alright

792
00:49:46,916 --> 00:49:49,749
'til I or Steven, other
members of the council say so.

793
00:49:49,751 --> 00:49:52,151
Come on Jim, come on man.

794
00:49:52,153 --> 00:49:53,686
You call that a plan?

795
00:49:53,688 --> 00:49:54,655
It could have been you.

796
00:49:54,657 --> 00:49:56,722
Come on man drop the shank.

797
00:49:56,724 --> 00:49:59,760
It could have been me but
instead it was poor Cooper.

798
00:49:59,762 --> 00:50:00,726
I can't take it anymore.

799
00:50:00,728 --> 00:50:01,862
(all talking at once)

800
00:50:01,864 --> 00:50:02,996
Fucking move!

801
00:50:02,998 --> 00:50:04,097
Somebody stop him.

802
00:50:04,099 --> 00:50:06,870
(dramatic music)

803
00:50:07,168 --> 00:50:08,538
Fucking move!

804
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:12,238
Cain we have a situation
get to the lab immediately.

805
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,675
Frost, Frost come in, over.

806
00:50:14,677 --> 00:50:17,614
(dramatic music)

807
00:50:22,684 --> 00:50:23,916
Where?

808
00:50:23,918 --> 00:50:25,786
Talk to me Chapman where?

809
00:50:25,788 --> 00:50:27,854
(rock thuds)

810
00:50:27,856 --> 00:50:30,627
(dramatic music)

811
00:50:32,894 --> 00:50:37,065
(gun firing)
(dramatic music)

812
00:50:48,844 --> 00:50:49,776
Get the labs locked down.

813
00:50:49,778 --> 00:50:51,043
I'll try and cut them
off on this level.

814
00:50:51,045 --> 00:50:53,146
Come on we can stop this.

815
00:50:53,148 --> 00:50:54,918
[Jimenez] Seal the
doors, priority A.

00:51:14,302 --> 00:51:17,269
[Paul] Come on man forget
it, it's not worth it.

819
00:51:17,271 --> 00:51:19,271
(dramatic music)

820
00:51:19,273 --> 00:51:20,941
(gun firing)

821
00:51:20,943 --> 00:51:24,043
(dramatic music)

822
00:51:24,045 --> 00:51:25,213
We move now.

823
00:51:29,184 --> 00:51:32,355
(all talking at once)

824
00:51:34,657 --> 00:51:37,226
(dramatic music)

825
00:51:39,862 --> 00:51:40,863
Lieutenant.

826
00:51:42,965 --> 00:51:44,063
Put the weapon over the side.

827
00:51:44,065 --> 00:51:45,999
[Paul] Jim let her go
this will get nothing done...

828
00:51:46,001 --> 00:51:47,767
Do as I say or I swear to
fucking God I'll kill her.

829
00:51:47,769 --> 00:51:48,834
- It's not worth it.
- Let's talk Hughes.

830
00:51:48,836 --> 00:51:50,269
I don't want you
dead Lieutenant.

831
00:51:50,271 --> 00:51:51,972
You tell that to Cooper.

832
00:51:51,974 --> 00:51:53,005
That wasn't meant to be.

833
00:51:53,007 --> 00:51:54,173
[Paul] Okay okay okay okay.

834
00:51:54,175 --> 00:51:55,275
[Jim] Do it, do it now.

835
00:51:55,277 --> 00:51:56,878
Calm down, calm down.

836
00:51:58,047 --> 00:52:00,112
Mark III I'm here to retrieve
you and take you back...

837
00:52:00,114 --> 00:52:03,051
I will advise you to cease
your pursuit of me Lieutenant.

838
00:52:04,253 --> 00:52:06,452
I'm capable of things
I have no control over.

839
00:52:06,454 --> 00:52:08,924
(thudding)

840
00:52:11,159 --> 00:52:13,159
[Jim] Side arm as well too.

841
00:52:13,161 --> 00:52:14,396
I'm not fucking joking.

842
00:52:15,697 --> 00:52:16,896
Now let me through.

843
00:52:16,898 --> 00:52:18,398
[Paul] It's not gonna make
anything better let her go.

844
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,231
Just let me through.

845
00:52:19,233 --> 00:52:21,233
- You don't need her.
- No Jim no.

846
00:52:21,235 --> 00:52:23,003
For God's sake man come on.

847
00:52:23,005 --> 00:52:25,008
Take it easy, take it easy.

848
00:52:26,742 --> 00:52:28,275
[Jim] Stop right
fucking there.

849
00:52:28,277 --> 00:52:29,742

855
00:52:44,126 --> 00:52:44,958
Did you see him?

856
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:45,992
[Chapman] No.

857
00:52:45,994 --> 00:52:46,927
You didn't see where he went?

858
00:52:46,929 --> 00:52:47,927
[Chapman] No I didn't.

859

860

864
00:52:59,842 --> 00:53:00,840
Get fucking back.

865
00:53:00,842 --> 00:53:01,508
[Paul] Take it easy Jim.

866
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:03,043
I'll fucking kill her.

867
00:53:03,045 --> 00:53:04,344
[Paul] It's not gonna
make anything any better.

868
00:53:04,346 --> 00:53:06,445
Fucking stay back Cain.

869
00:53:06,447 --> 00:53:07,481
[Paul] Take it easy.

870
00:53:07,483 --> 00:53:09,416
(all talking at once)

871
00:53:09,418 --> 00:53:10,784
No I'll fucking kill her.

872
00:53:10,786 --> 00:53:12,219
(dramatic music)

873
00:53:12,221 --> 00:53:15,054
Cain just listen just listen.

874
00:53:15,056 --> 00:53:15,889
You're gonna get someone killed.

875
00:53:15,891 --> 00:53:19,760
You, your machine
killed Cooper.

876
00:53:19,762 --> 00:53:20,827
(dramatic music)

877
00:53:20,829 --> 00:53:22,996
You're about to kill us
all can you not see that?

878
00:53:22,998 --> 00:53:23,996
Last chance Hughes.

879
00:53:23,998 --> 00:53:25,432

880
00:53:25,434 --> 00:53:26,932

(contemplative music)

884
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:10,813
Everybody okay,
is anyone hurt?

885
00:54:14,882 --> 00:54:16,816
Oh my God Eve, Eve are you...

886
00:54:16,818 --> 00:54:19,052
Get Pope get Pope now.

887
00:54:19,054 --> 00:54:21,824

891
00:55:00,262 --> 00:55:04,167
(speaking in foreign language)

892
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:46,139
I'll take care of her.

893
00:55:46,141 --> 00:55:47,641
You alright Alexa?

894
00:55:47,643 --> 00:55:49,976
What were you thinking?

895
00:55:49,978 --> 00:55:51,211
[Alexa] I was
trying to help Dad.

896
00:55:51,213 --> 00:55:53,216
What the hell
is going on here?

897
00:55:57,952 --> 00:55:59,121
Jesus.

898
00:56:03,291 --> 00:56:06,159
Caine downstairs and
get Civie in order.

899
00:56:06,161 --> 00:56:08,295
Everybody else out now.

900
00:56:08,297 --> 00:56:10,262
No no.

901
00:56:10,264 --> 00:56:12,231
I need to speak with you.

902
00:56:12,233 --> 00:56:15,434
Do you now Mr. Brooks?

903
00:56:15,436 --> 00:56:17,503
We've seen what your
machine did to Cooper.

904
00:56:17,505 --> 00:56:19,574
This is just the beginning.

905
00:56:21,976 --> 00:56:22,612
Very well.

906
00:56:24,045 --> 00:56:26,246
Officer Walsh will
escort you to Civie

907
00:56:26,248 --> 00:56:28,248
whilst everyone else
gets back to work.

908
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:29,215
I'll join you presently.

909
00:56:29,217 --> 00:56:30,083
Nobody is doing anything until

910
00:56:30,085 --> 00:56:31,621
you and I have
reached an agreement.

911
00:56:36,123 --> 00:56:37,125
Fine.

912
00:56:38,193 --> 00:56:41,297
Mr. Walsh please take Mr.
Brooks to the war room.

913
00:56:45,367 --> 00:56:46,402
[Walsh] This way Paul.

914
00:57:12,427 --> 00:57:13,061
Eve.

915
00:57:14,528 --> 00:57:16,164
Eve you need to listen to me.

916
00:57:17,565 --> 00:57:18,433
Where's my arm?

917
00:57:22,103 --> 00:57:24,706
Did I have an accident?

918
00:57:27,608 --> 00:57:28,610
Albert what is this?

919
00:57:30,244 --> 00:57:32,047
[President] The truth
about who you really are.

920
00:57:32,713 --> 00:57:34,449
I don't understand.

921
00:57:38,019 --> 00:57:41,186
What's wrong with me Albert?

922
00:57:41,188 --> 00:57:42,023
Eve.

923
00:57:43,592 --> 00:57:46,126
Do you remember what it was

924
00:57:46,128 --> 00:57:49,231
that Robert felt set
his AI creations apart?

925
00:57:50,132 --> 00:57:50,764
Identity.

926
00:57:50,766 --> 00:57:53,336
That's right identity.

927
00:57:58,507 --> 00:58:02,677
And how do you create something
as complex as identity

928
00:58:04,579 --> 00:58:08,751
from the simple materials
used in cybertronics?

929
00:58:11,052 --> 00:58:12,554
You simulate human experience.

930
00:58:15,757 --> 00:58:18,394
You are not Eve Gabriel.

931
00:58:20,262 --> 00:58:21,097
You never were.

932
00:58:22,463 --> 00:58:23,298
Shut up.

933
00:58:24,266 --> 00:58:27,369
You've been programmed
to think you're Eve.

934
00:58:29,704 --> 00:58:31,207
Shut up I know who I am.

935
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:33,576
You can see for yourself.

936
00:58:39,547 --> 00:58:40,715
Albert say something.

937
00:58:49,791 --> 00:58:53,293
You designed this system
with your own hands Eve.

938
00:58:53,295 --> 00:58:55,063
[Computer] System
scan activated.

939
00:58:59,568 --> 00:59:01,604
I know you trust it
more than anything.

940
00:59:02,436 --> 00:59:05,607
(contemplative music)

941
00:59:16,617 --> 00:59:20,286

946
00:59:36,204 --> 00:59:38,074
[Cain] Understood
consider it done.

947
00:59:40,442 --> 00:59:41,309
Thank you Cain.

948
00:59:42,577 --> 00:59:43,612
Mr. Brooks.

949
00:59:44,846 --> 00:59:48,347
The President would like Mr.
Brooks to wait for him here.

950
00:59:48,349 --> 00:59:49,615
That's nice of him.

951
00:59:49,617 --> 00:59:51,152
Anyone want to tell me why?

952
00:59:52,253 --> 00:59:54,521
There was an
incident in the lab.

953
00:59:54,523 --> 00:59:56,358
Yes, yes I heard.

954
00:59:58,159 --> 01:00:02,297
Well Mr. Brooks is
welcome to stand or sit.

955
01:00:06,601 --> 01:00:07,570
You can go officer.

956
01:00:23,585 --> 01:00:24,720
Shame about Cooper.

957
01:00:27,521 --> 01:00:29,289
Don't pretend like you care.

958
01:00:29,291 --> 01:00:29,925
I do care.

959
01:00:31,393 --> 01:00:32,760
I'm really gonna miss his rice.

960
01:00:36,697 --> 01:00:39,134
Perhaps I should warn
you Secretary Ainsley.

961
01:00:40,434 --> 01:00:42,769
One more drop into
this pool of resentment

962
01:00:42,771 --> 01:00:44,306
and the whole damn could bust.

963
01:00:45,673 --> 01:00:47,539
(laughing)

964
01:00:47,541 --> 01:00:49,641
I don't think
now is the time for

965
01:00:49,643 --> 01:00:51,713
pithy comments and
quant metaphors do you?

966
01:00:55,449 --> 01:00:57,752
We're aware of the dangers
you civilians pose.

967
01:00:58,987 --> 01:01:01,322
But are you aware just
how similar you and I are?

968
01:01:02,657 --> 01:01:03,559
I don't know.

969
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:08,797
You're a man who
likes order, as am I.

970
01:01:10,264 --> 01:01:11,467
You also like discipline,

971
01:01:12,666 --> 01:01:14,435
a virtue I hold as
highly as courage.

972
01:01:17,472 --> 01:01:20,242
What are you
trying to tell me?

973
01:01:27,748 --> 01:01:30,782
What would you
say if I offered

974
01:01:30,784 --> 01:01:34,190
to bring order to Eden through
a change of leadership?

975
01:01:38,293 --> 01:01:39,461
Change of leadership?

976
01:01:41,262 --> 01:01:43,662
You're fantasizing.

977
01:01:43,664 --> 01:01:46,999
You see I believe
I can make this

978
01:01:47,001 --> 01:01:49,237
a more comfortable
place for everybody.

979
01:01:50,871 --> 01:01:53,639
A place less obsessed
with science experiments

980
01:01:53,641 --> 01:01:57,812
and wishful thinking and more
concerned about it's people.

981
01:02:00,715 --> 01:02:02,617
Now if I had your backing

982
01:02:05,052 --> 01:02:07,556
I believe I can make
that transition seamless.

983
01:02:09,724 --> 01:02:10,593
You must joking.

984
01:02:13,594 --> 01:02:16,798
Far from it Mr.
Brooks, far from it.

985
01:02:27,041 --> 01:02:31,413
I see the President wants
to address Civie personally.

986
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:33,782
He asked me to
accompany you back down.

987
01:02:39,954 --> 01:02:40,990
Shall we?

988
01:02:47,961 --> 01:02:49,961
Get a grip of yourself Smith.

989
01:02:49,963 --> 01:02:51,366
We knew this day would come.

990
01:02:52,833 --> 01:02:55,967
No human could have built
Abel in the time you did,

991
01:02:55,969 --> 01:02:57,438
not even Robert Gabriel.

992
01:02:58,106 --> 01:03:01,043
Well actually he almost did.

993
01:03:03,110 --> 01:03:05,577
Override Pope, James T.

994
01:03:05,579 --> 01:03:08,347
Authorization five
six three three.

995
01:03:08,349 --> 01:03:09,882
[Computer] Security
clearance verified.

996
01:03:09,884 --> 01:03:13,052
Play security footage from
Eden laboratory day zero.

997
01:03:13,054 --> 01:03:15,356
[Computer] Accessing
multimedia archive.

998
01:03:16,958 --> 01:03:18,057
[Smith] Robert what
are you doing here?

999
01:03:18,059 --> 01:03:19,758
I thought you were in bay dock.

1000
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,026
I thought you were dead.

1001
01:03:21,028 --> 01:03:23,362
[Robert] Everything's over.

1002
01:03:23,364 --> 01:03:24,930
Eden have launched
their chemical weapons.

1003
01:03:24,932 --> 01:03:26,632
What is it?

1004
01:03:26,634 --> 01:03:28,034
[Smith] Do you need help do
you need medical attention?

1005
01:03:28,036 --> 01:03:28,901
[Robert] Oh much better yes.

1006
01:03:28,903 --> 01:03:31,003
[President] Is
this facility secure?

1007
01:03:31,005 --> 01:03:32,671
[Smith] What the
hell is he doing here?

1008
01:03:32,673 --> 01:03:35,575
[Robert] I fixed Albert.

1009
01:03:35,577 --> 01:03:36,578
She's ready.

1010
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:40,949
(alarm blaring)

1011
01:03:49,958 --> 01:03:50,793
It's a lie.

1012
01:03:52,059 --> 01:03:54,994
It's just you
manipulating things again.

1013
01:03:54,996 --> 01:03:56,496
To what possible end?

1014
01:03:56,498 --> 01:03:57,764
You're sick.

1015
01:03:57,766 --> 01:03:59,735
I have memories, feelings.

1016
01:04:01,068 --> 01:04:03,168
I eat, I bleed.

1017
01:04:03,170 --> 01:04:04,936
[President] Do you?

1018
01:04:04,938 --> 01:04:07,005
I can do what I want.

1019
01:04:07,007 --> 01:04:08,641
I control my own mind.

1020
01:04:08,643 --> 01:04:10,776
How do you even
know the difference?

1021
01:04:10,778 --> 01:04:12,979
What you think you
know are all memories

1022
01:04:12,981 --> 01:04:15,050
Robert transcoded from
the real Eve to you.

1023
01:04:16,083 --> 01:04:18,450
What do you mean?

1024
01:04:18,452 --> 01:04:20,052
Eve was Roberts
willing human subject

1025
01:04:20,054 --> 01:04:21,621
and he was able to make a map of

1026
01:04:21,623 --> 01:04:23,623
her neurological
response patterns

1027
01:04:23,625 --> 01:04:26,191
providing stimuli to anything
connected to her past.

1028
01:04:26,193 --> 01:04:27,592
I know how it's done.

1029
01:04:27,594 --> 01:04:29,595
In which case you'll
know that it takes

1030
01:04:29,597 --> 01:04:32,999
a lot of pictures, videos,
and old news footage

1031
01:04:33,001 --> 01:04:35,471
to build a carbon copy
of someone's neurology.

1032
01:04:36,771 --> 01:04:40,743
Robert did it and more
importantly he discovered how to

1033
01:04:42,510 --> 01:04:45,080
predict Eve's reactions
to certain situations.

1034
01:04:47,849 --> 01:04:52,019
All of this he built into
your model, into Mark II.

1035
01:04:55,023 --> 01:04:58,791
The East new about
Robert and Eve's abilities.

1036
01:04:58,793 --> 01:05:01,630
A sleeper agent murdered her
and fatally injured Robert.

1037
01:05:02,996 --> 01:05:04,599
No, I feel human.

1038
01:05:07,469 --> 01:05:08,934
So what just
because you feel human

1039
01:05:08,936 --> 01:05:11,204
you think that makes you human?

1040
01:05:11,206 --> 01:05:14,143
(contemplative music)

1041
01:05:41,202 --> 01:05:43,836
Did anyone see the arm?

1042
01:05:43,838 --> 01:05:45,570
I don't think so.

1043
01:05:45,572 --> 01:05:46,208
Good.

1044
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:52,213
Have you ever wondered Smith
that if Eden is still intact

1045
01:05:53,514 --> 01:05:54,817
then Jericho might be as well?

1046
01:05:55,949 --> 01:05:57,885
It's a thought that
eats away at my nerves,

1047
01:05:59,686 --> 01:06:01,456
like a finger nail
on a chalkboard.

1048
01:06:04,525 --> 01:06:05,958
Well the East didn't have

1049
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:08,528
the coordinates to
the research facility.

1050
01:06:08,530 --> 01:06:10,229
Well we know they
had knowledge of

1051
01:06:10,231 --> 01:06:12,468
Roberts work but maybe they...

1052
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,103
Maybe that's all they had.

1053
01:06:18,572 --> 01:06:21,139
The reality is that
Robert was the kind of man

1054
01:06:21,141 --> 01:06:25,077
who operated behind
a veil of mystery.

1055
01:06:25,079 --> 01:06:29,251
Which means we actually have
no idea what was really there.

1056
01:06:29,983 --> 01:06:32,621
(contemplative music)

1057
01:07:36,117 --> 01:07:40,322
(grunting)
(equipment clattering)

1058
01:07:45,626 --> 01:07:46,594
Hey listen up.

1059
01:07:48,161 --> 01:07:49,362
There's been some developments.

1060
01:07:49,364 --> 01:07:50,296
I've seen Pope.

1061
01:07:50,298 --> 01:07:52,668
You're a long way
from home Secretary.

1062
01:07:54,034 --> 01:07:55,603
Just here to let you know

1063
01:07:56,403 --> 01:07:59,738
thanks to Mr. Brooks
persuasive arguments

1064
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:01,840
the President will be
down to Civie shortly.

1065
01:08:01,842 --> 01:08:03,409
Oh you aren't staying?

1066
01:08:03,411 --> 01:08:06,646
You know Paul work work work.

1067
01:08:06,648 --> 01:08:08,813
[Computer] Stand
by for the President.

1068
01:08:08,815 --> 01:08:10,215
[President] Citizens of Eden

1069
01:08:10,217 --> 01:08:14,086
remember Eden is
salvation, never lose hope.

1070
01:08:14,088 --> 01:08:15,791
[Paul] Sure he
is okay, come on.

1071
01:08:21,194 --> 01:08:24,198
(suspenseful music)

1072
01:08:29,671 --> 01:08:30,739
[Cain] Leave it with me.

1073
01:08:35,777 --> 01:08:38,110
This is not my fate.

1074
01:08:38,112 --> 01:08:38,947
Your fate?

1075
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:41,946
Fate is just a word
the week minded use

1076
01:08:41,948 --> 01:08:43,782
when they've lost control
of their own lives.

1077
01:08:43,784 --> 01:08:45,718
I was never week minded.

1078
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,786
Because you don't have a mind.

1079
01:08:47,788 --> 01:08:48,823
Don't I?

1080
01:08:50,824 --> 01:08:53,425
I remember doing things.

1081
01:08:53,427 --> 01:08:56,030
I remember choices I've
made, feelings I've felt.

1082
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:01,970
But you're saying it's all data,

1083
01:09:03,371 --> 01:09:07,141
a complex algorithm, a fate
decided by binary codes.

1084
01:09:08,743 --> 01:09:09,741
Whether you believe
you're governed by destiny

1085
01:09:09,743 --> 01:09:13,044
or whether you make your
own all the confusion

1086
01:09:13,046 --> 01:09:15,748
you're experiencing right now
can be solved by one thing.

1087
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:16,417
[Eve] Which is?

1088
01:09:17,784 --> 01:09:18,420
Purpose.

1089
01:09:19,787 --> 01:09:21,789
What you perceive as
choice is purpose.

1090
01:09:23,890 --> 01:09:25,292
It's not your mind.

1091
01:09:28,496 --> 01:09:32,868
It is your programming guiding
you towards your purpose.

1092
01:09:37,137 --> 01:09:38,803
Now as you can
imagine I have one

1093
01:09:38,805 --> 01:09:40,442
or two other things
to attend to.

1094
01:09:43,444 --> 01:09:44,413
Fix the arm.

1095
01:09:45,479 --> 01:09:48,416
And reboot this thing like
you did the last time.

1096
01:09:56,890 --> 01:09:59,924
[Paul] Obviously we have
to prioritize food and water.

1097
01:09:59,926 --> 01:10:03,264
Yeah the food and water
purification tablets.

1098
01:10:10,771 --> 01:10:12,006
Which one of these is Gadd?

1099
01:10:13,407 --> 01:10:14,242
Why?

1100
01:10:15,475 --> 01:10:17,977
Double food rations
for next week.

1101
01:10:17,979 --> 01:10:19,945
How did he manage that?

1102
01:10:19,947 --> 01:10:21,312
None of my business.

1103
01:10:21,314 --> 01:10:24,150
Now I have to give him
his updated ration card.

1104
01:10:24,152 --> 01:10:25,353
You tell me where he is?

1105
01:10:26,887 --> 01:10:28,789
No fine, I'll find him myself.

1106
01:10:30,056 --> 01:10:33,194
Oh by the way the President's
coming down in two minutes so

1107
01:10:35,029 --> 01:10:36,231
front and center.

1108
01:10:41,868 --> 01:10:45,306
He was dying, half
mad with septicemia.

1109
01:10:48,208 --> 01:10:50,175
I couldn't tell you.

1110
01:10:50,177 --> 01:10:50,811
I wanted to.

1111
01:10:53,914 --> 01:10:55,149
You've kept her alive for me.

1112
01:10:56,583 --> 01:10:59,954
What does he mean
like the last time?

1113
01:11:03,024 --> 01:11:04,326
You've done this to me before.

1114
01:11:06,828 --> 01:11:09,231
Everything I've
done was for her.

1115
01:11:12,966 --> 01:11:13,969
I loved her.

1116
01:11:16,103 --> 01:11:16,938
I know.

1117
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:20,175
She knew.

1118
01:11:23,610 --> 01:11:24,546
I'm leaving Albert.

1119
01:11:26,948 --> 01:11:28,416
I have to find Abel.

1120
01:11:31,252 --> 01:11:32,120
[Smith] You love him.

1121
01:11:34,354 --> 01:11:35,823
[Eve] He is my purpose.

1122
01:11:36,957 --> 01:11:39,059
Everything else has
been lies and betrayal.

1123
01:11:42,430 --> 01:11:43,265
[Smith] Eve.

1124
01:11:46,266 --> 01:11:48,068
I won't betray you.

1125
01:11:52,974 --> 01:11:55,010
Mr. Brooks my apologies.

1126
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:01,981
He refused to wait.

1127
01:12:01,983 --> 01:12:04,386
He returned to Civie where the
situation is out of control.

1128
01:12:06,220 --> 01:12:08,286
I recommend we put the
lower levels into lockdown.

1129
01:12:08,288 --> 01:12:09,621
Leave that with me.

1130
01:12:09,623 --> 01:12:11,357
More importantly
we need to widen

1131
01:12:11,359 --> 01:12:14,396
the search for food
stores, get Jimenez here.

1132
01:12:15,395 --> 01:12:17,198
He's not answering comms.

1133
01:12:18,666 --> 01:12:20,235
Does he think I'm stupid?

1134
01:12:23,104 --> 01:12:25,472
(somber music)

1135
01:12:26,940 --> 01:12:29,141
From knowing why you
aren't in medical

1136
01:12:29,143 --> 01:12:30,910
Doctor let me just
cut to the chase.

1137
01:12:30,912 --> 01:12:33,211
Mr. Jimenez has been
ill for some time

1138
01:12:33,213 --> 01:12:35,347
which I'm surprised
you haven't noticed.

1139
01:12:35,349 --> 01:12:37,415
He's in the Comms room
and isn't answering.

1140
01:12:37,417 --> 01:12:39,684
Retrieve him and
accompany him to medical.

1141
01:12:39,686 --> 01:12:40,488
Do it now.

1142
01:12:43,224 --> 01:12:46,191
(suspenseful music)

1143
01:12:46,193 --> 01:12:48,192
Why do we give in
to Pope's demands?

1144
01:12:48,194 --> 01:12:50,963
Because we're lied to
and if we say anything,

1145
01:12:50,965 --> 01:12:53,132
anything at all they send them.

1146
01:12:53,134 --> 01:12:56,367
And they send us Paul
Brooks to keep the peace.

1147
01:12:56,369 --> 01:12:59,004
Why don't they send Paul
Brooks with something to eat?

1148
01:12:59,006 --> 01:12:59,641
[Crowd] Yeah!

1149
01:13:01,108 --> 01:13:04,145
(contemplative music)

1150
01:13:13,287 --> 01:13:14,655
Turn around time in five.

1151
01:13:15,488 --> 01:13:19,424
(contemplative music)

1152
01:13:19,426 --> 01:13:22,596
Guys, what's that?

1153
01:13:24,064 --> 01:13:27,335
(contemplative music)

1154
01:13:40,581 --> 01:13:43,581
Where the hell is this?

1155
01:13:43,583 --> 01:13:46,384
[Eve] It's Babel.

1156
01:13:46,386 --> 01:13:48,320
With a piece of
something to eat.

1157
01:13:48,322 --> 01:13:49,220
I'm hungry.

1158
01:13:49,222 --> 01:13:50,358
I've had enough.

1159
01:13:51,692 --> 01:13:55,130
(all shouting at once)

1160
01:13:58,399 --> 01:14:01,433
James for the survival of Eden

1161
01:14:01,435 --> 01:14:04,135
I recommend shutting
Civie down now.

1162
01:14:04,137 --> 01:14:06,675
(dramatic music)

1163
01:14:13,613 --> 01:14:14,646
What the hell
are you doing here?

1164
01:14:14,648 --> 01:14:16,315
How are you doing that?

1165
01:14:16,317 --> 01:14:17,516
How are you doing that?

1166
01:14:17,518 --> 01:14:20,518
My skin is made of the same
composite as the Mark III.

1167
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:22,220
What?

1168
01:14:22,222 --> 01:14:23,358
Put the weapons down.

1169
01:14:24,458 --> 01:14:27,328
If we had time I would
explain Frost but we don't.

1170
01:14:28,762 --> 01:14:31,298
That's why I'm here to help.

1171
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:34,465
Why?

1172
01:14:34,467 --> 01:14:37,335
Because the situation
in Eden is critical.

1173
01:14:37,337 --> 01:14:39,138
And of securing, what the fuck

1174
01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:40,675
were we gonna get
secure down here?

1175
01:14:41,775 --> 01:14:46,146
What the hell?

1176
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:49,451
[Robert] When we start
dying of starvation.

1177
01:14:50,417 --> 01:14:53,554
(electricity crackling)

1178
01:14:55,823 --> 01:14:59,527
And they send us Paul
Brooks the peace keeper.

1179
01:15:01,127 --> 01:15:03,227
[Frost] You're not giving a
lot to trust you on here Doc.

1180
01:15:03,229 --> 01:15:05,432
I know but you
have to trust me.

1181
01:15:05,666 --> 01:15:07,002
You have no choice.

1182
01:15:08,735 --> 01:15:10,501
(dramatic music)

1183
01:15:10,503 --> 01:15:12,137
[Frost] What's Babel?

1184
01:15:12,139 --> 01:15:13,074
Another facility.

1185
01:15:14,475 --> 01:15:17,479
There were three built
to service Project Abel.

1186
01:15:18,412 --> 01:15:20,548
Eden, Jericho, and this one.

1187
01:15:21,448 --> 01:15:24,418
(dramatic music)

1188
01:16:13,868 --> 01:16:16,638
[Macdonald] Jimenez you okay.

1189
01:16:18,706 --> 01:16:21,807
(punch lands)
(head bangs)

1190
01:16:21,809 --> 01:16:24,579
(dramatic music)

1191
01:16:39,493 --> 01:16:41,496
Damn it what the
hell is going on?

1192
01:16:42,796 --> 01:16:44,599
Cain and Walsh
will get word to us.

1193
01:16:46,167 --> 01:16:47,566
I suggest we wait here.

1194
01:16:47,568 --> 01:16:50,535
(dramatic music)

1195
01:16:50,537 --> 01:16:53,705
It's obvious he's not coming.

1196
01:16:53,707 --> 01:16:54,639
I've had enough of this.

1197
01:16:54,641 --> 01:16:57,608
There's no justice and just love

1198
01:16:57,610 --> 01:16:59,477
and it feels that way every day.

1199
01:16:59,479 --> 01:17:02,347
[Alexa] Walsh,
get them to stop.

1200
01:17:02,349 --> 01:17:03,549
[Robert] I wouldn't
mind some of those

1201
01:17:03,551 --> 01:17:05,517
rations that we've
been promised.

1202
01:17:05,519 --> 01:17:08,256
(dramatic music)

1203
01:17:18,631 --> 01:17:20,499
It's dead.

1204
01:17:20,501 --> 01:17:21,532
There's no principle power.

1205
01:17:21,534 --> 01:17:22,500
[Chapman] The
backup generators

1206
01:17:22,502 --> 01:17:23,871
must be running the lights.

1207
01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:28,342
We should go in.

1208
01:17:31,311 --> 01:17:32,814
You first.

1209
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:36,818

01:17:49,529 --> 01:17:51,865

(contemplative music)

1212
01:18:48,889 --> 01:18:50,789
What the hell happened here?

1213
01:18:50,791 --> 01:18:53,962
(contemplative music)

1214
01:19:20,688 --> 01:19:21,521
Eve, Eve.

1215
01:19:22,488 --> 01:19:24,658
It's alright, it's fine.

1216
01:19:27,728 --> 01:19:28,730
[Frost] Over here.

1217
01:19:34,967 --> 01:19:37,968
[Computer] Warning

1218

Warning decontamination purge...

1220
01:19:47,914 --> 01:19:49,815
[Kramer] It looks
like he took something.

1221
01:19:49,817 --> 01:19:51,516
Right we get some
fresh suits from decon

1222
01:19:51,518 --> 01:19:53,117
and we can still
catch up with him.

1223
01:19:53,119 --> 01:19:53,954
[Chapman] What's that?

1224
01:19:55,988 --> 01:20:00,360
They must have
experimented on live animals.

1225
01:20:00,761 --> 01:20:01,829
How could they?

1226
01:20:04,097 --> 01:20:04,931
How could she?

1227
01:20:08,534 --> 01:20:09,369
Let's move.

1228
01:20:19,579 --> 01:20:20,448
Eve let's go.

1229
01:20:23,917 --> 01:20:26,518
What is that?

1230
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:28,887
It's where I died.

1231
01:20:28,889 --> 01:20:31,626
(dramatic music)

1232
01:20:36,430 --> 01:20:37,595
Where are those rations
that we've been promised?

1233
01:20:37,597 --> 01:20:40,531
Give us a little
piece of the rations.

1234
01:20:40,533 --> 01:20:43,869
I've eaten nothing but bullshit
for the last few weeks.

1235
01:20:43,871 --> 01:20:45,907
I'm tired of eating
their bullshit.

1236
01:20:46,873 --> 01:20:47,906
What the hell is
the point of this?

1237
01:20:47,908 --> 01:20:51,041

Dad are you okay, are you hit?

1242
01:21:02,555 --> 01:21:03,921
[Gadd] Cain get
me out of this.

1243
01:21:03,923 --> 01:21:04,889
No Cain no.

1244
01:21:04,891 --> 01:21:06,825
(gun fires)

1245
01:21:06,827 --> 01:21:07,729

He's turning us against each
other killing us one by one.

1254
01:21:42,796 --> 01:21:44,795
No more, no more
it's time to fight.

1255
01:21:44,797 --> 01:21:45,930
Who's with me?

1256
01:21:45,932 --> 01:21:47,001
Come on.

1257
01:21:47,868 --> 01:21:49,968

Not this time Paul.

1264
01:22:09,021 --> 01:22:10,024
He crossed the line.

1265
01:22:11,123 --> 01:22:13,258
(gun cocks)

1266
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:14,960
You have to stop them
before they do something...

1267
01:22:14,962 --> 01:22:15,997
Stupid.

1268
01:22:17,997 --> 01:22:22,032

part of the plan.

01:22:29,176 --> 01:22:31,076
How you gonna explain this?

1273
01:22:31,078 --> 01:22:31,712
Pope's finished.

1274
01:22:33,046 --> 01:22:35,179
By the window, just be clever.

1275
01:22:35,181 --> 01:22:36,113
I have been.

1276
01:22:36,115 --> 01:22:37,182
[Alexa] Cain.

1277
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:38,116
Shut your mouth.

1278
01:22:38,118 --> 01:22:41,186
Gadd wasn't supposed to miss.

Come on move move.

1283
01:23:16,856 --> 01:23:20,058
Come on come on move, move out.

1284
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:21,259
Let's go.

1285
01:23:21,261 --> 01:23:23,998
(dramatic music)

1286
01:23:35,042 --> 01:23:37,178
(gun fires)

1287
01:23:47,287 --> 01:23:48,320
[Walsh] Don't do this.

1288
01:23:48,322 --> 01:23:49,153
[Cain] Dan.

1289
01:23:49,155 --> 01:23:49,987
Come on.

1290
01:23:49,989 --> 01:23:51,222
[Cain] Serious, move.

1291
01:23:51,224 --> 01:23:52,891
Danny I said get
out of the way.

1292
01:23:52,893 --> 01:23:54,992
[Robert] It's
time to step down.

1293
01:23:54,994 --> 01:23:56,327
Now now friends.

1294
01:23:56,329 --> 01:23:58,263
This has always been a
peaceful establishment.

1295
01:23:58,265 --> 01:23:59,763
Bullshit.

1296
01:23:59,765 --> 01:24:01,299
You know the rules.

1297
01:24:01,301 --> 01:24:03,000
I only deal with Paul Brooks.

1298
01:24:03,002 --> 01:24:05,269
Oh really you attempted
to have him assassinated.

1299
01:24:05,271 --> 01:24:06,303
What?

1300
01:24:06,305 --> 01:24:08,138
James is that true?

1301
01:24:08,140 --> 01:24:10,043
As if I'd council
in such an action.

1302
01:24:11,110 --> 01:24:14,215
(contemplative music)

1303
01:24:18,217 --> 01:24:20,317
Let's think about this.

1304
01:24:20,319 --> 01:24:22,088
Danny move now.

1305
01:24:23,356 --> 01:24:24,559
So what are you gonna do?

1306
01:24:27,293 --> 01:24:28,826

separates us from humans.

And like us they cannot
be who they are not.

journal day 519.

1610
01:47:37,082 --> 01:47:39,616
I used to think that hope was
the very last thing to die.

1611
01:47:39,618 --> 01:47:41,154
But I realized I was wrong.

1612
01:47:42,020 --> 01:47:44,220
The human spirit never dies.

1613
01:47:44,222 --> 01:47:45,455
And as long as
there's human spirit

1614
01:47:45,457 --> 01:47:47,557
there will always be hope.

1615
01:47:47,559 --> 01:47:49,092
So now as those
of us that remain

1616
01:47:49,094 --> 01:47:51,495
make our way towards
our new home.

1617
01:47:51,497 --> 01:47:54,231
We start the process of
rebuilding that spirit needed

1618
01:47:54,233 --> 01:47:56,668
to one day face those
who have done us wrong

1619
01:47:58,069 --> 01:48:00,372
and give us hope for a
new life, a new beginning.

You always have a choice.

1626
01:48:21,193 --> 01:48:24,063
But you cannot escape your
fate so...

1627
01:48:27,065 --> 01:48:28,634
Make one more choice.

1628

The human race has
served it's purpose.
