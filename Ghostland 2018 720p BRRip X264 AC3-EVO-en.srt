Here we go.

26
00:02:31,448 --> 00:02:32,917
It is one of your best.

27
00:02:33,008 --> 00:02:35,475
- Mom, you always say it.
- Yes

28
00:02:35,506 --> 00:02:36,953
But this time I'm serious.

29
00:02:37,202 --> 00:02:37,820
Really?

30
00:02:37,842 --> 00:02:40,017
I was fascinated, captivated ...

31
00:02:40,051 --> 00:02:41,053
scared.

32
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:42,318
It looked like...

33
00:02:42,376 --> 00:02:43,512
Lovecraft.

34
00:02:43,775 --> 00:02:45,848
- Already. It seems too much, right?
- Do not.

35
00:02:45,882 --> 00:02:47,642
I did not find totally
my own voice yet.

36
00:02:48,573 --> 00:02:50,229
Yes. That's it!

37
00:02:50,294 --> 00:02:52,399
- Vera!
- Mom, my sister is a phenomenon.

38
00:02:52,607 --> 00:02:54,499
- Tell me something new, please.
- Do not!

39
00:02:54,535 --> 00:02:55,325
Beth, honestly,

40
00:02:55,357 --> 00:02:58,292
I do not understand how you can spend days,

41
00:02:58,326 --> 00:03:00,855
writing that shit that
ends with urine on the carpet.

42
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:02,121
You do not understand.

43
00:03:02,551 --> 00:03:04,423
What the hell you want
Say with your stories?

44
00:03:04,457 --> 00:03:06,619
- They're supposed to be terrifying.
- Terrifying.

45
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:09,214
Terrifying is having you as a sister,
good luck to find a boyfriend.

46

<i> Calma, Vera. </ i>

Keep writing, Beth.

49
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,431
And if I'm not what
good enough?

50
00:03:17,455 --> 00:03:19,175
You're good enough, Beth.

51
00:03:20,147 --> 00:03:22,019
You only say that for
What are you, my mom?

52
00:03:26,036 --> 00:03:27,116
What is that?

53
00:03:36,929 --> 00:03:38,120
But what the fuck?

54
00:03:56,563 --> 00:03:58,265
Okay friend.

55

<i> Come on, Vera, have manners. </ i>

56
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,145
No French, mom!

57
00:04:30,046 --> 00:04:31,046
Do not.

58
00:04:33,468 --> 00:04:35,466
<i> Yes, it's fine. Yes. </ I>

59

00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,704
My mom and I love old things.

61
00:04:41,967 --> 00:04:44,012
- Are they just passing through?
- Do not.

62
00:04:44,194 --> 00:04:45,440
We are moving here.

63
00:04:45,466 --> 00:04:46,668
For Aunt Clarice's house.

64
00:04:46,692 --> 00:04:48,546
Aunt Clarice? Does she live around here?

65
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,859
I'm not sure exactly.

66
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:51,508
I mean, he died.

67
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:54,276
She was the sister-in-law of the
My mom's cousin or something like that.

68
00:04:54,579 --> 00:04:57,218
Clarice Giordan!
The French lady,

69
00:04:57,252 --> 00:04:59,365
who lives in that house ...
Dammit!

70
00:04:59,643 --> 00:05:02,623
For the love of God! It's going to smell
to enamel here for a week!

71
00:05:03,672 --> 00:05:06,318
Watch the store for me,
Miss Giordan.

72
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,794
My last name is Keller.

75
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:53,704
What are you doing?

76
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:56,907
What is that?

77
00:05:57,112 --> 00:05:58,440
A story that you would not like.

78
00:05:58,737 --> 00:05:59,737
As you know?

79
00:06:01,308 --> 00:06:02,566
There is nobody here?

80
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,646
My God, it stinks.

81
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:06,965
She is coming back.

82
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:13,491
Oh my God!
I look horrendous.

83
00:06:15,015 --> 00:06:16,515
Agree,
what is the story about?

84
00:06:17,108 --> 00:06:19,485
A guy is entering
the houses of the people.

85
00:06:19,585 --> 00:06:21,813
Killing parents
and saving the daughters.

86
00:06:22,184 --> 00:06:23,911
All about your age.

87
00:06:24,604 --> 00:06:25,604
Y...?

88
00:06:25,823 --> 00:06:27,370
He stays at home with them.

89
00:06:28,081 --> 00:06:29,994
Along with the corpses
parental.

90
00:06:30,581 --> 00:06:32,682
- You are inventing it.
- Girls!

91
00:06:35,026 --> 00:06:36,026
Let's move on!

92
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:51,109
Jesus Christ.

93
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:53,045
It's Rob Zombi's house.

<i> It's not so bad. </ i>

96
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,225
It is an extension of your brain.

97
00:07:01,815 --> 00:07:02,895
They have to be kidding.

98
00:07:02,935 --> 00:07:04,503
The rooms are upstairs.

99
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,148
Mom, it smells like old people here.

100
00:07:06,236 --> 00:07:07,952
It has a moldy smell, Vera.

101
00:07:08,084 --> 00:07:09,402
Yes, that's what I said.

102
00:07:11,844 --> 00:07:13,929
- Look at all those dolls.
- Yes

103
00:07:13,946 --> 00:07:16,216
Clarice never
I let them play with them.

104
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:18,213
What was the problem
of Aunt Clarice?

105
00:07:20,847 --> 00:07:21,931
Is working?

106
00:07:21,965 --> 00:07:23,228
Do not!

107
00:07:26,753 --> 00:07:27,892
<i> Now, yes! </ i>

108
00:07:31,465 --> 00:07:34,026
<i> When are you going to leave?
that fucking machine? </ i>

109
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,285
And only use a laptop!

110
00:07:35,585 --> 00:07:36,585
Never.

111
00:07:36,782 --> 00:07:39,166
God,
It's like the Flea Market here.

112
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:42,884
She bought everything
this for herself?

113
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:44,730
The old women love
this kind of shit.

114
00:07:45,538 --> 00:07:47,277
A Chinese puzzle box.

115
00:07:47,571 --> 00:07:48,571
What?

116
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,413
It is more than a mirror.

117
00:07:50,498 --> 00:07:52,398
It's really a box.
I read about this.

118
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,632
There must be a button
secret somewhere.

119
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:10,096
Jesus!

120
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,649
So, do you like it here?

121
00:08:15,683 --> 00:08:16,749
Do not!

122
00:08:32,797 --> 00:08:34,470
<i> Vera, be careful with that. </ i>

123
00:08:34,504 --> 00:08:36,439
<i> Who will buy something like that? </ i>

124
00:08:39,676 --> 00:08:40,676
Love?

125
00:08:42,668 --> 00:08:43,668
Baby?

126
00:08:44,988 --> 00:08:45,996
Beth?

127
00:08:47,242 --> 00:08:48,776
I'm fine.

128
00:08:50,766 --> 00:08:52,170
Oh honey.

129
00:08:53,106 --> 00:08:54,721
Of course it's fine.

130
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:56,744
That's why you looked so pale.

131
00:08:56,778 --> 00:08:57,778
What happened to her?

132
00:08:57,907 --> 00:08:58,907
Nothing.

133
00:08:59,798 --> 00:09:01,099
She is like you now.

134
00:09:02,854 --> 00:09:03,854
Great.

135
00:09:04,246 --> 00:09:05,778
You know that you choose the best moment.

136
00:09:05,787 --> 00:09:07,323
Vera!

137
00:09:19,644 --> 00:09:20,720
She is fine?

138
00:09:21,054 --> 00:09:22,207
Now you ask.

139
00:09:22,326 --> 00:09:24,200
You could have stayed and helped.

140
00:09:24,227 --> 00:09:25,342
Why bother?

141
00:09:25,343 --> 00:09:26,926
You ran to rescue her
anyway.

142
00:09:29,795 --> 00:09:31,400
I do not know why he writes
these stories...

143
00:09:31,423 --> 00:09:33,224
and it crumbles with
a little blood

144
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:34,259
Mom, she ...

145
00:09:34,435 --> 00:09:35,932
She is afraid of flying.

146
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:37,541
He is afraid of the boys.

147
00:09:37,565 --> 00:09:39,358
He is afraid of his own
damn shadow.

148
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:46,620
When I packed the other day,
I found something...

149
00:09:46,654 --> 00:09:47,781
what you would not believe

150
00:09:47,973 --> 00:09:49,746
I'm not in the mood, Vera.

151
00:09:51,535 --> 00:09:52,704
An interview.

152
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,108
With her, mom.

153
00:09:54,278 --> 00:09:57,270
Several written pages
as if it were in a magazine.

154
00:09:57,762 --> 00:09:59,590
She invented everything.

155
00:09:59,671 --> 00:10:01,818
At the interview,
she is a famous writer ...

156
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:04,408
and they are asking you
about his books.

157
00:10:04,732 --> 00:10:06,941
I should check your reality, mom.

158
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,563
It's good to know what you want to
your sister, after all.

159
00:10:11,288 --> 00:10:13,586
I know you're angry
for leaving your boyfriend.

160
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,902
Whatever, mom.

161
00:10:14,936 --> 00:10:16,521
And stop using makeup.

162
00:10:26,773 --> 00:10:28,133
Fuck you!

163
00:10:28,517 --> 00:10:30,073
Piece of shit.

164
00:10:30,856 --> 00:10:32,570
I know you love her more!

165
00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:37,827
Beth. Beth. Beth.

166
00:10:37,861 --> 00:10:39,040
Damn Beth.

167
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,746
Shit.

168
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,778
Shit!

169
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:02,504
Mom!

170
00:11:03,325 --> 00:11:05,377
Where is your antique lamp?

171
00:11:05,473 --> 00:11:06,997
<i> Down there. </ i>

172
00:11:07,723 --> 00:11:09,560
Who is your favorite writer?
Already.

173
00:11:09,594 --> 00:11:11,987
Your old lamp!
Where do I put it?

174
00:11:12,137 --> 00:11:13,193
<i> In the room. </ i>

175
00:11:16,917 --> 00:11:17,954
<i> Can you hear me? </ i>

176
00:11:18,754 --> 00:11:20,142
Yes!

177
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,055
Hears! Calm with the door.

178
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:33,522
Are you enjoying my bed?

179
00:11:35,871 --> 00:11:36,980
This is yours.

180
00:11:37,817 --> 00:11:39,069
And this is also yours.

181
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,264
Your shits are not going to
stay in my room.

182
00:11:41,298 --> 00:11:42,298
Take them.

183
00:11:44,528 --> 00:11:47,326
<i> Would it kill you to be more
kind to your sister? </ i>

184
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,712
<i> Maybe yes. </ i>

185
00:11:48,921 --> 00:11:50,504
<i> It was what I thought. </ i>

186
00:11:52,852 --> 00:11:54,109
It is not mine.

187
00:11:59,656 --> 00:12:00,854
It is an old house.

188
00:12:05,797 --> 00:12:07,460
<i> Mom! It's my room! </ I>

189
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,217
<i> Go help Lovecraft's daughter. </ i>

190
00:12:09,656 --> 00:12:10,656
<i> Jesus! </ i>

191
00:12:15,764 --> 00:12:16,840
Lower!

192
00:12:28,398 --> 00:12:29,482
Shit.

193
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,762
Jane? What?

194
00:12:38,355 --> 00:12:39,372
Hello?

195
00:12:41,953 --> 00:12:42,990
Hello?

196
00:12:43,539 --> 00:12:45,738
Jane? I can not hear you.

197
00:13:18,945 --> 00:13:19,945
<i> Mom? </ i>

198
00:13:20,886 --> 00:13:22,881
<i> Did you hear that? Mom ?! </ i>

199
00:13:34,656 --> 00:13:36,208
<i> No! </ i>

200
00:13:37,938 --> 00:13:40,282
<i> No. No! </ I>

201
00:13:42,165 --> 00:13:43,412
<i> Stop! </ i>

202
00:13:43,853 --> 00:13:44,853
<i> Fuck! </ i>

203
00:15:29,475 --> 00:15:30,968
Help!

204
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,214
Help...

205
00:15:56,901 --> 00:15:59,627
He just wants to play with the dolls.

206
00:16:09,486 --> 00:16:10,912
Do not look at me.

207
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,352
Do not!

208
00:17:28,538 --> 00:17:29,538
Mom.

209
00:17:34,628 --> 00:17:36,589
Listen to me, Beth.

210
00:17:37,118 --> 00:17:38,998
You have to go, please.

211
00:17:39,032 --> 00:17:40,905
Go away. Escape!

212
00:17:40,908 --> 00:17:42,171
Escape

213
00:17:43,673 --> 00:17:45,128
Do not!

214
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:08,624
Do not!

215
00:18:10,271 --> 00:18:11,379
Damned.

216
00:18:17,979 --> 00:18:19,414
Do not!

217
00:18:43,693 --> 00:18:44,789
Mom!

218
00:18:53,641 --> 00:18:54,641
Do not.

219
00:18:54,872 --> 00:18:56,988
Mom! Mom, no!

220
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,102
Mom...

221
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:01,667
Do not!

222
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,766
- Do not!
- Beth!

223
00:19:02,771 --> 00:19:03,771
Look here, Beth!

224
00:19:03,951 --> 00:19:05,215
Honey, honey, come here.

225
00:19:05,388 --> 00:19:07,240
Hey hey. It's okay, Beth.
It's okay.

226
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:08,887
You're good.

227
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:11,957
You're good.

228
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:12,989
Hears.

229
00:19:13,024 --> 00:19:14,395
Oh my God!

230
00:19:16,732 --> 00:19:18,658
- I was in the basement.
- I know.

231
00:19:19,069 --> 00:19:19,913
I know.

232
00:19:20,052 --> 00:19:21,078
With Vera.

233
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,573
It's over now. Agree?

234
00:19:23,146 --> 00:19:24,173
It was so real.

235
00:19:24,255 --> 00:19:25,823
It was a long time ago, Beth.

236
00:19:31,056 --> 00:19:32,103
Hears.

237
00:19:40,777 --> 00:19:43,099
<i> It's a beautiful morning at CO1. </ i>

238

00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,664

241
00:20:32,874 --> 00:20:33,874
Yes?

242
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:35,243
It's Jerry.

243
00:20:37,718 --> 00:20:38,619
Hey, Jerry.

244
00:20:38,741 --> 00:20:41,010
I'm not sorry,
she can not answer now.

245
00:20:41,045 --> 00:20:41,872
<i> We have to talk. </ i>

246
00:20:41,906 --> 00:20:43,016
I'm going to ask you to call soon.

<i> It's about sales. </ i>

248
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:44,889
Sorry?

249

<i> Five times more, my friend.
Are you writing? </ I>

250
00:20:47,702 --> 00:20:49,784
Yes, of course he is writing.
Yes.

251
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,860
I do not know, Jerry.

252
00:20:51,968 --> 00:20:53,475
I am going to tell you. It is right here.

253
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,024
I'm going to tell you right now,
agree?

254
00:20:55,048 --> 00:20:56,181
It's okay. Great. Thank you.

255
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:00,727
All the personnel of the
Editorial will be in the show.

256
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:03,043
Your sales skyrocketed.

257
00:21:03,077 --> 00:21:04,306
They adore you

258
00:21:04,755 --> 00:21:06,447
They love sales.

259
00:21:06,614 --> 00:21:07,783
You want to know?

260
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,549
I hate the numbers.

261
00:21:09,724 --> 00:21:10,752
Good...

262
00:21:10,863 --> 00:21:12,032
They are gigantic.

263
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,215
And they love you.

264
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,879
Yes, hello. Do not.

265
00:21:19,913 --> 00:21:21,275
I just told you

266
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,313
It's okay. I know...

267
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:25,584
<i> Today's guest was
called the teacher of horror. </ i>

268
00:21:25,863 --> 00:21:27,014
His latest book,

269
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:29,024
is "Incident in
Land of Ghosts ".

270
00:21:29,123 --> 00:21:30,687
It just came out two weeks ago,

271
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,632
and it's already on top of the
lists of the best sellers.

272
00:21:33,912 --> 00:21:35,666
We are very lucky
in having it here.

273
00:21:35,668 --> 00:21:38,762
And rarely makes appearances
on television.

274
00:21:38,874 --> 00:21:40,032
Elizabeth Keller

275
00:21:41,065 --> 00:21:43,322
It's a pleasure to meet you, Elizabeth.

276
00:21:43,534 --> 00:21:44,919
The pleasure is all mine, Eve.

277
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,995
"Incident in the Land of Ghosts" ...

278
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:49,662
It's your most book
personal until now.

279
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:52,069
And a kind of
tribute to your family.

280
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,590
If true.

281
00:21:54,061 --> 00:21:56,906
What happened to you and your sister
when were they teenagers?

282
00:21:58,263 --> 00:22:00,622
Are you asking if the
Book is an autobiography?

283
00:22:00,866 --> 00:22:02,170
What I mean, Elizabeth,

284
00:22:02,204 --> 00:22:03,932
it feels so real

285
00:22:04,117 --> 00:22:06,204
The details are so intense.

286
00:22:06,238 --> 00:22:08,713
I guess the question is,
"Why write this book?"

287
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:11,516
To avoid going crazy.

288
00:22:11,617 --> 00:22:12,617
Really?

289
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:15,441
<i> I mean, </ i>

290
00:22:15,712 --> 00:22:17,731
<i> is there any better reason to write? </ i>

291
00:22:17,976 --> 00:22:18,429
<i> No. </ i>

292
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:20,357
She did not stop
Talk about Vera and me.

293
00:22:20,828 --> 00:22:22,948
I got defensive.
Everyone must have noticed.

294
00:22:24,327 --> 00:22:25,923
It's not that bad.

295
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:29,251
When you are mysterious,
you are the one who commands

296
00:22:29,894 --> 00:22:32,154
You only say that for being
my greatest admirer

297
00:22:32,188 --> 00:22:33,215
Shit.

298
00:22:33,392 --> 00:22:34,417
You're right.

299
00:22:38,619 --> 00:22:40,525
I'm going to take the Harlequin to bed.

300
00:22:41,345 --> 00:22:43,429
are you sure you want?
see this again?

301
00:22:44,439 --> 00:22:46,965
Take it from him and go
how much does it matter?

302
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:50,799
He will not go to bed using this,
true?

303
00:22:50,826 --> 00:22:52,534
Why not?
He loves this disguise.

304
00:22:56,259 --> 00:22:57,656
I told you, they love you.

305
00:23:03,661 --> 00:23:04,661
Hello?

306
00:23:07,114 --> 00:23:08,114
Hello?

307
00:23:09,247 --> 00:23:10,479
<i> - Hello?

Vera?

317
00:23:29,981 --> 00:23:31,960
Your mom is obviously with her,
true?

318
00:23:31,996 --> 00:23:32,996
It has to be.

319
00:23:34,741 --> 00:23:36,062
Answer, answer

320
00:23:36,246 --> 00:23:37,292
Its busy.

321
00:23:38,565 --> 00:23:40,312
Okay, try again.

00:24:08,476 --> 00:24:09,476
<i> I'll do it. </ i>

335
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:10,985
<i> Be careful. </ i>

336
00:24:35,385 --> 00:24:36,693
Here? Are you sure?

337
00:24:37,197 --> 00:24:38,197
Yes.

338
00:24:56,455 --> 00:24:57,514
Mom?

339
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:04,369
Mom?

340
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:10,864
Mom?

341
00:25:12,743 --> 00:25:13,743
Beth?

342
00:25:15,308 --> 00:25:16,802
My girl!

343
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,266
What are you doing here?

344
00:25:20,337 --> 00:25:22,046
Why did not you say you would come?

345
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,155
Vera called me last night.

346
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:25,699
She was screaming and the
phone connection was cut.

347
00:25:25,743 --> 00:25:27,843
I tried calling back,
but I did not get it.

348
00:25:27,995 --> 00:25:29,414
And I did not know what was happening.

349
00:25:29,497 --> 00:25:31,235
I had no idea
who used the phone

350
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:31,948
Everything is alright?

351
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,781
Yes. She is resting.

352
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,190
I missed you so much.

353
00:25:39,023 --> 00:25:40,321
You are very pretty.

354
00:25:40,355 --> 00:25:42,098
You have not changed anything.

355
00:26:12,282 --> 00:26:14,169
The house follows exactly
same, mom.

356
00:26:14,641 --> 00:26:15,641
Good...

357
00:26:16,813 --> 00:26:19,422
After so many years,
You still have your crazy style.

358
00:26:20,149 --> 00:26:21,168
It's fair.

359
00:26:21,276 --> 00:26:22,822
I sold most of the things.

360
00:26:23,931 --> 00:26:24,931
Yes?

361
00:26:25,102 --> 00:26:27,927
You will not believe how much I won
for the old toys.

362
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:28,624
Really?

363
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:32,534
Y,
I will be able to rebuild the whole house.

364
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,715
Do not you receive the
Money that I send?

365
00:26:36,796 --> 00:26:37,796
Of course.

366
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:42,261
Oh, Beth.

367
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:45,067
I did not mean that.

368
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:46,944
Mom,

369
00:26:46,978 --> 00:26:48,412
If it's not enough, just tell me.

370
00:26:49,655 --> 00:26:51,329
I do not know why I said that.

371
00:26:52,015 --> 00:26:53,475
You are spoiling me

372
00:26:53,509 --> 00:26:54,648
I am your daughter and I can do it.

373
00:26:54,653 --> 00:26:56,252
I'm not spoiling you. I...

374
00:26:57,351 --> 00:26:58,177
Sweetie.

375
00:26:58,247 --> 00:27:00,120
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I exaggerated.

376
00:27:00,709 --> 00:27:01,948
Beth ...

377
00:27:04,538 --> 00:27:05,722
Are not you angry with me?

378
00:27:05,756 --> 00:27:07,294
Why should I be?

379
00:27:07,452 --> 00:27:10,209
Why did I leave you?
here alone with Vera?

380
00:27:10,243 --> 00:27:11,530
Beth, look at me.

381
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:13,912
You did not abandon me.

382
00:27:14,038 --> 00:27:16,310
You left why you had
and to your own life.

383
00:27:16,344 --> 00:27:17,626
That is perfectly natural.

384
00:27:17,713 --> 00:27:18,794
It is understood?

385
00:27:19,001 --> 00:27:20,580
Dont be like that.

386
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,217
That is my girl.

387
00:27:23,507 --> 00:27:24,931
We are going to give

388
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:40,218
Since when do you drink?
Caipira beer?

389
00:27:52,483 --> 00:27:53,676
Shit.

390
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:56,644
On the edge of the door.

391
00:27:57,118 --> 00:27:58,150
You locked her?

392
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,206
Unloved, she locks herself up.

393
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,045
Hide the key down there.

394
00:28:03,077 --> 00:28:04,328
I made a copy.

395
00:28:06,781 --> 00:28:07,963
Vera?

396
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:09,788
Sweetie?

397
00:28:10,437 --> 00:28:11,762
Are you hidden?

398
00:28:13,663 --> 00:28:14,691
Vera?

399
00:28:19,202 --> 00:28:21,722
The first aid kit, Beth.
In the closet on the left.

400
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:25,569
Vera? Where are you?

401
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:28,679
Sweetie?

402
00:28:29,718 --> 00:28:31,134
The first aid kit, Beth.

403
00:28:31,437 --> 00:28:32,640
Vera?

404
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:39,146
Help me!

405
00:28:39,154 --> 00:28:40,154
Vera!

406
00:28:40,211 --> 00:28:41,729
Mom!

407
00:28:43,006 --> 00:28:43,905
Hold your legs.

408
00:28:44,005 --> 00:28:45,885
Do not!

409
00:28:45,928 --> 00:28:46,949
Beth, move!

410
00:28:47,717 --> 00:28:48,717
Hold your legs.

411
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:49,985
It's okay.

412
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:54,313
Do not...

413
00:28:55,865 --> 00:28:57,543
It's okay. Enter the room.

414
00:29:01,693 --> 00:29:03,304
Help me!

415
00:29:03,338 --> 00:29:04,429
Calm down, Vera!

416
00:29:04,463 --> 00:29:06,287
It's okay. Take it easy.

417
00:29:06,322 --> 00:29:08,329
Help me!

418
00:29:08,363 --> 00:29:09,167
Take it easy.

419
00:29:09,201 --> 00:29:10,730
Bring the kit, Beth.

420
00:29:12,735 --> 00:29:13,735
<i> Look at me. </ i>

421
00:29:14,695 --> 00:29:17,073
<i> It's over, baby. It's over. </ I>

422
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:18,957
<i> How did you do it? </ i>

423
00:29:21,928 --> 00:29:22,979
They hurt me

424
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:24,238
Nobody is going to hurt you.

425
00:29:24,245 --> 00:29:25,329
My sister.

426
00:29:29,545 --> 00:29:30,561
Beth?

427
00:29:32,685 --> 00:29:33,914
I'm here, Vera.

428
00:29:34,296 --> 00:29:35,636
She is watching you.

429
00:29:35,911 --> 00:29:37,656
- Vera.
- She is watching you.

430
00:29:48,639 --> 00:29:51,181
<i> Please tell me how you had
inspiration for this book. </ i>

431
00:29:51,217 --> 00:29:54,358
<i> Of course, it started when
I was doing my Master's Degree. </ i>

432
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:55,269
<i> At The Sorbonne. </ i>

433
00:29:55,303 --> 00:29:59,078
<i> And I ...
I went to the galleries in Paris, </ i>

434
00:29:59,334 --> 00:30:04,377
<i> and there was a gallery that was
with an art exhibit ... </ i>

435
00:30:04,411 --> 00:30:05,809
Do not worry about it.

436
00:30:06,997 --> 00:30:07,997
Come here.

437
00:30:23,435 --> 00:30:24,801
It is difficult right?

438
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:27,599
I know.

439
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:31,961
<i> Active time of year, so that
the artists meet and believe. </ i>

440
00:30:39,803 --> 00:30:41,203
How do you do it, mom?

441
00:30:43,982 --> 00:30:46,076
Last week the
I found in my room.

442
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:48,163
Attached to the heater.

443
00:30:49,787 --> 00:30:51,766
She was screaming like ...

444
00:30:52,889 --> 00:30:55,652
I had to turn around to
see that there was nobody

445
00:30:58,459 --> 00:30:59,565
What I can do?

446
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:03,241
There's nothing you can do, Beth.

447
00:31:06,506 --> 00:31:09,594
She continues to revive
that night, again and again.

448
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,920
Come here.

449
00:31:23,185 --> 00:31:24,264
It's okay.

450
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,269
<i> Where are you? </ i>

451
00:32:20,436 --> 00:32:23,067
<i> Help ...
Help me! </ I>

452
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:13,991
<i> HELP ME! </ i>

453
00:33:29,131 --> 00:33:30,160
Vera?

454
00:33:53,895 --> 00:33:55,930
Are you going to let me die alone?

455
00:33:57,864 --> 00:33:58,864
Do not.

456
00:33:59,178 --> 00:34:00,289
Not alone?

457
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,672
You will not die, Vera.

458
00:34:10,225 --> 00:34:11,948
They are making me pay.

459
00:34:12,701 --> 00:34:14,105
And you are not there.

460
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:16,484
I move...

461
00:34:16,905 --> 00:34:18,351
and they burn me.

462
00:34:18,476 --> 00:34:20,542
I scream and they ...

463
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:24,316
Please.

464
00:34:27,076 --> 00:34:28,159
I am begging you.

465
00:34:28,264 --> 00:34:29,762
Please, tell them.

466
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:32,015
Tell them I'm not a bad girl.

467
00:34:32,049 --> 00:34:32,387
Vera?

468
00:34:32,421 --> 00:34:33,971
Vera, listen to me, okay?

469
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,908
I'm sorry, if I offended them.

470
00:34:35,942 --> 00:34:38,705
Tell them to stop punishing me.

471
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:40,507
You did not do anything wrong.

472
00:34:41,006 --> 00:34:41,614
Tell them.

473
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:44,261
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault, okay?

474
00:34:48,607 --> 00:34:49,418
Are here.

475
00:34:49,452 --> 00:34:50,996
- Vera? It's just mom.
- Vera?

476
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,495
Vera?

477
00:34:56,695 --> 00:34:57,695
The truck.

478
00:34:58,789 --> 00:35:00,481
Oh my God!

479
00:35:03,702 --> 00:35:04,793
The truck.

480
00:35:28,906 --> 00:35:29,906
Mom?

481
00:35:57,257 --> 00:35:58,433
Get lost.

482
00:35:59,086 --> 00:36:00,465
Have you already woken up, honey?

483
00:36:01,414 --> 00:36:02,414
Yes.

484
00:36:03,898 --> 00:36:05,189
Eugene came?

485
00:36:06,773 --> 00:36:08,686
So much crap in this house.

486
00:36:10,242 --> 00:36:11,638
Did he leave the account?

487
00:36:12,804 --> 00:36:14,424
I did not even see it.

488
00:36:19,101 --> 00:36:20,881
<i> What a great day for a field day? </ i>

489
00:36:47,331 --> 00:36:49,600
You still smell Beth.

490
00:36:50,013 --> 00:36:52,518
That smell drives me crazy.

491
00:36:52,826 --> 00:36:54,542
What are you talking about?

492
00:36:54,945 --> 00:36:57,848
I should have eaten you
while you lived here.

493
00:36:58,384 --> 00:37:00,519
Then, you would never leave me.

494
00:37:00,553 --> 00:37:04,090
And no boy
I would bring my girls closer.

495
00:37:04,908 --> 00:37:06,558
Stop drinking, mom.

496
00:37:06,744 --> 00:37:08,935
The flesh of my daughters.

497
00:37:10,088 --> 00:37:11,588
You have no sense

498
00:37:16,588 --> 00:37:17,717
Are you okay, mom?

499
00:37:18,853 --> 00:37:21,049
God, I look like shit.

500
00:37:24,547 --> 00:37:27,376
I do not know where your talent comes from,
Dear.

501
00:37:27,941 --> 00:37:31,064
Your ability to create
your own worlds

502
00:37:41,722 --> 00:37:42,966
It still hurts?

503
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:46,681
Nothing hurts more truth.

504
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,785
You're still cute, mom.

505
00:37:52,419 --> 00:37:54,728
What I am trying
to say is that ...

506
00:37:54,821 --> 00:37:57,037
"Incident in the Land of Ghosts" ...

507
00:37:57,071 --> 00:37:59,825
It's your best novel so far.

508
00:38:01,325 --> 00:38:02,453
Did you read it?

509
00:38:03,202 --> 00:38:04,519
Of course.

510
00:38:05,998 --> 00:38:10,068

I wanted to stop reading. </ i>

why I did not want to bother you. </ i>

Beth.

514

Beth, I miss you.

515
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:23,448
You left me...

516
00:38:24,084 --> 00:38:25,471
All alone

517
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:12,760

526
00:39:57,408 --> 00:39:59,047
Vera, look at me.

527
00:40:00,374 --> 00:40:01,787
Vera, there is no one here!

528

There is nobody, Vera!

529

Mom, where is the key?

Vera is having an attack.

549
00:41:43,593 --> 00:41:45,644
He locked himself in the room.
Where is the key?

550
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:47,966
The key to the room.
Where is?

551

There is no key, dear.

I know what you want from your sister.

I'll wait for
them on the road.

She died, Beth.

637
00:50:36,913 --> 00:50:39,523
You have to let her go.

You come back?

And from mom.

648

You looked at me as if
I was crazy.

You could not hear me.

We came to help.

I have a situation here.

720

Tell me who did this to you.

721
01:12:48,546 --> 01:12:49,692
A witch.

722
01:12:50,168 --> 01:12:51,345
And an ogre.

723
01:12:51,779 --> 01:12:53,401
They came for us.

724
01:12:53,435 --> 01:12:54,771
In Aunt Clarice's house.

725
01:12:54,806 --> 01:12:56,676
Between 14 and 15.

726

Thin.

727
01:12:57,788 --> 01:12:58,540
One is blonde.

728

The other brunette.

Change.

730
01:13:00,301 --> 01:13:02,812
Two damn subjects.

731
01:13:03,059 --> 01:13:04,841
In a candy truck.

732
01:13:05,269 --> 01:13:06,569
A candy truck?

733
01:13:06,583 --> 01:13:07,670
<i> Can you hear me? </ i>

734
01:13:08,205 --> 01:13:09,130

Corner of Holy Flowers and Jackson. </ i>

745
01:13:28,777 --> 01:13:29,949
Send to the team

746
01:13:30,056 --> 01:13:32,367
We're going to take them to the hospital.
And direct to there.

<i> Understood. Change and out. </ I>

749

I got information.

750
01:13:42,823 --> 01:13:44,087
We have to go.

751
01:13:44,666 --> 01:13:45,944
I know where the girls come from.

Look at me!

757
01:14:53,808 --> 01:14:55,149
Came back!

758
01:14:56,039 --> 01:14:57,039
Beth!

Do not.

Do not!

765
01:15:59,638 --> 01:16:00,626
Do you mind putting them over there?

766
01:16:00,661 --> 01:16:02,468
- Yeah right.
- Thank you.

767
01:16:06,494 --> 01:16:07,868
You look wonderful as always.

768

Thank you very much.

769
01:16:09,158 --> 01:16:10,590
- Thanks for coming.
- I appreciate the invitation.

770
01:16:10,614 --> 01:16:12,244
- Of course. Enjoy
- I will do it.

771
01:16:14,874 --> 01:16:16,238
Finishing it.

772
01:16:19,486 --> 01:16:20,724
You are beautiful.

773
01:16:21,196 --> 01:16:22,215
You too.

774
01:16:22,269 --> 01:16:24,289
You're always perfect, honey.

775
01:16:25,845 --> 01:16:28,954
The most beautiful dream in
the most beautiful world.

776
01:16:32,009 --> 01:16:33,055
- Hello.
- Hello.

777
01:16:33,072 --> 01:16:34,549
James, this is my mother.

778
01:16:34,972 --> 01:16:36,232
It's a pleasure to meet you.

779
01:16:37,173 --> 01:16:39,284
Do you think I can
steal it for a minute?

780
01:16:39,347 --> 01:16:40,347
Yes!

781
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:42,472
Here we go.

782
01:16:51,431 --> 01:16:52,698
Thank you.

783
01:16:57,356 --> 01:16:58,545
Say hello to mom

784
01:17:20,556 --> 01:17:22,570
It's not your thing, is it?

785
01:17:26,220 --> 01:17:27,683
Not quite. Do not.

786
01:17:28,744 --> 01:17:30,415
I already imagined it.

787
01:17:30,745 --> 01:17:33,364
It is even less when
I finished reading it.

788
01:17:34,885 --> 01:17:36,244
Oh my God!

789
01:17:37,212 --> 01:17:38,212
What?

790
01:17:40,939 --> 01:17:43,377
I waited all my life
At this moment.

791
01:17:43,411 --> 01:17:45,457
And now it finally arrived and ...

792
01:17:45,909 --> 01:17:47,970
And I would prefer to die to
hear you tell me ...

793
01:17:48,009 --> 01:17:49,029
Your novel ...

794
01:17:50,017 --> 01:17:51,818
It is a masterpiece.

795
01:17:54,345 --> 01:17:55,345
What?

796
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:56,661
You listened to me perfectly.

797
01:17:58,353 --> 01:18:01,121
If you change just one
word in this book ...

798
01:18:02,127 --> 01:18:03,715
I will never talk to you again.

799
01:18:09,587 --> 01:18:10,587
Thank you.

Do not listen to her, Beth.

808

There is nothing else for you there.

809
01:19:13,611 --> 01:19:15,140
She is my sister, mom.

810
01:19:16,412 --> 01:19:19,236
The world is a horrible place,
Dear.

811
01:19:20,314 --> 01:19:21,919
But she is still my sister.

Little by little.

Do it now.

828
01:21:44,923 --> 01:21:45,923
Hands up!

829
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:52,941
Do not move, fuck.

830

Do not do it!

831
01:24:05,024 --> 01:24:06,653
I love you

832
01:25:01,660 --> 01:25:02,667
Okay, Beth.

833
01:25:03,383 --> 01:25:05,757
We are about 30 or 40
minutes from the hospital.

834
01:25:06,736 --> 01:25:08,089
I'm afraid that until then ...

835
01:25:09,572 --> 01:25:10,900
You're stuck with me

836
01:25:14,259 --> 01:25:15,549
You are very strong, did you know?

837
01:25:16,697 --> 01:25:17,769
And very brave.

838
01:25:18,908 --> 01:25:20,234
I bet you like sports.

839
01:25:20,239 --> 01:25:21,742
Do you like sports, Beth?

840
01:25:22,291 --> 01:25:23,291
Do not.

841
01:25:23,650 --> 01:25:24,665
Do not?

842
01:25:25,144 --> 01:25:27,031
Well, I would have lost that bet.

843
