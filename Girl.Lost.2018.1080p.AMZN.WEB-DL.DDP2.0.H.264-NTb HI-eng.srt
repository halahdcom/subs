1
00:00:00,322 --> 00:00:03,072
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:16,472 --> 00:00:19,222
(birds chirping)

3
00:00:20,498 --> 00:00:22,712
(faucet trickling)

4
00:00:22,713 --> 00:00:23,869
- Shit!

5
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,835
(laughing)

6
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:26,955
- You scared me.

7
00:00:26,956 --> 00:00:27,915
(man moaning)

8
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,186
- Where's your mom?

9
00:00:29,211 --> 00:00:30,380
- She's at the store.

10
00:00:30,381 --> 00:00:31,930
She'll be back in like an hour.

11
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:35,690
- You like staying here?

12
00:00:36,749 --> 00:00:38,149
This is a nice place, right?

13
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,733
- Yeah.

14
00:00:40,734 --> 00:00:43,209
- I'm a good guy, huh?

15
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,679
You like me?

16
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,680
- I guess.

17
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,669
- Anything I could help you with?

18
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,147
Anything I can do for you?

19
00:00:53,249 --> 00:00:55,982
I just wanna be there for you, that's all.

20
00:00:55,983 --> 00:00:58,513
Maybe you need a little extra cash.

21
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:02,124
(chuckling)

22
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:03,697
I know you done this before.

23
00:01:04,615 --> 00:01:06,104
- A hundred bucks?

24
00:01:06,175 --> 00:01:07,243
Really?

25
00:01:07,244 --> 00:01:09,063
I'm a little more expensive than my mom.

26
00:01:11,014 --> 00:01:12,042
Ow!

27
00:01:12,043 --> 00:01:13,043
Shit.

28
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,700
- You got just as bad
of a fucking attitude!

29
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:17,798
- What the fuck are you doing?!

30
00:01:17,823 --> 00:01:19,449
Get the fuck away from her!

31
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,225
- Fucking join in, bitch!

32
00:01:21,226 --> 00:01:23,893
(woman yelling)

33
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,167
Teach your bitch kid some fucking manners!

34
00:01:29,596 --> 00:01:31,205
(glass shattering)
(screaming)

35
00:01:31,206 --> 00:01:32,622
Do it, bitch!

36
00:01:32,623 --> 00:01:35,373
(dramatic music)

37
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:39,759
(mother yelling)

38
00:01:46,766 --> 00:01:49,183
(whimpering)

39
00:02:13,985 --> 00:02:16,735
(dramatic music)

40
00:02:51,765 --> 00:02:52,965
- Hey.

41
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:54,204
This has got to stop.

42
00:02:54,205 --> 00:02:55,404
Get your shit together.

43
00:02:55,405 --> 00:02:56,771
We're getting out of here.

44
00:02:56,772 --> 00:02:58,272
Come on, let's go.

45
00:02:59,173 --> 00:03:00,250
Come on!

46
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:01,251
- Okay.

47
00:03:07,581 --> 00:03:10,331
(city commotion)

48
00:03:19,383 --> 00:03:20,383
- Christ.

49
00:03:49,542 --> 00:03:51,042
Throw me my phone.

50
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,060
Thanks.

51
00:03:55,123 --> 00:03:56,123
Shit.

52
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,299
Thank God we've got a guy
coming here in 10 minutes

53
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,813
who can pay for this shit.

54
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,760
Fuck, where's my makeup?

55
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,760
Can you see it?

56
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,720
- Sorta.

57
00:04:16,831 --> 00:04:18,060
But it's pretty dark in here.

58
00:04:18,061 --> 00:04:20,059
He probably won't notice.

59
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,671
- You wanna wait in the
bathroom or the car?

60
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:23,750
- Bathroom.

61
00:04:23,751 --> 00:04:25,219
- Actually, wait in the car.

62
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,323
You're getting too big
to hide in the shower.

63
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,023
- Okay.

64
00:04:31,024 --> 00:04:32,123
Got my vaporizer in there?

65
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,070
Thanks.

66
00:04:35,915 --> 00:04:36,954
- Hey.

67
00:04:36,955 --> 00:04:39,037
You forgetting something?

68
00:04:40,377 --> 00:04:42,317
Give it 45 minutes, Max.

69
00:04:42,318 --> 00:04:43,318
- Okay.

70
00:04:44,936 --> 00:04:47,519
(door closing)

71
00:04:48,551 --> 00:04:51,134
(men chatting)

72
00:04:57,529 --> 00:04:59,239
- [Man] What's up, Nina?

73
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,474
- What's up, girl?

74
00:05:01,475 --> 00:05:05,255
(distant police siren)

75
00:05:05,256 --> 00:05:06,256
- Hey.

76
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:20,680
(birds chirping)

77
00:05:25,565 --> 00:05:27,170
(knocking)

78
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:28,350
- Fix this.

79
00:05:28,351 --> 00:05:30,670
It looks like shit, I'm telling you.

80
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,367
Hey.

81
00:05:33,368 --> 00:05:34,516
- Hola, Kimmy.

82
00:05:34,517 --> 00:05:35,629
(chuckling)

83
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,689
- Oh, come on.

84
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:37,696
Honey, I missed you.

85
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:40,036
Show me some love.

86
00:05:40,037 --> 00:05:41,683
This is my baby girl, Shara.

87
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,260
- Hi.

88
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,300
- Yeah, Cap, how you doing?

89
00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:51,364
All right, fuck it, come on in.

90
00:05:51,365 --> 00:05:53,198
- All right, let's go.

91
00:06:06,218 --> 00:06:08,549
(groaning)

92
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,969
- Room's 300 bucks a month.

93
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,533
All the utilities are included.

94
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,040
You have a small fridge
and a hotplate right there.

95
00:06:17,022 --> 00:06:18,689
- This is so ghetto.

96
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,240
- Get out.

97
00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:26,199
- Is she always fucking like that?

98
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
- Yes.

99
00:06:28,772 --> 00:06:29,772
- Fuck.

100
00:06:33,255 --> 00:06:34,609
Washer and dryer.

101
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,139
If you wanna use that

102
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,571
it's gonna be an extra
hundred bucks a month.

103
00:06:38,572 --> 00:06:41,803
Or you could use the
laundromat down the street

104
00:06:41,842 --> 00:06:42,947
but I don't recommend.

105
00:06:42,948 --> 00:06:45,613
- I'm sure, if we need to use the laundry,

106
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,860
we can work something out.

107
00:06:49,773 --> 00:06:52,023
(giggling)

108
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,306
- I'm sure we can.

109
00:06:54,307 --> 00:06:55,307
- We can.

110
00:06:58,968 --> 00:07:01,349
- She's not gonna be a problem, is she?

111
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,149
Because, you know, I don't usually allow

112
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,422
other people's kids here or anything.

113
00:07:05,423 --> 00:07:06,506
- She's fine.

114
00:07:07,951 --> 00:07:11,514
(water bubbling)

115
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:14,265
(pleasant music)

116
00:07:46,283 --> 00:07:49,450
(somber violin music)

117
00:07:59,551 --> 00:08:00,551
- Hello?

118
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,670
(water sloshing)

119
00:08:11,017 --> 00:08:12,273
Did you enjoy the show?

120
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:14,910
- What show?

121
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,633
So you guys moving in or?

122
00:08:20,926 --> 00:08:22,926
Are you one of my dad's whores?

123
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,270
- Is your dad Cap?

124
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,520
- Yep.

125
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,573
- My mom met your dad in
a court ordered rehab.

126
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,748
They used to fuck.

127
00:08:32,773 --> 00:08:34,623
We're renting a room.

128
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,274
(chuckling)

129
00:08:36,461 --> 00:08:37,507
- Okay.

130
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,098
So I guess we're housemates.

131
00:08:40,471 --> 00:08:41,471
Nice.

132
00:08:43,543 --> 00:08:45,003
By the way,

133
00:08:45,216 --> 00:08:46,216
nice tits.

134
00:08:47,266 --> 00:08:49,193
I know you love it.

135
00:08:52,864 --> 00:08:55,864
(somber beat music)

136
00:09:12,954 --> 00:09:13,954
Here you go.

137
00:09:16,952 --> 00:09:17,957
What?

138
00:09:17,982 --> 00:09:19,042
I thought this was yours.

139
00:09:19,067 --> 00:09:21,618
You shouldn't leave your purse
lying around, what're you doing?

140
00:09:21,643 --> 00:09:23,399
- Not mine.
- Not yours?

141
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,950
Okay, let's see if there's an ID in here.

142
00:09:27,996 --> 00:09:30,000
And there is no ID.

143
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:32,138
Just a bunch of Benjamins.

144
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:34,705
(chuckling)

145
00:09:34,706 --> 00:09:36,849
- Can I have a sip of that?

146
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:37,850
Please.

147
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,139
- You normally take beers from strangers?

148
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,709
- Sorry, what's your name?

149
00:09:42,734 --> 00:09:43,750
- Jamie.

150
00:09:43,775 --> 00:09:45,884
- Jamie, can I have a sip of that?

151
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,069
- Yeah, I guess,

152
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,729
considering I've already seen your tits

153
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,144
and you're crashing at my pad.

154
00:09:53,261 --> 00:09:54,818
Yeah, why not?

155
00:09:54,843 --> 00:09:55,943
You a...

156
00:09:55,968 --> 00:09:57,082
Are you fucking kidding me?

157
00:09:57,107 --> 00:09:58,349
You said a sip, whoa.

158
00:09:59,901 --> 00:10:02,068
(sighing)

159
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:06,005
(people cheering)

160
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:07,006
- All right.

161
00:10:09,288 --> 00:10:10,488
(splashing)

162
00:10:10,489 --> 00:10:13,322
(people cheering)

163
00:10:14,305 --> 00:10:17,979
- Your fascination with my tits
isn't impressing me at all.

164
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,019
- Jesus Christ, I'm sorry, you're hot.

165
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,270
What am I supposed to do?

166
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,189
And you put on a crazy show for me.

167
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:28,939
I ain’t complaining but
I didn't expect that.

168
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,309
- Didn't expect what?

169
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,689
To come home to random some chick

170
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,190
doing back flips in your pool?

171
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,280
- Pretty much, yeah.

172
00:10:36,821 --> 00:10:38,121
- Who said it was for you?

173
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,483
- All I'm saying is that it was hot, shit.

174
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,350
Another beer?

175
00:10:44,445 --> 00:10:46,066
- Do you got anything harder?

176
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:47,599
(laughing)

177
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,063
- What do you want?

178
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,859
- I don't know, vodka?

179
00:10:52,884 --> 00:10:53,884
- Vodka?

180
00:10:56,096 --> 00:10:57,099
Okay.

181
00:10:57,287 --> 00:10:58,496
Let me check.

182
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:01,063
- Actually, nevermind.

183
00:11:01,617 --> 00:11:03,238
I'll see you later.

184
00:11:05,926 --> 00:11:08,926
(somber beat music)

185
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,443
(somber piano music)

186
00:11:28,697 --> 00:11:30,344
- So you know what to do.

187
00:11:30,345 --> 00:11:33,678
He's obviously got dough, which is good.

188
00:11:35,683 --> 00:11:37,382
- How long should I give you?

189
00:11:37,765 --> 00:11:39,915
(moaning)

190
00:11:40,128 --> 00:11:42,119
(coughing)

191
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,919
- If I'm not out in like three hours.

192
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,920
- What?

193
00:11:45,686 --> 00:11:47,345
- Look at this neighborhood, girl.

194
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,370
Time is money.

195
00:12:05,824 --> 00:12:06,657
(whistling)

196
00:12:06,658 --> 00:12:07,978
- Hey, sugar britches, over here.

197
00:12:08,407 --> 00:12:10,315
I'm gonna bring you in through the side.

198
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,094
- Okay.

199
00:12:11,119 --> 00:12:13,026
- It'll be a little more discreet.
- How's yourself?

200
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,822
- Oh, I'm fine, thanks.

201
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,463
- You know, I'm not trying
to be an asshole or anything,

202
00:12:29,601 --> 00:12:31,933
but you look a little older
than I thought you'd be.

203
00:12:32,441 --> 00:12:34,421
I mean, your ad said 27.

204
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:36,864
- Yeah, well, it's bright out here.

205
00:12:38,612 --> 00:12:39,905
- I guess it is.

206
00:12:40,587 --> 00:12:45,137
So who's the little chick
in the car with you?

207
00:12:45,246 --> 00:12:46,896
- My daughter.

208
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,025
And don't ask.

209
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,729
You couldn't afford her.

210
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,370
- Really?

211
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:54,943
Mother, daughter tag-team.

212
00:12:55,698 --> 00:12:56,703
I've never tried that.

213
00:12:56,704 --> 00:12:58,929
It sounds so freaking hot.

214
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:01,280
- Yeah, well, I didn't
say we'd do it together.

215
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,150
Woo!

216
00:13:03,175 --> 00:13:04,372
- Would you?

217
00:13:04,883 --> 00:13:05,883
- Oh.

218
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,377
Five grand.

219
00:13:09,378 --> 00:13:10,474
- Is that all?

220
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:11,601
Done.

221
00:13:11,626 --> 00:13:13,366
We'll save it for next time.

222
00:13:13,391 --> 00:13:17,716
Tonight I'm gonna take mommy
out for a little test drive.

223
00:13:17,741 --> 00:13:20,321
(giggling)

224
00:13:20,413 --> 00:13:21,413
- Okay.

225
00:13:24,832 --> 00:13:27,582
(birds chirping)

226
00:14:10,494 --> 00:14:13,661
(car engine rumbling)

227
00:14:16,483 --> 00:14:19,400
(girls chattering)

228
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:34,684
- She's fucking gross.

229
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,816
(seatbelt alarm beeping)

230
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,208
- Put your seatbelt on.

231
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,559
- You fucking stink.

232
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,839
- What?

233
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,079
You smell.

234
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,207
Like a dirty whore who
just got her ass fucked.

235
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,208
- Really?

236
00:15:30,085 --> 00:15:31,766
(tires screeching)

237
00:15:31,836 --> 00:15:33,091
Are you fucking kidding me?!

238
00:15:33,116 --> 00:15:35,104
You stupid, fucking ungrateful bitch!

239
00:15:35,105 --> 00:15:36,305
Fuck you!

240
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,381
Fuck you!

241
00:15:37,382 --> 00:15:39,989
Once again, you fucked us
out of our living situation!

242
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:42,559
Now I've gotta work double
time to pay for this shit!

243
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,755
You think that's okay?

244
00:15:43,756 --> 00:15:46,329
Is that okay to you, you
stupid little bitch?!

245
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,330
Idiot!

246
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,593
Fuck, damn it!

247
00:15:56,093 --> 00:15:59,010
(Shara whimpering)

248
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,669
(sighing)

249
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,670
You hungry?

250
00:16:13,487 --> 00:16:14,919
Hello?

251
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,066
Are you hungry?

252
00:16:16,067 --> 00:16:17,317
- I don't care.

253
00:16:18,223 --> 00:16:20,291
- Okay, you don't care.

254
00:16:20,292 --> 00:16:21,292
Good.

255
00:16:22,072 --> 00:16:24,905
- [Server] Here you go, thank you.

256
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:32,863
(crickets chirping)

257
00:16:36,721 --> 00:16:39,629
- So you're not mad at me anymore?

258
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,103
Don't be mad at me.

259
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,989
You little piglet.

260
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:45,021
Here, eat your fries.

261
00:16:45,022 --> 00:16:47,279
(laughing)

262
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,325
Your soggy fries.

263
00:16:49,326 --> 00:16:50,699
- My favorite soggy fries.

264
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,971
- I know, I got them for you.
(Shara pig snorting)

265
00:16:52,996 --> 00:16:55,209
(laughing)

266
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,423
Oh my gosh.

267
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,373
I know you don't see it,

268
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,924
but I'm doing all this for you.

269
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:08,239
- You're right.

270
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,240
I don't see it.

271
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:12,754
- Okay, feel this.

272
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,960
Stick those fries in
your mouth and feel that.

273
00:17:14,985 --> 00:17:15,880
(laughing)

274
00:17:15,905 --> 00:17:18,234
- I know, I don't wanna gross you out.

275
00:17:18,259 --> 00:17:19,316
- What is that?

276
00:17:19,341 --> 00:17:20,300
- Feel it.

277
00:17:20,325 --> 00:17:21,400
- Mom, what is that?

278
00:17:21,425 --> 00:17:22,542
Is that a scar?

279
00:17:22,683 --> 00:17:23,683
- Hmm.

280
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:28,199
This guy had me facedown
in a bed in a motel room

281
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,919
with a knife like this big.

282
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,049
Tried to cut my head off.

283
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,311
- What?

284
00:17:32,312 --> 00:17:34,038
- Do you fucking blame him though?

285
00:17:34,069 --> 00:17:36,309
(laughing)

286
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,285
You probably wish he did.

287
00:17:38,286 --> 00:17:40,536
(laughing)

288
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,230
Seriously.

289
00:17:47,308 --> 00:17:48,313
Because of me,

290
00:17:48,314 --> 00:17:50,639
you're gonna know how
to avoid fucking sickos.

291
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,319
You're gonna know how to
make money the right way.

292
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,989
How to do this correctly and
not be taken advantage of.

293
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:58,990
You know?

294
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:02,950
I wish I had someone like
me when I first started.

295
00:18:02,989 --> 00:18:04,206
You're so lucky.

296
00:18:04,246 --> 00:18:05,995
You have no idea how lucky you are.

297
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,213
- How come you didn't
tell me this until now?

298
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,360
- I don't know.

299
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,093
Up until now, why would I?

300
00:18:16,944 --> 00:18:19,144
It seems like you're
old enough now to know.

301
00:18:21,089 --> 00:18:22,167
- I guess.

302
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:23,168
- Yeah.

303
00:18:23,862 --> 00:18:25,423
Please get this sauce out of here

304
00:18:25,448 --> 00:18:27,923
because if I stick my
finger in it one more time,

305
00:18:27,948 --> 00:18:28,967
I'm gonna kill you, okay?

306
00:18:28,968 --> 00:18:30,371
- Ew, I just did it.

307
00:18:30,372 --> 00:18:31,418
- That's disgusting.

308
00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:33,079
You're like a little piglet.

309
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,330
(laughing)

310
00:18:43,526 --> 00:18:44,628
(gasping)

311
00:18:44,652 --> 00:18:45,659
- Shit.

312
00:18:45,684 --> 00:18:46,503
(chuckling)

313
00:18:46,528 --> 00:18:47,361
Watch it!

314
00:18:47,386 --> 00:18:49,010
- Relax, I wasn't gonna hit you, shit.

315
00:18:49,035 --> 00:18:49,868
- Really?

316
00:18:49,893 --> 00:18:50,893
- Yeah, really.

317
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,556
Where you going?

318
00:18:53,557 --> 00:18:54,390
- The beach.

319
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,390
- The beach?

320
00:18:56,098 --> 00:18:58,380
Do you want a ride or something or what?

321
00:19:01,411 --> 00:19:02,777
- Yeah.

322
00:19:02,778 --> 00:19:03,778
- Okay.

323
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,780
- Be careful.

324
00:19:08,589 --> 00:19:09,589
- Right.

325
00:19:13,787 --> 00:19:17,037
(pleasant piano music)

326
00:19:49,238 --> 00:19:51,905
(waves rushing)

327
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:59,467
It's pretty here.

328
00:20:02,345 --> 00:20:03,366
- I guess.

329
00:20:03,367 --> 00:20:05,543
I see it so much I don't
really think about it.

330
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,000
- Have you ever thought
about walking into the ocean?

331
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,790
Like, you start at the shore

332
00:20:15,163 --> 00:20:16,413
and you just keep walking

333
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,370
until the water covers up your head

334
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:21,852
and you keep going

335
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:24,547
till you can't.

336
00:20:26,203 --> 00:20:27,553
- And then what, you drown?

337
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,680
- You float away,

338
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,400
to a happier place.

339
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:38,033
- Yeah, I wish it was that easy.

340
00:20:38,034 --> 00:20:39,285
- It's that easy for you.

341
00:20:39,286 --> 00:20:40,689
You have a house.

342
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,263
Your dad seems okay.

343
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,589
- My dad's a fucking tweaker.

344
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:48,363
You can't really take
everything he says too serious.

345
00:20:49,597 --> 00:20:51,249
- Tweaker?

346
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,250
Like meth?

347
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:53,822
- Yeah.

348
00:20:53,823 --> 00:20:54,823
Fucking ice.

349
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,650
- Isn't he worried about his teeth?

350
00:20:58,681 --> 00:20:59,738
(chuckling)

351
00:20:59,739 --> 00:21:01,693
- His teeth are jacked already.

352
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,889
Do you know how much
ice you gotta smoke

353
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,610
for your teeth to rot out?

354
00:21:06,923 --> 00:21:08,103
- No..

355
00:21:08,128 --> 00:21:10,767
Like... every day for a year.

356
00:21:13,344 --> 00:21:14,923
- Do you ever do it?

357
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:21,549
- I'd be lying if I
said I haven't tried it.

358
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,800
It's not really my thing.

359
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,759
Cap let's me do whatever the fuck I want.

360
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,760
Fuck it.

361
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:31,346
It's all good.

362
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:39,041
Hey, look here.

363
00:21:39,949 --> 00:21:40,949
Smile.

364
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:44,990
Perfect.

365
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,960
- Let's do one together.

366
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,100
- Okay.

367
00:21:56,403 --> 00:21:57,529
- Ew.

368
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,530
That's so sick.

369
00:21:58,531 --> 00:22:00,719
Get away from me!

370
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,720
Ugh!

371
00:22:02,878 --> 00:22:05,163
(laughing)

372
00:22:05,164 --> 00:22:06,608
- Oh my god, dude.

373
00:22:06,633 --> 00:22:07,823
- Come here.

374
00:22:07,824 --> 00:22:08,824
- Okay.

375
00:22:11,103 --> 00:22:12,103
- There.

376
00:22:13,057 --> 00:22:14,407
- Wow, you weren't kidding.

377
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,570
(laughing)

378
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:24,589
(coughing)

379
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,590
- This is strong.

380
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,749
Oh god.

381
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,050
Where'd you get that shit?

382
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,646
Okay, listen.

383
00:22:31,647 --> 00:22:36,136
"A former playmate looking for honest,

384
00:22:36,137 --> 00:22:40,338
"Sincere, generous gentlemen for..."

385
00:22:40,339 --> 00:22:41,393
- Former playmate?

386
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,090
- Yeah, I coulda been.

387
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,197
Whatever.

388
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,882
Get up.

389
00:22:50,883 --> 00:22:52,154
- I'm trying to sleep.

390
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:53,469
- [Kim] Don't fuck with me!

391
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,470
Get up!

392
00:22:55,238 --> 00:22:56,238
- Shit.

393
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,731
- [Kim] I wanna take some new pics of you.

394
00:22:58,763 --> 00:22:59,714
- What?

395
00:22:59,739 --> 00:23:00,872
- [Kim] You should have your own ad.

396
00:23:00,896 --> 00:23:02,062
- No way.

397
00:23:02,063 --> 00:23:03,621
- [Kim] Yeah way, sit up.

398
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,399
Just take another hit, it'll relax you.

399
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,949
Stop acting like an idiot!

400
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:08,783
(camera snapping)

401
00:23:08,784 --> 00:23:09,870
Sit up on your knees.

402
00:23:09,909 --> 00:23:10,937
- I am.

403
00:23:10,962 --> 00:23:12,108
- [Kim] Drop the sheet.

404
00:23:14,737 --> 00:23:16,326
Just relax, okay?

405
00:23:16,327 --> 00:23:19,011
Get your hair out of your face.

406
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:22,659
Give me a little, sexy smile.

407
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,943
- Like this?

408
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:24,995
(camera snapping)

409
00:23:24,996 --> 00:23:26,141
- Ass in the air.

410
00:23:26,142 --> 00:23:27,889
(camera snapping)

411
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:29,429
Show me that butt.

412
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,583
You look gorgeous.

413
00:23:32,133 --> 00:23:34,534
Give me the look of sex.

414
00:23:34,535 --> 00:23:37,368
(camera snapping)

415
00:23:48,814 --> 00:23:50,339
Just do what he wants, okay?

416
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,065
He paid for an hour but
it's a 45 minute hour.

417
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:54,799
I'll bang on the door when the time's up.

418
00:23:54,824 --> 00:23:55,920
Just stop it!

419
00:23:55,921 --> 00:23:57,923
Your hair looks like fucking shit.

420
00:23:58,918 --> 00:23:59,933
- Ow.

421
00:23:59,934 --> 00:24:01,643
- Just relax. Jesus.

422
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,409
Okay, okay, listen.

423
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,216
Let me give you the
harsh reality, all right?

424
00:24:07,217 --> 00:24:10,309
We've got no money, we've
got no place to stay.

425
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,349
We got nothing.

426
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,418
All we have is you and me.

427
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:15,209
I could go in there right now

428
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:17,594
and make enough money to
pay the rent for one week.

429
00:24:17,595 --> 00:24:20,999
You go in, you pay the
rent for two weeks, get it?

430
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,703
All these sick fucks want young.

431
00:24:25,373 --> 00:24:26,828
Here.

432
00:24:26,829 --> 00:24:28,820
Take a hit of this.

433
00:24:28,821 --> 00:24:30,406
It'll relax you.

434
00:24:30,407 --> 00:24:31,519
Not too much.

435
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,003
Don't wanna stink.

436
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,079
All right, ready?

437
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,080
Let's go.

438
00:24:41,095 --> 00:24:43,345
(knocking)

439
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:48,770
Hi.

440
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,059
- Hi.

441
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,309
(giggling)

442
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,560
- [Kim] Thanks.

443
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:10,930
- Come on.

444
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:29,973
Are you nervous?

445
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:32,439
- Um.

446
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,440
- Don't be.

447
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,950
Come on, let's have a little fun.

448
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,090
Have you ever tried blow?

449
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,820
- Yeah.

450
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,230
- Come here.

451
00:25:55,666 --> 00:25:56,666
Here.

452
00:26:07,789 --> 00:26:10,122
(sniffling)

453
00:26:12,323 --> 00:26:14,599
(laughing)

454
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,813
You're no joke.

455
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,433
I wanna see you dance.

456
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,739
Will you dance for me?

457
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,323
- There's no music.

458
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:30,589
- Sing.

459
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,740
- No way.

460
00:26:36,064 --> 00:26:37,673
- Hum?

461
00:26:37,674 --> 00:26:40,007
(laughing)

462
00:26:41,237 --> 00:26:43,820
(humming tune)

463
00:26:46,422 --> 00:26:49,005
(somber music)

464
00:27:09,905 --> 00:27:12,155
(laughing)

465
00:27:16,832 --> 00:27:18,159
(giggling)

466
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,063
- You're kinda hot for an older guy.

467
00:27:21,064 --> 00:27:22,699
- Older guy?

468
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,897
Since when did I become the older guy?

469
00:27:26,249 --> 00:27:27,615
Shit.

470
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,866
(laughing)

471
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:35,410
(dramatic music)

472
00:27:38,931 --> 00:27:40,098
Dance with me.

473
00:27:45,802 --> 00:27:48,552
(dramatic music)

474
00:27:55,189 --> 00:27:56,689
I just wanna look.

475
00:27:58,931 --> 00:28:01,681
(dramatic music)

476
00:28:22,505 --> 00:28:25,505
(crickets chirping)

477
00:28:29,772 --> 00:28:30,895
- Hey.

478
00:28:30,896 --> 00:28:32,386
- Hey.

479
00:28:32,387 --> 00:28:33,973
- You just get in or?

480
00:28:35,021 --> 00:28:36,071
- A little while ago.

481
00:28:39,133 --> 00:28:40,466
- I'm exhausted.

482
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,620
Wanna?

483
00:28:44,357 --> 00:28:45,357
- I'm good.

484
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:51,513
- Oh, I almost forgot, shit.

485
00:28:53,146 --> 00:28:54,293
I got this for you.

486
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,380
- Thanks.

487
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,500
- Yeah.

488
00:29:04,972 --> 00:29:07,921
- Why are you being so nice to me?

489
00:29:07,922 --> 00:29:09,513
- You're so fucking cool.

490
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,453
You get me.

491
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,913
You don't judge me.

492
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,210
You're so different from
everybody else I've met.

493
00:29:22,992 --> 00:29:25,592
I don't know, most girls
in Venice are just bitches.

494
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:29,910
- How do you know I'm not a bitch?

495
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,529
- Are you?

496
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:34,079
- Sometimes.

497
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,080
If you're a dick.

498
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:37,970
- Never.

499
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:42,139
- Yeah, that's what they all say.

500
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,140
- Okay.

501
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,880
That's kinda harsh.

502
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,880
- It's just,

503
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,539
I've seen my mom get fucked over

504
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:53,899
like a thousand times by guys

505
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,753
and it's getting old.

506
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,405
- Maybe it's a problem.

507
00:29:59,406 --> 00:30:02,393
She's kinda rough, no offense.

508
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:04,940
- It's not her fault.

509
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:08,173
She's just totally fucked up.

510
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,659
- Obviously.

511
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,660
- Seriously.

512
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,035
My mom never had a family.

513
00:30:20,036 --> 00:30:22,733
She started stripping at 18.

514
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:26,020
She had nothing and she
had to take care of me.

515
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,530
She could've easily given me up.

516
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,720
So,

517
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,543
considering all that,

518
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:37,303
she's done pretty okay.

519
00:30:40,074 --> 00:30:43,062
- I really don't get
why you keep doing this.

520
00:30:43,063 --> 00:30:44,289
- Doing what?

521
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:46,289
- Like defending her.

522
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:48,003
- All we have is each other.

523
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,603
Thanks for thinking of me.

524
00:30:56,038 --> 00:30:57,038
- Everyday.

525
00:31:06,063 --> 00:31:07,071
Fuck.

526
00:31:07,096 --> 00:31:08,046
Whoa.

527
00:31:08,046 --> 00:31:09,029
(giggling)

528
00:31:09,054 --> 00:31:10,054
All right.

529
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,092
- You want another show?

530
00:31:13,093 --> 00:31:14,867
- Whoa, what're you doing?

531
00:31:14,868 --> 00:31:15,868
- What?

532
00:31:19,849 --> 00:31:20,932
- Look at me.

533
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:24,803
I really like you.

534
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:29,893
- Did I do something wrong?

535
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:32,790
I'm sorry.

536
00:31:35,456 --> 00:31:36,456
- Listen.

537
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:40,146
(somber music)

538
00:32:27,997 --> 00:32:31,539
(Shara giggling)

539
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,563
- You ever try ice?

540
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,480
- I smoke weed.

541
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,640
- Wanna try some?

542
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,122
There you go.

543
00:32:39,147 --> 00:32:40,102
- Whoa, whoa.

544
00:32:40,127 --> 00:32:40,988
What're you doing?

545
00:32:40,988 --> 00:32:41,821
What about your teeth?

546
00:32:41,821 --> 00:32:42,821
- I'm just trying it.

547
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:45,255
- Let me do it for you then.

548
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,280
Shit.

549
00:32:57,663 --> 00:32:59,913
(coughing)

550
00:33:01,443 --> 00:33:02,610
You all right?

551
00:33:04,342 --> 00:33:05,342
- Yeah.

552
00:33:08,288 --> 00:33:09,739
- Oh hell yeah.

553
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,199
Get it boy.

554
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,749
God, that shit turns bitches on.

555
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,354
I love it.

556
00:33:14,355 --> 00:33:15,605
This is better than porn.

557
00:33:17,049 --> 00:33:18,772
(giggling)

558
00:33:18,773 --> 00:33:21,690
(shower trickling)

559
00:33:37,821 --> 00:33:38,880
- Sorry.

560
00:33:38,881 --> 00:33:40,880
I'll be out in a minute.

561
00:33:44,947 --> 00:33:47,280
(urinating)

562
00:34:06,715 --> 00:34:08,965

He said we could use the

What are you doing? Let's go! Let's go!

583
00:35:18,596 --> 00:35:20,072
Goddamn fuck!

584
00:35:20,073 --> 00:35:22,733
I told you not to fucking touch her, man!

585
00:35:26,014 --> 00:35:27,014
Let's go.

586
00:35:30,637 --> 00:35:33,470
Come on, baby, let's go, let's go.

587
00:35:36,014 --> 00:35:38,681
(ominous music)

588
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:00,104
Cap has a stash.

589
00:36:00,105 --> 00:36:01,605
Well, had a stash.

590
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:05,793
Fuck, it's only 260 bucks.

591
00:36:08,547 --> 00:36:11,999
I need a drink or ice or
something to get this edge off.

592
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,826
Baby, you want something?

593
00:36:13,827 --> 00:36:15,077
- I don't care.

594
00:36:19,855 --> 00:36:22,766
- Everything's going
to be okay, all right?

595
00:36:22,767 --> 00:36:25,256
Don't worry about it.

596
00:36:25,257 --> 00:36:26,840
I'll be right back.

597
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:45,016
(faucet rushing)

598
00:37:00,572 --> 00:37:03,905

00:37:13,484 --> 00:37:15,651
(sighing)

600
00:37:17,946 --> 00:37:20,779
(water trickling)

601
00:37:23,747 --> 00:37:24,926
Yo, babe, where you at?

602
00:37:24,927 --> 00:37:27,214
- [Shara] Just a minute.

603
00:37:27,215 --> 00:37:28,215
- Okay.

604
00:37:44,351 --> 00:37:45,859
What're you, on the rag?

605
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:46,860
- Huh?

606
00:37:47,741 --> 00:37:48,824
I don't know.

607
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:53,065
- Did he do that to you?

608
00:37:53,066 --> 00:37:54,233
- He didn't touch me.

609
00:38:00,257 --> 00:38:02,924
(waves rushing)

610
00:38:04,292 --> 00:38:07,650
(seagulls squawking)

611
00:38:07,651 --> 00:38:10,307
I can't believe we're on our own.

612
00:38:10,308 --> 00:38:11,508
What're we gonna do now?

613
00:38:12,389 --> 00:38:13,389
- About what?

614
00:38:15,327 --> 00:38:17,309
- We kinda blew all the money already

615
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:19,727
and I'm worried about you getting caught.

616
00:38:21,409 --> 00:38:22,490
- Don't worry about it, Hun.

617
00:38:22,491 --> 00:38:23,863
I got a plan.

618
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,840
- What?

619
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,039
- Sweetheart, we're not going back, okay?

620
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,249
We're moving forward and
everything's gonna be okay.

621
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,862
No more bullshit, you hear me?

622
00:38:33,863 --> 00:38:35,545
- Okay.

623
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:38,713
(exciting beat music)

624
00:38:47,855 --> 00:38:49,855
- What's happening, man?

625
00:38:50,649 --> 00:38:51,619
My man!

626
00:38:51,644 --> 00:38:52,621
- What's happening?

627
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:53,454
- How you been?

628
00:38:53,455 --> 00:38:54,484
- Word.

629
00:38:54,485 --> 00:38:55,318
You ready?

630
00:38:55,318 --> 00:38:56,151
- Yeah.

631
00:38:56,152 --> 00:38:57,318
- Let's do it.

632
00:38:59,688 --> 00:39:02,438
(exciting music)

633
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:05,375
- Jill.

634
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,383
- Hi.

635
00:39:11,383 --> 00:39:12,383
- Hi.

636
00:39:13,042 --> 00:39:14,469
- Can you get this one suited up?

637
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:15,470
- Sure.

638
00:39:21,208 --> 00:39:22,689
- How is Cap?

639
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:23,690
- Fucked up.

640
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:29,753
- Kristi will take over from here.

641
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,510
- Well hello, Kristi.

642
00:39:38,102 --> 00:39:40,519
(beat music)

643
00:39:48,894 --> 00:39:49,943
(bottle clinking)

644
00:39:49,944 --> 00:39:51,861
Yo, these just came in.

645
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,349
- Leave it there.

646
00:40:05,205 --> 00:40:07,955
(dramatic music)

647
00:40:23,034 --> 00:40:25,451
- God, you're so fucking hot.

648
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:28,890
You like staying here?

649
00:40:31,565 --> 00:40:34,783
- It just needs some flowers,
then it'll be perfect.

650
00:40:34,784 --> 00:40:36,867
Like our own little home.

651
00:40:39,202 --> 00:40:40,285
- You got it.

652
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:43,263
Tomorrow.

653
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,264
Flowers.

654
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:49,359
- Daisies.

655
00:40:50,811 --> 00:40:51,811
- Daisies?

656
00:40:54,834 --> 00:40:57,501
(sensual music)

657
00:41:44,109 --> 00:41:46,859
(sexual moaning)

658
00:41:58,456 --> 00:42:00,873
(beat music)

659
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:03,390
- There she is.

660
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,041
Miss America.

661
00:42:06,042 --> 00:42:07,689
(laughing)

662
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:09,789
- Hey, my friend's talking
to you, Miss America,

663
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:10,913
don't be rude!

664
00:42:10,938 --> 00:42:11,613
- Ow.

665
00:42:11,614 --> 00:42:13,193
- Bet you got a virgin ass, hooker.

666
00:42:13,194 --> 00:42:14,277
- Get off me!

667
00:42:15,761 --> 00:42:17,549
If I'm a hooker than you owe me this.

668
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:18,550
- The hell I do!

669
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:20,449
Give it back!

670
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:22,836
- Back the fuck off of me!

671
00:42:22,837 --> 00:42:23,670
Pervert!

672
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:24,520
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

673
00:42:24,521 --> 00:42:26,118
- This little bitch just stole my money.

674
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:26,952
- Hey, asshole!

675
00:42:26,952 --> 00:42:27,817
- Check her tits! Check her tits!

676
00:42:27,818 --> 00:42:29,354
She's got 250 in there.

677
00:42:29,355 --> 00:42:30,438
- Stupid ass!

678
00:42:31,552 --> 00:42:32,552
- Come on.

679
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,877
(whimpering)

680
00:42:41,769 --> 00:42:43,936
(yelling)

681
00:42:47,005 --> 00:42:49,922
(glass shattering)

682
00:43:00,095 --> 00:43:02,178
(crying)

683
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:14,119
- What the fuck happened tonight?

684
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,739
Did you rip some guy off or what?

685
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:18,503
- He stuck his finger up my
ass and he called me a hooker.

686
00:43:18,528 --> 00:43:20,174
- Maybe you shouldn't be wearing a skirt

687
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:22,659
with your fucking ass hanging out of it.

688
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:25,189
- I could be walking around naked.

689
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:29,009
That doesn't give him or anyone
the right to do that to me.

690
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:31,099
- Spoken like a true fucking
whore, congratulations.

691
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,879
Did your mom teach you that bullshit?

692
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,323
- My mom taught me not to
give anything away for free!

693
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,521
So no, I didn't steal anyone's money.

694
00:43:40,546 --> 00:43:41,683
He owed me.

695
00:43:41,684 --> 00:43:43,006
- So you Ar a whore?

696
00:43:43,031 --> 00:43:44,018
I knew it.

697
00:43:44,043 --> 00:43:45,007
I fucking knew it.

698
00:43:45,008 --> 00:43:46,809
- You don't have any idea.

699
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:48,089
- I have no idea?

700
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:49,389
I have a fucking idea, babe.

701
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:51,019
I saw those sick fucking pictures of you

702
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,707
on your mom's computer.

703
00:43:52,708 --> 00:43:53,929
- What?

704
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:55,669
You were creeping on her computer?

705
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:56,914
What the fuck is wrong with you?

706
00:43:56,915 --> 00:43:57,748
- What's wrong with me?

707
00:43:57,748 --> 00:43:58,581
You're the fucking whore!

708
00:43:58,582 --> 00:44:02,259
- My mom made me take those pictures.

709
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,119
- She made you take those pictures.

710
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,349
She made you stick your ass in there

711
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:08,622
and make those stupid
duck lips at the camera?

712
00:44:08,623 --> 00:44:10,913
What, are you fucking joking me right now?

713
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:14,609
Maybe you should just go back to whoring.

714
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,389
It seems to work best for you.

715
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:17,993
- Fuck you!

716
00:44:18,886 --> 00:44:20,219
Fuck you!

717
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:21,137

719
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:22,909
- Fuck me?!

720
00:44:22,909 --> 00:44:23,909
Huh?!

721
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:27,319
Why don't you just go
fucking cut yourself, baby?!

722
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,153
Don't think I haven't noticed

723
00:44:28,154 --> 00:44:30,029
this fucking bullshit on your leg!

724
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:32,333
You fucking psychopath
motherfucking bitch!

725
00:44:33,497 --> 00:44:35,194
(crying)

726
00:44:35,195 --> 00:44:36,963
- How could you say that to me?

727
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:49,439
- I can't believe,

728
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,589
I can't even fucking believe
I thought I loved you.

729
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:54,673
(crying)

730
00:44:57,685 --> 00:44:58,785
- Where are you going?

731
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:05,713
Please don't go.

732
00:45:07,047 --> 00:45:08,047
I'm sorry.

733
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:12,675
I'm sorry.

734
00:45:13,578 --> 00:45:14,578
I'm sorry.

735
00:45:16,444 --> 00:45:17,444
- No.

736
00:45:18,155 --> 00:45:22,855
- Please.
(sobbing)

737
00:45:23,915 --> 00:45:26,328
Please don't leave me.

738
00:45:26,329 --> 00:45:27,859
Please.

739
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:30,987
- Get the fuck away from me, you slut.

740
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:36,514
(crying)

741
00:45:39,207 --> 00:45:41,374
(yelling)

742
00:45:42,451 --> 00:45:45,118
(ominous music)

743
00:45:47,751 --> 00:45:48,751
- Fuck!

744
00:46:01,051 --> 00:46:03,301
(coughing)

745
00:46:11,961 --> 00:46:14,211

(groaning)

749
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:58,860
Fuck!

750
00:47:00,976 --> 00:47:03,299
(thudding)

751
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,956
(speaking foreign language)

752
00:47:05,957 --> 00:47:08,124
(yelling)

753
00:47:09,843 --> 00:47:12,175
- Shut the fuck up, bitch!

754
00:47:12,176 --> 00:47:13,210
Shut the fuck up!

755
00:47:13,211 --> 00:47:15,919
(women whimpering)

756
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:17,808
What the fuck are you talking about?!

757
00:47:17,833 --> 00:47:19,179
Shut up, bitch!

758
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:21,602
Don't say another motherfucking word!

759
00:47:21,627 --> 00:47:22,568
- Please, just--

760
00:47:22,593 --> 00:47:23,590
- Shut up!

761
00:47:23,615 --> 00:47:24,977
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, okay?

762
00:47:25,001 --> 00:47:26,221
- Shut up, bitch!

763
00:47:26,246 --> 00:47:27,649
(smacking)

764
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:28,939
- [Woman] God!

765
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:30,395
- [Man] Shut the fuck up!

766
00:47:30,396 --> 00:47:32,063
- [Woman] I'm sorry.

767
00:47:34,965 --> 00:47:37,582
- [Man] Don't tell me what to do!

768
00:47:37,583 --> 00:47:39,779
- [Woman] I'm sorry.

769
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:41,113
- [Man] Shut up!

770
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:46,520

771
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,670
(birds chirping)

772
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:10,519
- You got the money for last night?

773
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,379
Your boyfriend said he would pay today.

774
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:14,594
I can't keep letting you without pay.

775
00:48:14,595 --> 00:48:16,569
- Yeah, I'm gonna go meet him right now.

776
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:17,636
He has it.

777
00:48:17,637 --> 00:48:19,759
- Get it to me by 5PM.

778
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,196
If not, you're out!

779
00:48:21,197 --> 00:48:22,197
- Okay.

780
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:40,231
(giggling)

781
00:48:47,879 --> 00:48:50,629
(dramatic music)

782
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:12,890
- Hey.

783
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:14,890
You okay?

784
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,579
- [Shara] Yeah.

785
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:18,580
- Hop in.

786
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:24,220
You're all right, I won't bite.

787
00:49:31,309 --> 00:49:32,744
What are you doing walking around

788
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:34,300
in a neighborhood like this
in the middle of the night?

789
00:49:34,324 --> 00:49:35,898
You know how dangerous that is?

790
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,899
- Yeah.

791
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:40,303
- You're lucky you found
me and not some lunatic.

792
00:49:46,839 --> 00:49:48,830
Will that help?

793
00:49:48,831 --> 00:49:50,331
- Yeah, thank you.

794
00:49:51,819 --> 00:49:52,819
Thank you.

795
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:57,433
- All right, let's do this.

796
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:02,693
- I didn't know.

797
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,559
- Hooker school 101,

798
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:09,379
you negotiate before you get in the car.

799
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:11,723
Don't tell me you're standing
here for your health.

800
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:17,899
You wanna make the 20 bucks or not?

801
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:21,787
If you don't you can give
it back and you can get out.

802
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:34,257
- Okay, okay.

803
00:50:34,258 --> 00:50:35,675
- That's my girl.

804
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:39,460
(dramatic music)

805
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:52,000
(man yelling)

806
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:56,259
(coughing)

807
00:51:09,635 --> 00:51:12,385
(dramatic music)

808
00:52:11,593 --> 00:52:14,343
(birds chirping)

809
00:52:18,418 --> 00:52:21,168
(metal clanking)

810
00:52:29,861 --> 00:52:32,632
(chuckling)

811
00:52:32,633 --> 00:52:34,133
- [Cap] Douchebag.

812
00:52:36,597 --> 00:52:39,597
(riders chattering)

813
00:52:54,611 --> 00:52:56,861
(knocking)

814
00:53:13,952 --> 00:53:16,202
(groaning)

815
00:53:25,488 --> 00:53:27,655
(sighing)

816
00:53:35,042 --> 00:53:37,792
(birds chirping)

817
00:53:48,626 --> 00:53:49,626
- Yo!

818
00:53:50,619 --> 00:53:51,619
- Ow.

819
00:53:52,777 --> 00:53:54,653
- What the hell are you
doing in my backyard?

820
00:53:54,654 --> 00:53:56,186
- Hi.

821
00:53:56,187 --> 00:53:57,187
Sorry.

822
00:53:57,741 --> 00:53:58,793
How are you?

823
00:53:58,794 --> 00:54:00,139
- How am I? I'm fucking fabulous.

824
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:01,170
What're you doing here?

825
00:54:01,195 --> 00:54:02,195
- Well,

826
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:06,023
remember when you offered
me a hundred dollars?

827
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:09,460
- Yeah.

828
00:54:11,233 --> 00:54:12,440
- I was just wondering

829
00:54:12,441 --> 00:54:14,640
how much you'd offer
me for the whole thing.

830
00:54:19,001 --> 00:54:20,473
- What is it you need?

831
00:54:22,015 --> 00:54:23,907
- A place to stay for awhile.

832
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,913
(groaning)

833
00:54:34,914 --> 00:54:37,685
- Tell me what a fucking slut you are!

834
00:54:37,686 --> 00:54:40,103
(whimpering)

835
00:54:59,274 --> 00:55:01,099
Can I offer you a cocktail?

836
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:02,100
- Thanks.

837
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:07,897
- What're you on?

838
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:11,914
Instagram or Twitter
or some shit like that?

839
00:55:11,915 --> 00:55:12,915
- Mhmm.

840
00:55:16,385 --> 00:55:17,385
- So...

841
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:19,530
How's your mom?

842
00:55:21,438 --> 00:55:22,879
Not that I actually give a shit.

843
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,663
I just thought I'd be nice.

844
00:55:25,926 --> 00:55:26,962
You know,

845
00:55:26,963 --> 00:55:27,963
the only reason

846
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:30,640
I let you and your mom stay here before

847
00:55:32,056 --> 00:55:33,056
was because of you.

848
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:37,773
I really feel like we have a connection.

849
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:40,260
Age

850
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:43,099
shouldn't matter,

851
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:44,100
you know?

852
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:48,193
Age is just a number.

853
00:55:51,435 --> 00:55:54,953
That thing that happened
between me and your mom.

854
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,320
Stupid fight.

855
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:00,750
Your mom,

856
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:03,409
she pushed me there, you know?

857
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:04,563
You know how she is.

858
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:07,260
Really wasn't my fault.

859
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:11,250
Anyway.

860
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,120
Glad you're here.

861
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:23,777
Nice of me to let you stay here, huh?

862
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:37,643
God, you are perfect.

863
00:56:51,591 --> 00:56:53,758
(sighing)

864
00:57:22,029 --> 00:57:23,029
Suck it.

865
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:36,420
(coughing)

866
00:57:37,273 --> 00:57:39,316
(chuckling)

867
00:57:39,317 --> 00:57:42,317
Goddamn, you're a sexy little bitch.

868
00:57:45,574 --> 00:57:48,241
(ominous music)

869
00:58:31,482 --> 00:58:32,619
- Hi.

870
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:33,620
- Yeah?

871
00:58:34,136 --> 00:58:35,782
- I'm here about the job.

872
00:58:35,807 --> 00:58:38,007
- You're the girl I talked
on the phone earlier.

873
00:58:38,032 --> 00:58:40,053
- Mhmm.
- Yeah.

874
00:58:40,713 --> 00:58:41,860
Yeah, follow me.

875
00:58:50,162 --> 00:58:51,162
- I'm 18,

876
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:54,087
five, two.

877
00:58:54,088 --> 00:58:56,163
Long dark hair.

878
00:58:57,210 --> 00:58:58,210
B-cup.

879
00:58:59,550 --> 00:59:01,126
What do you say, baby?

880
00:59:01,127 --> 00:59:02,403
You wanna come by?

881
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:06,209
I have a girlfriend here too.

882
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:08,010
If you want to play with both of is.

883
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:10,793
- Come, come in.

884
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:13,550
Don't be scared.

885
00:59:14,488 --> 00:59:15,654
Come closer.

886
00:59:15,757 --> 00:59:16,910
(chuckling)

887
00:59:16,911 --> 00:59:18,163
What are you? Runaway?

888
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:23,573
Am I going to see your face
on a milk carton anytime soon?

889
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:26,599
- No.

890
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:29,163
My parents are dead, so
you don't have to worry.

891
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:33,273
- Are you aware of what exactly this is?

892
00:59:33,864 --> 00:59:35,120
- I've done it before.

893
00:59:35,121 --> 00:59:37,249
- What have you done before?

894
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:40,722
- Like, with guys and stuff for money.

895
00:59:40,723 --> 00:59:44,390
(speaking foreign language)

896
00:59:47,977 --> 00:59:51,199
- I have a very rich clientele.

897
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,659
VIP.

898
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:55,039
VIP only.

899
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:59,259
That means famous actors,
Hollywood producers,

900
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:00,333
business men.

901
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:04,259
Very, very important people.

902
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:05,260
Got it?

903
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:10,116
You get a thousand dollars an hour

904
01:00:10,117 --> 01:00:12,139
and I'll keep 40 percent.

905
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:14,889
And this is the best deal you can find.

906
01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:16,419
Trust me.

907
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:19,589
Most people take 60, 70 percent

908
01:00:19,590 --> 01:00:21,173
and some take it all.

909
01:00:22,813 --> 01:00:24,982
So what are you willing to do?

910
01:00:25,007 --> 01:00:26,030
- I don't know.

911
01:00:26,031 --> 01:00:30,259
- Can you do girls on girls,
double penetration, anal?

912
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:33,543
Any specific fetishes?

913
01:00:35,690 --> 01:00:38,578
I have this client, he gets off on

914
01:00:38,579 --> 01:00:40,979
sexual necrophilia.

915
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:43,939
(laughing)

916
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:45,343
Most girls love it.

917
01:00:46,217 --> 01:00:48,259
You have to pretend you enjoy yourself.

918
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:49,563
Just pretend you're dead.

919
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:51,550
Very easy.

920
01:00:52,622 --> 01:00:53,713
You can do it, right?

921
01:00:53,714 --> 01:00:55,199
- Mhmm.

922
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,529
- Are you okay with C.O.F., B.B.B.J?

923
01:00:58,530 --> 01:00:59,958
- Sorry?

924
01:00:59,959 --> 01:01:01,873
(laughing)

925
01:01:01,874 --> 01:01:05,096
(speaking foreign language)

926
01:01:05,097 --> 01:01:08,359
- "C.O.F." is "cum on face."

927
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:11,577
And "B.B.B.J." is "bareback blowjob."

928
01:01:13,050 --> 01:01:14,050
- Okay?

929
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:15,657
- Mhmm.

930
01:01:15,658 --> 01:01:16,889
- Oh my god.

931
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:18,950
Okay, just go with Sero.

932
01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:21,600
I'll talk to you later.

933
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:30,680
- Sit with them.

934
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,469
- Hey.

935
01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:39,519
- Hi.

936
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,079
- You'll learn to check up.

937
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,933
It'll seem like nothing.

938
01:01:42,934 --> 01:01:45,184
(knocking)

939
01:01:56,470 --> 01:01:57,623
- I'll take her.

940
01:02:05,237 --> 01:02:07,056
- How old was that girl?

941
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:08,235
- I don't know.

942
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:09,455
- Come on.

943
01:02:09,456 --> 01:02:14,342
Let me take some pictures of you.

944
01:02:14,343 --> 01:02:18,999
(Sero speaking foreign language)

945
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,179
I can text some clients.

946
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:23,078
They'll want to come to see you.

947
01:02:23,079 --> 01:02:25,645
(speaking foreign language)

948
01:02:25,646 --> 01:02:28,249
(camera snapping)

949
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:29,250
Hi.

950
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:32,869
You should be a professional model.

951
01:02:32,870 --> 01:02:33,870
Oh my God.

952
01:02:37,810 --> 01:02:38,810
Come on, honey.

953
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:40,630
Get in the picture.

954
01:02:41,866 --> 01:02:45,533
(speaking foreign language)

955
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:52,867
Oh my, incredible.

956
01:02:54,905 --> 01:02:55,905
You like snow?

957
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:02,543
Makes you feel sexy, huh?

958
01:03:18,033 --> 01:03:19,179
(thudding)

959
01:03:19,204 --> 01:03:21,872
- What the fuck do you think
you're doing, you little asshole?!

960
01:03:22,495 --> 01:03:23,578
Huh?

961
01:03:23,579 --> 01:03:24,709
(thudding)

962
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:26,269
Get up, you little fucking bitch!

963
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:27,508
You little punk ass!

964
01:03:27,509 --> 01:03:29,002
I'll fucking murder...

965
01:03:29,003 --> 01:03:30,019
(groaning)

966
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:31,907
- I fucking hate you, man!

967
01:03:31,932 --> 01:03:32,994
Fuck!

968
01:03:33,019 --> 01:03:34,086
(groaning)

969
01:03:34,111 --> 01:03:35,286
- Little fucking cunt.

970
01:03:35,287 --> 01:03:37,287
You little motherfucker.

971
01:03:48,833 --> 01:03:51,666
(engine starting)

972
01:03:53,264 --> 01:03:55,307
Come back here, you little motherfucker!

973
01:03:55,308 --> 01:03:57,184
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

974
01:03:57,185 --> 01:03:58,563
You son-of-a-bitch!

975
01:04:04,450 --> 01:04:05,450
- You want some?

976
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:07,160
- Sure.

977
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:17,889
- Safety first.

978
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:18,890
- For sure.

979
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:23,440
- You ever been with a girl before?

980
01:04:25,630 --> 01:04:27,059
- No.

981
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:28,159
- It's no biggie.

982
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:30,129
I mean, everything's basically the same,

983
01:04:30,130 --> 01:04:31,130
just softer.

984
01:04:33,558 --> 01:04:34,558
- Okay.

985
01:04:37,798 --> 01:04:39,989
How long have you been working here?

986
01:04:39,990 --> 01:04:41,109
- Like three months.

987
01:04:41,155 --> 01:04:42,210
It's pretty good.

988
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:44,735
Plus, I wanna get into porn
and this is better for that.

989
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:45,820
- It is?

990
01:04:45,821 --> 01:04:48,553
- Yeah, your price goes up
when you become a porn star.

991
01:04:50,735 --> 01:04:52,049
- What do you mean?

992
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:54,679
- I mean, guys are willing to pay more

993
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:56,599
if they've seen your movies.

994
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,609
I met an agent the other
day and he's gonna help me

995
01:04:58,610 --> 01:05:00,049
get into the industry.

996
01:05:00,050 --> 01:05:02,139
We took a bunch of photos
and he's gonna send them

997
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:04,099
to some big time porn producers.

998
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:05,509
I'm excited.

999
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:06,583
- That's really cool.

1000
01:05:07,504 --> 01:05:09,199
(knocking)

1001
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,200
- Follow my lead.

1002
01:05:18,197 --> 01:05:19,219
Hi.

1003
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:20,220
- Hi.

1004
01:05:26,814 --> 01:05:28,709
If you'd like to take a shower first,

1005
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:30,110
you're more than welcome to.

1006
01:05:31,787 --> 01:05:32,787
- Will you join me?

1007
01:05:34,073 --> 01:05:38,744
♪ I turn my sexy on ♪

1008
01:05:38,745 --> 01:05:43,150
♪ I don't think they're ready for me ♪

1009
01:05:43,151 --> 01:05:47,288
♪ My camera-basking tone ♪

1010
01:05:47,289 --> 01:05:52,289
♪ Will make them lick their lips for me ♪

1011
01:05:56,053 --> 01:05:57,543
- I heard you were great.

1012
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,003
Such a good worker.

1013
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:02,373
Such a beauty.

1014
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:05,380
I'm very happy to have you here.

1015
01:06:06,586 --> 01:06:08,753
(sighing)

1016
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:13,979
- Um.

1017
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:16,253
- You owe Sero for drugs, honey.

1018
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:18,523
I took it out of your pay.

1019
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,089
- What that fuck?

1020
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:22,719
- You think it's free?

1021
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:23,869
Come on.

1022
01:06:23,870 --> 01:06:25,120
- Thanks for the warning.

1023
01:06:28,065 --> 01:06:29,893
- Only because I like you.

1024
01:06:32,458 --> 01:06:34,689
Come back tomorrow, honey.

1025
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:36,949
You're gonna make twice more money.

1026
01:06:36,950 --> 01:06:39,003
Maybe three times with your beauty.

1027
01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:42,070
Oh.

1028
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:46,289
Honey, you're gonna make lots of money.

1029
01:06:46,290 --> 01:06:47,483
I promise you.

1030
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:49,973
Okay? Chop, chop.

1031
01:06:55,561 --> 01:06:58,561
(crickets chirping)

1032
01:07:21,763 --> 01:07:22,763
- Shara!

1033
01:07:25,544 --> 01:07:28,219
Have you been smoking
this shit in my house?

1034
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:29,523
- It's just water vapor.

1035
01:07:30,563 --> 01:07:32,713
- Disrespectful fucking little cunt!

1036
01:07:33,934 --> 01:07:36,705
You gonna get blood on my fucking
furniture, I swear to God!

1037
01:07:36,706 --> 01:07:37,968
(whimpering) Get up!

1038
01:07:37,993 --> 01:07:40,402
Fucking little bitch! You're
worse than your fucking mom!

1039
01:07:40,427 --> 01:07:41,431
- [Shara] No!

1040
01:07:41,456 --> 01:07:42,643
- Shut the fuck up!

1041
01:07:42,698 --> 01:07:44,844
Shut the fuck up! (screaming)
Shut the fuck up!

1042
01:07:44,869 --> 01:07:47,027
(yelling)

1043
01:07:47,028 --> 01:07:49,887
(muffled screaming)

1044
01:07:49,888 --> 01:07:52,221
(screaming)

1045
01:07:53,669 --> 01:07:55,136
(gasping)

1046
01:07:55,137 --> 01:07:56,298
(crying)

1047
01:07:56,299 --> 01:07:57,703
What? What? What? What?

1048
01:07:57,704 --> 01:08:01,024
(muffled screaming)

1049
01:08:01,025 --> 01:08:03,275
(gurgling)

1050
01:08:12,136 --> 01:08:14,386
(coughing)

1051
01:08:20,233 --> 01:08:21,233
- Hey.

1052
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:24,823
- Can I stay with you for a few days?

1053
01:08:29,083 --> 01:08:31,166
(crying)

1054
01:08:55,710 --> 01:08:56,710
- Look.

1055
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:00,849
- That's your parents?

1056
01:09:00,850 --> 01:09:02,199
- Yeah.

1057
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:03,500
We don't talk much though.

1058
01:09:05,270 --> 01:09:07,399
- I don't even know who my dad is.

1059
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:08,500
- Maybe that's better.

1060
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:10,619
- You think?

1061
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:13,099
- Yeah, I mean, what if he's a jerk?

1062
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:14,100
- I guess.

1063
01:09:15,773 --> 01:09:17,519
- Those are the pictures
my agent took of me

1064
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,109
to get into porn.

1065
01:09:19,110 --> 01:09:20,612
What do you think?

1066
01:09:20,613 --> 01:09:22,357
- I think you're beautiful.

1067
01:09:25,435 --> 01:09:26,435
Aren't you scared?

1068
01:09:27,338 --> 01:09:28,805
- Of what?

1069
01:09:28,806 --> 01:09:29,806
- You know,

1070
01:09:30,620 --> 01:09:32,019
of never getting out.

1071
01:09:32,020 --> 01:09:35,306
- When I turn 30, I'm
gonna stop doing this.

1072
01:09:35,307 --> 01:09:38,039
I'm gonna get married and be a housewife.

1073
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:39,953
Have lots of kids and pets.

1074
01:09:43,404 --> 01:09:44,404
I can't wait.

1075
01:10:06,705 --> 01:10:08,599
(phone ringing)

1076
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:09,600
- Hello?

1077
01:10:10,810 --> 01:10:12,759
- Yeah, I'm calling about your ad.

1078
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:14,610
- You wanna come by and play with me?

1079
01:10:15,890 --> 01:10:18,319
- I'm calling about the
girl in the pink dress.

1080
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:20,075
- You're talking to her, sweetie.

1081
01:10:20,076 --> 01:10:21,774
- Okay, whatever.

1082
01:10:21,775 --> 01:10:24,711
Just let me know where you're at.

1083
01:10:24,712 --> 01:10:25,712
Okay.

1084
01:10:28,353 --> 01:10:29,393
Fucking bitch.

1085
01:10:34,468 --> 01:10:35,473
- How are you?

1086
01:10:35,474 --> 01:10:37,133
- Good, how are you?

1087
01:10:41,014 --> 01:10:43,764
(city commotion)

1088
01:10:45,429 --> 01:10:46,581
- Have a nice day.

1089
01:10:46,582 --> 01:10:47,582
- You too.

1090
01:11:05,074 --> 01:11:06,230
- Why, what's going on?

1091
01:11:06,231 --> 01:11:07,243
- Can I talk to you?

1092
01:11:08,350 --> 01:11:09,500
- Let me call you back.

1093
01:11:10,652 --> 01:11:13,402
(city commotion)

1094
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:21,705
- Where did those come from?

1095
01:11:21,706 --> 01:11:24,069
- He said you would know.

1096
01:11:24,070 --> 01:11:25,239
- How'd he find me?

1097
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:26,443
- I don't know.

1098
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:29,340
- I don't want them.

1099
01:11:31,374 --> 01:11:33,979
You can have them or
you can throw them out.

1100
01:11:33,980 --> 01:11:34,980
- Really?

1101
01:11:36,090 --> 01:11:37,090
- Really.

1102
01:11:38,309 --> 01:11:41,309
(somber beat music)

1103
01:11:43,490 --> 01:11:45,319
- Bring all the tips to me.

1104
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:46,370
I'll hold everything.

1105
01:11:47,210 --> 01:11:49,149
If you they want extra, let me know.

1106
01:11:49,150 --> 01:11:50,726
I'll give you the price.

1107
01:11:50,727 --> 01:11:52,977
(giggling)

1108
01:11:54,201 --> 01:11:56,231
(exciting beat music)

1109
01:11:56,232 --> 01:11:58,815
(men cheering)

1110
01:12:10,638 --> 01:12:12,054
- Yes!

1111
01:12:12,055 --> 01:12:13,055
Yes!

1112
01:12:13,958 --> 01:12:16,541
(men cheering)

1113
01:12:17,432 --> 01:12:20,599
(exciting beat music)

1114
01:12:26,467 --> 01:12:27,884
- [Man] Oh, fuck!

1115
01:12:29,915 --> 01:12:31,165
Smack that ass!

1116
01:12:32,622 --> 01:12:35,205
(men cheering)

1117
01:12:45,739 --> 01:12:48,906
(exciting beat music)

1118
01:13:17,035 --> 01:13:19,785
(city commotion)

1119
01:13:23,871 --> 01:13:25,870
(giggling)

1120
01:13:25,895 --> 01:13:27,409
- And then the groom wanted me

1121
01:13:27,410 --> 01:13:29,703
to stick liquorice up his butt.

1122
01:13:31,030 --> 01:13:32,339
- That is so sick.

1123
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:33,749
- Ew.

1124
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:34,936
- Ugh.

1125
01:13:34,937 --> 01:13:36,169
Did you do it?

1126
01:13:36,170 --> 01:13:37,809
- I tried.

1127
01:13:37,810 --> 01:13:40,459
It was like sticking a
wet noodle up a cat's ass.

1128
01:13:40,484 --> 01:13:42,397
- Not happening.
- Okay.

1129
01:13:42,422 --> 01:13:43,560
- Girls, pull it together.

1130
01:13:43,561 --> 01:13:44,839
We have a customer coming up.

1131
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:46,240
Come on, let's go, let's go!

1132
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:50,867
(somber beat music)

1133
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:55,513
- You've never needed this?

1134
01:13:56,051 --> 01:13:57,075
Really?

1135
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:58,166
- No.

1136
01:13:58,167 --> 01:14:00,780
- I feel like I can't
do anything without it.

1137
01:14:00,781 --> 01:14:02,504
(sniffling)

1138
01:14:02,505 --> 01:14:05,523
(dramatic beat music)

1139
01:14:05,524 --> 01:14:08,441
- It's in that pocket, right there.

1140
01:14:09,713 --> 01:14:12,880
(dramatic beat music)

1141
01:14:34,193 --> 01:14:37,110
(women chattering)

1142
01:14:41,296 --> 01:14:43,546
(knocking)

1143
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:47,233
- Hello.

1144
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:50,440
Welcome.

1145
01:14:51,166 --> 01:14:52,266
Are you Alex?

1146
01:14:52,267 --> 01:14:53,267
- Yeah.

1147
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:56,263
Where's the girl I called about?

1148
01:14:56,264 --> 01:14:59,347
(helicopter buzzing)

1149
01:15:01,922 --> 01:15:04,505
(horn honking)

1150
01:15:07,209 --> 01:15:09,509
- Are you sure this is the right spot?

1151
01:15:09,510 --> 01:15:10,510
- I think so.

1152
01:15:13,058 --> 01:15:14,959
- I think we should leave.

1153
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:17,513
- For 500 bucks, I'm staying.

1154
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:20,040
- I guess.

1155
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:24,432
- That's it.

1156
01:15:24,433 --> 01:15:25,433
That's the car.

1157
01:15:34,054 --> 01:15:36,471
(rock music)

1158
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:42,320
- Hey, ladies.

1159
01:15:43,607 --> 01:15:44,607
How are you?

1160
01:15:46,510 --> 01:15:47,929
- Fine.

1161
01:15:47,930 --> 01:15:49,130
- I hope you like metal.

1162
01:15:50,376 --> 01:15:53,459
(intense rock music)

1163
01:16:16,879 --> 01:16:19,459
(thudding)

1164
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:20,849
- This is classy.

1165
01:16:20,850 --> 01:16:23,100
- Yeah, where do you take the bodies?

1166
01:16:28,830 --> 01:16:31,663
(liquid sloshing)

1167
01:16:33,770 --> 01:16:34,902
- Drink this.

1168
01:16:34,903 --> 01:16:36,159
- I don't drink.

1169
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:37,297
- Drink this!

1170
01:16:37,298 --> 01:16:40,381
(intense rock music)

1171
01:16:46,249 --> 01:16:48,279
- Get off me, you pig!

1172
01:16:48,304 --> 01:16:49,387
(screaming)

1173
01:16:49,388 --> 01:16:50,742
- Fucking watch!

1174
01:16:50,743 --> 01:16:52,990

1175
01:16:52,991 --> 01:16:56,074

1176
01:16:57,052 --> 01:16:58,226
- Help!

1177
01:16:58,227 --> 01:17:00,333
- Shut the fuck up!

1178
01:17:00,334 --> 01:17:01,468
You fucking cunt!

1179
01:17:01,493 --> 01:17:02,506
(whimpering)

1180
01:17:02,531 --> 01:17:04,349
You can just fucking sit here and watch!

1181
01:17:04,350 --> 01:17:06,098

1200
01:17:44,645 --> 01:17:46,305
- Tell me what a little slut you are!

1201
01:17:46,306 --> 01:17:48,501
Tell me what a fucking slut you are!

1202
01:17:48,502 --> 01:17:50,669
(yelling)

1203
01:17:51,733 --> 01:17:53,520
- You fucking dump cunt!

1204
01:17:53,521 --> 01:17:55,883
(gagging)

1205
01:17:55,884 --> 01:17:58,967
(intense rock music)

1206
01:18:03,866 --> 01:18:05,781
Get the fuck out of my car.

1207
01:18:05,782 --> 01:18:07,949
(gagging)

1208
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:10,976
(sobbing)

1209
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:16,808
- Did it work?

1210
01:18:16,809 --> 01:18:18,219
- It was good.

1211
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:20,133
- I have to talk to you tomorrow. Just go.

1212
01:18:22,570 --> 01:18:23,570
Hello ladies.

1213
01:18:24,850 --> 01:18:27,609
You did so good.

1214
01:18:27,610 --> 01:18:29,679
I have a present for you.

1215
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:31,093
Go ahead, open it.

1216
01:18:32,030 --> 01:18:33,030
Come on.

1217
01:18:36,010 --> 01:18:38,209
Beauty, isn't it, huh?

1218
01:18:38,210 --> 01:18:40,509
This is my gift to you.

1219
01:18:40,510 --> 01:18:43,163
More than a thousand dollar each.

1220
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:49,179
Well?

1221
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:50,899
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

1222
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:51,900
You can go now.

1223
01:18:53,740 --> 01:18:55,089
- Aren't we getting paid?

1224
01:18:55,090 --> 01:18:57,299
- You said 500 each.

1225
01:18:57,300 --> 01:19:01,579
- Those are pure million
diamond carrot studs.

1226
01:19:01,580 --> 01:19:03,772
Much more than a thousand dollars.

1227
01:19:03,773 --> 01:19:05,779
I already told you that!

1228
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:07,513
Much more than 500!

1229
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:10,853
Don't be dumb.

1230
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:12,897
Just go now.

1231
01:19:13,585 --> 01:19:14,637
Sero.

1232
01:19:14,638 --> 01:19:16,109
- [Sero] Mhmm.

1233
01:19:16,110 --> 01:19:17,559
- Shara can not leave.

1234
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:19,329
There is a customer here for her.

1235
01:19:19,330 --> 01:19:20,919
- So lucky.

1236
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:22,349
- No, I can't.

1237
01:19:22,350 --> 01:19:23,912
I'm feeling really sick.

1238
01:19:23,937 --> 01:19:24,956
I need to go home.

1239
01:19:24,957 --> 01:19:26,231
- But he already paid.

1240
01:19:26,256 --> 01:19:27,261
- No.

1241
01:19:27,286 --> 01:19:28,299
- And he only wants you.

1242
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:29,359
- Come on, you can do it.

1243
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:31,423
Just one more, then you can go home.

1244
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:34,519
You'll be fine, go!

1245
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:35,729
- I'll do it with you.

1246
01:19:35,730 --> 01:19:36,799
- Oh, no, no, no.

1247
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,589
He paid only for one

1248
01:19:38,590 --> 01:19:41,643
and we don't any thinking
they can get freebies.

1249
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:43,999
- I'll wait for you.

1250
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,067
- Okay.

1251
01:19:45,068 --> 01:19:48,735
(speaking foreign language)

1252
01:19:56,971 --> 01:20:01,304
- You're more than welcome
to shower if you need to.

1253
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:14,040
- I don't need a shower.

1254
01:20:15,621 --> 01:20:17,371
But I'm thinking you definitely do.

1255
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:22,233
You look like shit.

1256
01:20:24,714 --> 01:20:26,869
Can you talk to me? Can you say something?

1257
01:20:26,870 --> 01:20:27,870
You're killing me.

1258
01:20:33,973 --> 01:20:35,140
- You left me.

1259
01:20:38,302 --> 01:20:39,302
You left me.

1260
01:20:40,056 --> 01:20:42,072
- It's okay, you're coming with me now.

1261
01:20:42,097 --> 01:20:43,097
- No.

1262
01:20:44,390 --> 01:20:45,390
I'm not.

1263
01:20:47,383 --> 01:20:48,713
I don't trust you.

1264
01:20:55,450 --> 01:20:57,403
- You don't trust me.

1265
01:21:00,550 --> 01:21:02,600
But you're running around with that scum?

1266
01:21:03,666 --> 01:21:05,999
(chuckling)

1267
01:21:07,310 --> 01:21:09,033
Listen, I'm sorry.

1268
01:21:09,883 --> 01:21:10,943
Okay?

1269
01:21:10,944 --> 01:21:12,049
I fucked up.

1270
01:21:12,050 --> 01:21:13,623
Baby, I fucked up.

1271
01:21:16,050 --> 01:21:18,217
I just can't stop thinking about you.

1272
01:21:30,887 --> 01:21:33,149
You're doing blow?

1273
01:21:33,150 --> 01:21:34,363
- You're one to talk.

1274
01:21:36,578 --> 01:21:37,578
- Come on.

1275
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:39,439
Please.

1276
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,053
Please, just come with me.

1277
01:21:42,570 --> 01:21:44,552
We could live our life together,

1278
01:21:44,553 --> 01:21:45,743
like we planned.

1279
01:21:46,705 --> 01:21:48,033
We'll figure it out.

1280
01:21:49,990 --> 01:21:51,463
Baby, you're better than is.

1281
01:21:53,589 --> 01:21:56,299
Don't turn into your mom.

1282
01:21:56,300 --> 01:21:58,550
Please, come on, you're
way better than that.

1283
01:22:02,690 --> 01:22:03,690
Look,

1284
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:08,310
I never told you this

1285
01:22:09,323 --> 01:22:10,583
but it's true.

1286
01:22:16,340 --> 01:22:17,340
I love you.

1287
01:22:21,813 --> 01:22:23,256
- You do?

1288
01:22:23,257 --> 01:22:24,257
- Of course.

1289
01:22:25,415 --> 01:22:28,597
I can't live another second without you.

1290
01:22:34,030 --> 01:22:35,830
- I had a feeling you'd come for me.

1291
01:22:37,752 --> 01:22:39,002
But I can't go.

1292
01:22:42,450 --> 01:22:43,450
They own me now.

1293
01:22:44,891 --> 01:22:46,791
- What the fuck are you talking about?

1294
01:22:47,643 --> 01:22:49,693
- I can't just leave.

1295
01:23:00,250 --> 01:23:02,099
- Just make her pay you for fucking me

1296
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:03,853
and let's get the fuck out of here.

1297
01:23:04,820 --> 01:23:05,983
- It's not that simple.

1298
01:23:07,574 --> 01:23:08,710
- What do you mean it's not?

1299
01:23:08,711 --> 01:23:09,989
It is that simple, baby.

1300
01:23:09,990 --> 01:23:12,003
- Like, trust me.
- It's not.

1301
01:23:12,028 --> 01:23:13,153
- Trust me.

1302
01:23:13,450 --> 01:23:14,450
I got you.

1303
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:18,660
- Fine.

1304
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:21,323
I'll take care of it.

1305
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:23,540
Just leave.

1306
01:23:25,210 --> 01:23:26,210
Go.

1307
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,630
- I'm not gonna leave you here.

1308
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:35,893
- I'm trusting you.

1309
01:23:38,191 --> 01:23:40,213
I need you to trust me, okay?

1310
01:23:44,908 --> 01:23:45,908
Go.

1311
01:23:51,371 --> 01:23:52,431
Go.

1312
01:23:52,432 --> 01:23:55,181
(dramatic music)

1313
01:24:36,999 --> 01:24:37,999
- Shit.

1314
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:42,203
We need some money.

1315
01:24:44,090 --> 01:24:46,040
How much you get from those sick fucks?

1316
01:24:53,430 --> 01:24:54,830
- These are worth something.

1317
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:07,160
- You gotta be fucking kidding me.

1318
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:09,240
- What?

1319
01:25:10,310 --> 01:25:11,310
- They're fake.

1320
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:13,320
- No they're not.

1321
01:25:13,976 --> 01:25:15,070
She wouldn't do that to me.

1322
01:25:15,071 --> 01:25:16,939
She said I was her favorite.

1323
01:25:16,940 --> 01:25:19,040
- If you fog up a diamond with your breath

1324
01:25:20,030 --> 01:25:22,289
the fog evaporates off that
spot if the diamond's real

1325
01:25:22,290 --> 01:25:23,290
and if not,

1326
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:27,520
they stay cloudy and these
are fucking cloudy as fuck.

1327
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:29,633
You got scammed.

1328
01:25:32,490 --> 01:25:33,590
Where's all the money?

1329
01:25:39,788 --> 01:25:43,467
I'm not about to let them fuck
you out of what they owe you.

1330
01:25:43,492 --> 01:25:44,641
- Doesn't matter.

1331
01:25:44,666 --> 01:25:45,693
Forget about it.

1332
01:25:45,694 --> 01:25:47,209
- Yeah it does fucking matter.

1333
01:25:47,210 --> 01:25:48,603
- I'm serious.

1334
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:52,100
Forget it.

1335
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:55,743
- You fucking kidding me?

1336
01:25:55,744 --> 01:25:56,744
Let's go.

1337
01:25:57,519 --> 01:25:59,043
Let's go, get your fucking bag.

1338
01:26:00,035 --> 01:26:03,118
(ominous beat music)

1339
01:26:12,127 --> 01:26:14,361
- What are you looking for,
there's no money in there.

1340
01:26:14,362 --> 01:26:15,362
I told you.

1341
01:26:17,402 --> 01:26:18,402
Hey.

1342
01:26:20,812 --> 01:26:22,212
What the hell are you doing?

1343
01:26:24,048 --> 01:26:26,669
(sighing)

1344
01:26:26,740 --> 01:26:28,679
- You think I'm gonna
let them do this to you

1345
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:29,730
and get away with it?

1346
01:26:31,795 --> 01:26:32,795
- I'm worried.

1347
01:26:33,698 --> 01:26:34,698
- Don't be.

1348
01:26:37,210 --> 01:26:39,393
Just stay in the car
and I'll be right back.

1349
01:26:39,394 --> 01:26:40,394
You got it?

1350
01:26:42,587 --> 01:26:43,914
Yeah?

1351
01:26:43,915 --> 01:26:46,021
Okay, come here.

1352
01:26:46,022 --> 01:26:48,844
No one fucks with my girl, okay?

1353
01:26:48,845 --> 01:26:49,845
- Okay.

1354
01:26:51,718 --> 01:26:54,801
(ominous beat music)

1355
01:27:06,871 --> 01:27:07,871
Fuck.

1356
01:27:08,902 --> 01:27:12,069
(dramatic beat music)

1357
01:27:42,431 --> 01:27:44,681
(knocking)

1358
01:27:54,282 --> 01:27:56,325
- Shara is not here.

1359
01:27:56,326 --> 01:27:58,993
Do you want to see someone else?

1360
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:03,320
- Where's the money?

1361
01:28:05,585 --> 01:28:07,499
Don't fuck with me, lady.

1362
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:09,155
Now you fucked with my girl.

1363
01:28:09,180 --> 01:28:11,315
Not only do I want her
money, I want all the money.

1364
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:12,390
Do you understand me?

1365
01:28:13,886 --> 01:28:15,719
Do you understand me?!

1366
01:28:17,194 --> 01:28:18,238
- Yeah.

1367
01:28:18,239 --> 01:28:19,239
- Then move.

1368
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:23,520
You too, let's go.

1369
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:30,269
- Beauty, are you still here?

1370
01:28:30,270 --> 01:28:32,069
- Sit the fuck down!

1371
01:28:32,070 --> 01:28:34,820
(dramatic music)

1372
01:28:38,490 --> 01:28:39,843
Where's the fucking money?

1373
01:28:50,114 --> 01:28:52,859
(gunshot booming)

1374
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:55,610
(dramatic music)

1375
01:29:08,248 --> 01:29:11,331
(heartbeat thumping)

1376
01:29:20,837 --> 01:29:23,170
(screaming)

1377
01:29:25,702 --> 01:29:27,785
(crying)

1378
01:29:40,092 --> 01:29:42,259
(sobbing)

1379
01:29:43,988 --> 01:29:46,738
(dramatic music)

1380
01:30:39,864 --> 01:30:42,614
(dramatic music)

1381
01:31:13,031 --> 01:31:15,281
(knocking)

1382
01:31:17,604 --> 01:31:18,604
- Hey!

1383
01:31:23,210 --> 01:31:26,070
(screaming)

1384
01:31:26,071 --> 01:31:29,429
(dramatic music)

1385
01:31:29,430 --> 01:31:31,763
(screaming)

1386
01:31:41,747 --> 01:31:43,262
- [Shara] Have you ever thought about

1387
01:31:43,287 --> 01:31:45,203
walking into the ocean?

1388
01:31:45,790 --> 01:31:49,480
Like, you start at the
shore and keep walking,

1389
01:31:49,481 --> 01:31:52,622
until the water covers up your head.

1390
01:31:52,623 --> 01:31:54,577
And you just keep going

1391
01:31:56,633 --> 01:31:57,966
until you can't.

1392
01:31:59,378 --> 01:32:02,128
(waves rumbling)

1393
01:32:06,147 --> 01:32:08,897
(dramatic music)

1394
01:33:06,891 --> 01:33:09,641
(dramatic music)

1395
01:34:07,606 --> 01:34:10,356
(dramatic music)

1396
01:35:04,338 --> 01:35:07,171
(dramatic music)
