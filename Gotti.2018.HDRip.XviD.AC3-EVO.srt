1
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,612
Let me tell you something?

2
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:57,658
New York is the greatest fucking
city in the world. My city.

3
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,705
I was a kid in these streets,

4
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:03,164
I started in a fucking gutter
and made it to the top.

5
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,758
This life ends one of two ways

6
00:01:05,782 --> 00:01:09,527
dead or in jail. I did both.

7
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:27,915
I made my bones doing a piece
of work for Don Carlo Gambino.

8
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:31,585
I don't need to tell you
what happened. You know.

9
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,838
But the Commission is moving.

10
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:38,634
The families will not allow
this type of crime to go unchecked.

11
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,961
I mean Carlo,
he paid the kidnappers

12
00:02:40,985 --> 00:02:44,265
he complied with every demand.
And how did they respond?

13
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,908
By leaving the kid
in a fucking dumpster.

14
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:51,591
Now, each of the families
is organizing a team

15
00:02:51,615 --> 00:02:53,899
to head the hunt for the kidnappers.

16
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:57,115
But as far as I'm concerned,
this is the Gambino matter.

17
00:02:57,139 --> 00:03:00,489
And we will not fucking stand down,
this is our responsibility.

18
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:05,077
So John, I want you to
head the Gambino team.

19
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:09,248
We are not only doing this for Carlo,
we're doing this for the whole family.

20
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,525
I understand.

21
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:14,360
I want you to take
care of this for me.

22
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,789
It would be an honor.

23
00:03:17,813 --> 00:03:19,616
Consider it done.

24
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:36,776
Oh Jesus Christ.
Look at these fucking bums.

25
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,553
- Missy, hit me again, will ya?
- Whiskey nib, coming right up.

26
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:07,038
James McBratney?
You're under arrest.

27
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:15,755
I guess somebody better
call the cops now huh?

28
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,059
Let's go.

29
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:33,262
Come on, don't fuck up! Hey!

30
00:04:33,286 --> 00:04:35,334
Down, not a word.

31
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,920
After I had a successful
hit on my belt

32
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:42,425
Carlo Gambino opened up the books
for the first time since 1957.

33
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,451
And like that I became the made man.

34
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,565
Can you believe the way
they bring me in here?

35
00:05:15,589 --> 00:05:18,586
Like I'm Hannibal the fucking
cannibal or something.

36
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:22,965
I got the trifecta. I got
jaw, neck and throat.

37
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:27,386
They took my tit and put it on my face.
I do one-armed push-ups.

38
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,423
Cause the took the whole chest muscle out.

39
00:05:29,447 --> 00:05:30,992
Fucking butchers.

40
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:35,312
My body betray me John,
but not my mind.

41
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:38,356
And not my heart.
That will never happen.

42
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:43,760
I'm still here, John. I'm still
motherfucking these guys at every turn.

43
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,533
So,

44
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:51,118
what's up?

45
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:55,182
You ordered me a visit. I thought at
least I would make me get a phone call,

46
00:05:55,206 --> 00:05:57,006
but the judge insisted
I get the visit.

47
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:01,295
John, they didn't do it inside
the kindness of the heart.

48
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:05,239
So, I'm gonna ask you again. What's up?

49
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:15,166
I am thinking about taking a plea.

50
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:20,380
A plea?

51
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:27,405
And are their expectations
of you and this plea?

52
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:33,703
- Five and a half to seven years.
- Five and a half or seven, which is it?

53
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,373
Look, I don't want you should stay in
prison one motherfucking more day.

54
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,835
I'd rather have this cancer
that you'd have a cold.

55
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,239
But I'm telling you if I robbed a church,

56
00:06:43,263 --> 00:06:44,800
and I had the stipple sticking

57
00:06:44,824 --> 00:06:46,549
out of my ass, I would deny it.

58
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:47,758
I know, daddy.

59
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:53,079
OK, so I'm telling you as a father,
not as a boss, but as a father

60
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:57,018
if you say you're
innocent, I believe you.

61
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:59,783
So why would you stand up in
front of these motherfuckers

62
00:06:59,807 --> 00:07:02,064
and say that you guilty.
Why would you do that?

63
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,453
Because if I take this plea, it's over.

64
00:07:04,477 --> 00:07:07,737
They are not gonna keep coming after me,
or more charges.

65
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:12,700
- I'll get closure.
- Closure?

66
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:15,765
Let me make sure, I heard that straight?
Closure?

67
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:18,414
What kind of a
milli-mouthed word is that?

68
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,709
This is a word for

69
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:25,142
over educated,
under intelligent motherfuckers.

70
00:07:26,048 --> 00:07:28,174
This is not a word
that's in my vocabulary.

71
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,391
My boys are still young kids, dad.

72
00:07:30,415 --> 00:07:34,388
If I take this plea, I'm back with
them before they are teenagers.

73
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,961
If I lose at trial, I'm doing 20 years.

74
00:07:36,985 --> 00:07:38,809
Like they never had a father.

75
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,089
She's a nice woman.

76
00:07:40,113 --> 00:07:43,356
She's a nice woman now,
cause she's dying in cancer.

77
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,072
Two weeks ago, everybody hated her.

78
00:07:46,096 --> 00:07:49,320
Now she is Miss Popularity.
I'm just saying.

79
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:51,624
- When is Halloween?
- Next week.

80
00:07:51,648 --> 00:07:53,732
Next week, this week, what do I know?

81
00:07:53,756 --> 00:07:56,952
Everyday is Halloween in this place.
What are you going to be?

82
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:01,791
Officer Mike down the block is gonna lend
me his police dress. I'm going as a cop.

83
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,014
What's the matter with you?

84
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:04,862
- What me?
- What are doing with my son?

85
00:08:04,886 --> 00:08:08,248
Oh now, it's your son alone.
Cause of you, I'm a lonely.

86
00:08:08,272 --> 00:08:09,328
Let me tell you something.

87
00:08:09,352 --> 00:08:11,340
No kid of mine is going to
be a cop for Halloween,

88
00:08:11,364 --> 00:08:13,582
and that's it.
That's not gonna happen.

89
00:08:13,606 --> 00:08:16,806
He's just a kid, today he wants to
be a cop, tomorrow an astronaut.

90
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,429
If I ever hear that you let
my son or any of my kids,

91
00:08:19,453 --> 00:08:22,770
and you for that matter,
talk to that cop or any cop, I'll kill you.

92
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:27,525
- Relax. He's just being nice to your son.
- Don't make me repeat myself Victoria.

93
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:31,397
And you, you don't dress like a cop.
You don't act like a cop.

94
00:08:31,421 --> 00:08:33,304
You don't talk like a
cop, you understand me?

95
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:39,042
- What's the matter with you?
- Me? What's the matter with you?

96
00:08:39,066 --> 00:08:41,391
Don't star Victoria OK?
I'm not in the mood.

97
00:08:41,415 --> 00:08:43,012
Don't talk to me like that.

98
00:08:43,036 --> 00:08:46,285
You think you're such a tough guy. Do you
know, what you're doing to this family?

99
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:48,608
You are gonna kill me?
I'd like to see you try.

100
00:08:48,632 --> 00:08:51,476
Don't get smart with me. Now...
look, what you wanna be?

101
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,176
Would you ask him, what he wants
to be instead? What do you wanna be?

102
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,718
A baseball player?

103
00:08:55,742 --> 00:08:57,179
No, no, you don't wanna
be a baseball payer.

104
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:00,978
Why don't you be Casper the ghost?
You put a sheet over.

105
00:09:01,002 --> 00:09:02,435
"Casper is for five years old."

106
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,333
What was you?
Who was you last year? You were a

107
00:09:04,357 --> 00:09:06,674
princess last year. Right?
And what was you... You was...

108
00:09:06,698 --> 00:09:08,110
Time is out, Gotti.

109
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,342
Ah! Gotta go.

110
00:09:10,366 --> 00:09:13,487
- I love you.
- Love you too!

111
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:18,200
After being IDed by the barman,
they sent me to Green Haven Penitentiary

112
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:21,728
where I served 2 years
of the 4 years sentence.

113
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,471
With the guards on my back pocket,

114
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:50,840
I was able to get medical payroll
to see the family dentist.

115
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:05,813
Not a cavity inside, Mr. Gotti.
We'll see you next time.

116
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:23,122
And while I was at it, I was able to clean
up some unfinished McBratney business.

117
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:33,010
Remember what I used
to tell you as guys

118
00:11:33,034 --> 00:11:34,754
it was me, Angelo and Frankie.

119
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:38,266
We said we was going out of town,
and we'd have a construction job

120
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:41,510
we was gonna build this big wall,
that was gonna take 2 years.

121
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,787
Do you remember?

122
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:50,186
John, I want what's best
for you and your family.

123
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:54,482
Then the idea, just one day you'll
be in a prison, made me sick.

124
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:57,990
But I don't know what makes me sicker,
you being in prison

125
00:11:58,014 --> 00:11:59,551
or you bowing to these
pieces of shit.

126
00:11:59,575 --> 00:12:00,279
What bowing?

127
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,149
There is no bowing.
It's a compromise.

128
00:12:02,173 --> 00:12:04,575
They get their pint of flush,
I get my peace of mind.

129
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,370
The peace of mind that one day,

130
00:12:06,394 --> 00:12:09,789
I'll be there for my family when I need it.
That's what this is.

131
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:12,039
How can you be so naive?
Once they get

132
00:12:12,063 --> 00:12:15,294
you laid, you will never be free again.
Do you understand?

133
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,293
They say you win this time,
but next time, they'll

134
00:12:17,317 --> 00:12:19,382
- make sure that you don't.
- There won't be a next time.

135
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:22,132
I have always felt in my
heart that the day would come

136
00:12:22,156 --> 00:12:24,470
when my family and I
get separated by prison.

137
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:29,225
I am just thankful that it isn't for life.
And this plea will ensure that.

138
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:33,938
I had high hopes for Johnny boy. Me, I
was born with 4 fucking sis to my name.

139
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:36,732
Now I got a kid, going to the
New York military academy.

140
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:42,613
Johnny boy. Come on.
Let's go, we ain't got all day.

141
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:44,615
What's the matter? You
guys look like your

142
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,742
brother's going to electric chair.
Cheer up.

143
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:50,121
Why don't you go get some ice cream?
Pizzas!

144
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:53,280
- I don't like ice cream.
- You love fuzz sticks, get that.

145
00:12:53,304 --> 00:12:54,514
I do not like pizza either.

146
00:12:54,538 --> 00:12:56,949
How about the movies,
what's that movie you like

147
00:12:56,973 --> 00:12:59,527
so much?
About spaghetti, meatballs or something.

148
00:12:59,551 --> 00:13:00,297
Go see that.

149
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:03,534
Come on, we ain't got whole day.

150
00:13:03,558 --> 00:13:06,727
Alright, guys, come here.

151
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,012
Alright, you guys better not get
into any trouble while I'm gone.

152
00:13:11,036 --> 00:13:12,643
Look out for your
brother, alright?

153
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,237
Alright, enough, enough!
Let's go.

154
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:18,274
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Ma! Ma! I gotta go!

155
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,613
Hey

156
00:13:19,637 --> 00:13:20,820
Please I gotta go.

157
00:13:20,844 --> 00:13:23,654
I made you a Tunasandwich,
for the road.

158
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:27,307
You know what? You're gonna
see him this weekend.

159
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:38,162
At my house, more often or
not, was Angelo Ruggiero.

160
00:13:38,186 --> 00:13:40,421
My best friend
since we was kids.

161
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:41,562
Hey, Ang.

162
00:13:41,586 --> 00:13:44,967
Hey. He up yet? You talk
to him, I have tried.

163
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,183
Hey, uncle Ang.

164
00:13:46,207 --> 00:13:48,959
Hey! Whoa! You know
what's good for you?

165
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,063
You don't let your
dad see the cop car.

166
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:54,125
Come on, you fucking prick.

167
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,961
Look at this. Come on.

168
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:58,754
Oh, motherfucker!

169
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:00,483
You know what fucking time it is?

170
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,109
Did you see that?
Did you see that?

171
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:04,153
I got 6 tons of Buffalo,
they killing us. 10 to nothing.

172
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:07,388
I put 6 dimes on the winger,
they killing us.

173
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,515
I put 6 dimes on the
Chicago, they are losing.

174
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,655
And now I put 3 dimes on
Kansas city, they are

175
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:14,247
winning. But they'll fucking
blow it, motherfucker!

176
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,742
Maybe you should hang yourself,
leave all your troubles behind.

177
00:14:16,766 --> 00:14:19,001
Smart ass. Listen, you wouldn't believe
how much I lost last week.

178
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,420
- I don't wanna believe. Don't wanna know.
- Just once...

179
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:24,738
I would give my fucking life, just to have
The Redskins win once.

180
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,669
I got a Redskin named Willi boy in the car.

181
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:30,078
I gotta clean up. Motherfuckers!

182
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:34,123
- Uncle Angelo, look.
- What do you got there Frankie?

183
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,001
Oh! No you didn't?
You straight A's?

184
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:39,546
You straight A's? I never
seen anything like this.

185
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:42,465
Hey Frankie boy, did you show
Uncle Angelo your report card?

186
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:44,652
Can you believe that? My
son is a goddamn genius.

187
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:47,655
My Frank is gonna be a rocket scientist.
What do you think about that Ang?

188
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,015
Let's go. I won't be home for dinner.

189
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:50,700
What are you talking about?
It is Sunday night...

190
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,994
What? I gotta repeat myself? I'm
not coming home for dinner.

191
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:55,603
- Johnny it's family night?
- I'll make it up to this.

192
00:14:56,438 --> 00:15:00,316
Manhattan's Garment District has
long been the central to the

193
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:02,047
Mafia portfolio of lucrative rackets,

194
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:05,404
and a hugely profitable adjunct
to the mob's historic stranglehold

195
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,824
on trucking and laboring unions.

196
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:11,911
Authorities believe that, this
man, John Gotti, a feared captain

197
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:14,223
in the Gambino family
is the mobster primarily in control of the

198
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:18,834
extortion, corruption
and robbery

199
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,754
with in the multi-million dollar New York
fashion industry.

200
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,139
Gotti, is perceived as
the up incomer in the

201
00:15:24,163 --> 00:15:26,694
Mafia, organized crime
family considered...

202
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:29,678
Johnny boy was tough.
He knew how to handle himself.

203
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,986
I told him to tell
anybody who had a balls

204
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,410
to ask what his father
did for a living,

205
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,564
that I was a 24 hours 7
days a week street guy.

206
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,646
Who the fucking god think he is?

207
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:41,273
He is Greek. He doesn't
have his head screwed up.

208
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,233
He has got off the boat yesterday.

209
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:46,320
Who gave him permission to
run pock in Howard Beach?

210
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:49,156
- I told him.
- What did you tell him?

211
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,575
How the fuck does he have
a phone talking about me?

212
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:52,869
My name!

213
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:57,165
He says he's with the Greek Mafia, the
smoke is so full of shit, it ain't funny.

214
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:58,791
Miss Luzio, hold up, hold up.

215
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:02,002
Lou... Louie... Go help her.

216
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:03,147
I'll take care of it.

217
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:05,882
Take that shit off your face.
He looks like a hippie.

218
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,300
Why don't you grab 50 % of this?

219
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,469
Look, I want this shut
down yesterday.

220
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:14,140
This guy is a nobody, even if he
was a somebody, I don't give a fuck!

221
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,267
- You understood me?
- Okay.

222
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:20,164
Mr. Gotti.

223
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:22,565
- How are you?
- You still working out?

224
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:25,252
- Not that much any more.
- Come on, what's the matter?

225
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:28,279
- He was a quite hope.
- They just fucking closed on Tully's.

226
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,050
Tully's an institution? How
long Tully's been around?

227
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:33,659
I have been walking by
Tully's for 40 years.

228
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,971
- What happened? What the fuck happened?
- I don't know.

229
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,123
The rent's gone up, they got sited for
some code violation or something.

230
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:42,377
Don't you worry. It will
be back in business.

231
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:44,671
How's your father?
How is his liver?

232
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,924
He is still here.
He is still here.

233
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:50,760
You tell him hello
from me, alright?

234
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:53,596
Mr. Gotti. Thank you.

235
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,516
I don't give a fuck who it is.

236
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,351
He is using my name on the phone.

237
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:03,689
So you tell this cocksucker, that if
he ever deals another card in Queens,

238
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,983
or ever he whispers my name again,

239
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:07,818
I, me, John Gotti,

240
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:10,279
will sever his motherfucking head off.

241
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,119
- Put on the ice.
- Ma, I'm good. Ma!

242
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:18,329
OK.
I will fix you something to eat.

243
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,584
Get your feet off the couch.

244
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:25,253
Get up.

245
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,468
You got suspended, huh?

246
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,613
What do you think you're doing?

247
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:38,047
These local kids jumped a couple of our
guys. We was just handling our business.

248
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:40,268
You were handling your business?

249
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:43,312
- I guess.
- You guess?

250
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:45,939
You show up?

251
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,984
Yeah. I would say so.

252
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,154
Attaboy.

253
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:55,032
You stood your ground.
You didn't back off.

254
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:58,076
You never back off.
You always stand up. You fight,

255
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,787
till you can't fight no more,

256
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:02,289
never take backward step ever.

257
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,418
Dad, I'm thinking maybe I don't wanna
try for West Point anymore.

258
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:08,963
- Maybe, I could take a year off.
- Take a year off?

259
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:11,299
Drop by to school, not
go to college,

260
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:12,926
become a bum on the street...

261
00:18:12,927 --> 00:18:14,069
which one?

262
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,224
What are you thinking?

263
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,187
You wanna hang out with me?

264
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:26,855
Is that what you're thinking?

265
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,483
Jesus Christ...

266
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,322
Booch, I'm hungry!

267
00:18:41,738 --> 00:18:45,283
They get it, if they are good.

268
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,628
Well, they get what they get paid.
A lot of them are bummers.

269
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,379
That's for sure.

270
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:56,427
The Lucchese is here.

271
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,931
I don't like that guy.

272
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:02,308
Which one?

273
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:05,019
His name is Gas pipe.

274
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,770
Yeah, I heard him.

275
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,063
He is trouble.

276
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:11,984
He is up in Angelo's face
at the apartment of the 59th street.

277
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,902
He is real sick of him.

278
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:17,072
Look at him, this is making sure

279
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,199
all families know his name.

280
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,659
Prick.

281
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,829
Relax. He is not our business.

282
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,920
Sweetheart,
could we get another round here please?

283
00:19:25,944 --> 00:19:26,986
You got it.

284
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:30,502
Let me ask you something.
What do you think the Genovese

285
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,629
think of their boss?

286
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,339
What are you talking about?

287
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,134
I can understand the
whole insanity pleading.

288
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:39,045
Come on, running around
town in a fucking

289
00:19:39,069 --> 00:19:40,954
pajamas, give me a
fucking break...

290
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:44,433
Vincent THE CHIN Gigante,
according to the government,

291
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:47,311
the powerful boss of the
Genovese crime family.

292
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:49,104
To me, he was a rival.

293
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:51,356
Chin is a very smart guy.

294
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:55,153
He runs his family as he sees fit.
I can tell you this,

295
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,158
you'll never see Chin
and his girl in a

296
00:19:57,182 --> 00:19:59,049
place like this. That's
for fucking sure.

297
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:02,474
Well, talking about bosses who hide.

298
00:20:02,498 --> 00:20:03,994
- Don't start.
- Just telling...

299
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:05,829
He is never here.

300
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:09,500
How can you run a family
if you're not on the ground with them?

301
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:13,129
Johnny. You got to shut the fuck up.
Paul is your boss.

302
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:15,214
End of fucking story.

303
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:19,760
Who is that guy with Frankie?

304
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:21,386
What's his name again?

305
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,096
It's Sammy Bull.

306
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,932
That's Sammy. Why Bull?

307
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:28,603
- The bulls hit dead man.
- I know about him.

308
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:30,164
You don't like anybody here tonight.

309
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:32,050
I just don't like what
I hear about him.

310
00:20:32,074 --> 00:20:33,500
OK? That's all I'm saying.

311
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:35,817
He is a good earner.
And he's Frankie's guy.

312
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,004
He never done time.

313
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:40,072
I don't trust anybody, who never done time.

314
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,823
He's our friend now.

315
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:44,201
Hey listen, you trust
Frankie, don't you?

316
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:47,387
Frankie would vouch to the fucking oomph
for this kid. We gotta give him a chance.

317
00:20:47,388 --> 00:20:48,072
Here they come.

318
00:20:48,096 --> 00:20:49,332
Hey boys.

319
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,084
How you doing tonight?
Hey, Johnny.

320
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,187
How you doing, Neil?

321
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:54,461
How are you, Sammy?

322
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:55,838
Hey, Frank.

323
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,150
Sammy, I would like to meet,

324
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:00,384
a good friend of ours and
a dear friend of mine,

325
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:01,761
John Gotti.

326
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:05,640
How you doing John?
Heard a lot about you from Frankie.

327
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:07,201
Good to finally meet.

328
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:08,827
- Well, good, I hope.
- Of course it's good.

329
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,162
I'm gonna talk about my brother.

330
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:12,396
Let me tell you something.
Time with Lewisburg

331
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,815
will make a man out of you.
OK. Am I right Frankie?

332
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,610
You come out of the Tick N the Tips.

333
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:20,196
Brother Johnny.

334
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:23,031
Let's raise a glass
to our new friend.

335
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:24,825
- Salud.
- Salud.

336
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:26,702
Neil...

337
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:28,120
Frankie...

338
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:35,127
You trust this kid?

339
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:41,509
Thank you.

340
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:48,140
We walked together and
we fall together.

341
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:49,809
This is the life.

342
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:52,769
I chose my side over
40 years ago.

343
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,266
The hardest thing in
this world for me to do

344
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:55,845
would be to have to say
goodbye be to my kids.

345
00:21:55,869 --> 00:21:57,385
- I can't do it.
- I don't want you to,

346
00:21:57,409 --> 00:21:59,420
I don't want you have
to lie to your kids.

347
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:01,755
And you tell them you are out
on some construction job.

348
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:04,240
You and me, job, we never
had to lie to each other.

349
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,616
But it's the lies that
you tell yourself,

350
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:08,494
these are the lies you gotta live with.

351
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:13,874
You are missing your kids?
You think that's bad?

352
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,918
Do I really have to say it?

353
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:17,962
Do I?

354
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:24,844
Frankie...

355
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:27,971
No, leave the light on.

356
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:31,225
- Frankie, we are just down.
- Oh, leave the light on. Kids

357
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:32,768
are scared of the dark.

358
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:35,146
- This till John gets back?
- Till John gets back.

359
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:39,399
Good night, Frankie. Love you.

360
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,319
- See you tomorrow.
- I love you.

361
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:59,802
Oh God, no, Frankie, Frankie.

362
00:23:59,814 --> 00:24:02,483
- I did not see him.
- Frankie.

363
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:05,877
Mommy is here.
Oh, Frankie. Mommy's here.

364
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,533
The sun has blinded.

365
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:12,785
Mommy's here. Stay wake.

366
00:25:45,253 --> 00:25:48,130
Johnny boy, it was an accident.

367
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:50,841
It was an accident. It happened.

368
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:52,551
He is gone.

369
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,262
But he will always
be your brother.

370
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:56,554
Now, you listen to me.

371
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,848
I want you to be strong, okay?

372
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:00,558
I'm proud of you.

373
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,186
We gotta do this for your mother.
Go ahead.

374
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:04,939
Come on.

375
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:11,320
Come here.

376
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:12,863
Come here.

377
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,323
Come here.

378
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:17,076
Come here.

379
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:27,723
Come on, I'm late.
What the hell are you waiting for?

380
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,656
- What are you doing?
- Frankie is cold.

381
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,577
- He needs a blanket. No!
- Come here.

382
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:43,662
Come here.

383
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:47,041
It will be fine. Come here.

384
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:49,043
It will be fine.

385
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,255
Calm down, Vicky. Calm down.

386
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:57,301
I need to go. I must.

387
00:27:58,094 --> 00:28:00,387
Listen to me, listen to me.

388
00:28:00,388 --> 00:28:02,222
I need to go.

389
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:04,599
I have to bring him a blanket.

390
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,310
He is cold!

391
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:25,787
What happened? Is Vicky OK?

392
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:27,497
This piece of shit Favara.

393
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:29,708
She smacked him around with a baseball bat.

394
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:31,292
She's gonna be alright.

395
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:33,044
He's a stupid fucking asshole, John!

396
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,088
He never fixed the dent in a car!

397
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:38,676
He leaves it there even in the driveway,
day after day for Vicky to see.

398
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,720
John, we can't know why

399
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:43,513
God lets these things happen,

400
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:46,016
but there has to be a reason.

401
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:47,559
A reason?

402
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,269
For these things?

403
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,689
He was 12 years old. He didn't
have a hair in his prink.

404
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:55,567
There ain't no fucking reason.
There ain't no fucking God.

405
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:57,903
Don't say another word.

406
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:06,495
I'mma take Vicky down to
Florida to see her family.

407
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:09,080
I think, it will be good for us.

408
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,666
Clear our heads.

409
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:25,930
On March 12, 1980,

410
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:29,017
12 year old Frank Gotti was riding
his mini bike on this street,

411
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:32,187
157th Avenue,
just 3 blocks from his home,

412
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:36,232
John Favara's car hit 12 year
old Frank Gotti and killed him.

413
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:40,403
The people who know the Gotti they never
came to terms with young Frank's death.

414
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:41,840
Police however believed someone,

415
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:44,157
did come to terms with John Favara.

416
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:47,577
On July 28th, Favara left his job and

417
00:29:47,578 --> 00:29:50,348
walked to his car which was parked
next door at the Capitol Diner.

418
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:52,957
The Diner's owner told Police he saw 3 men

419
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,210
clubbed Favara and
shoved him into a van.

420
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:58,254
The best witness Police had
in the abduction of John Favara

421
00:29:58,255 --> 00:30:00,757
was Leon Papon, the man who
owned the diner,

422
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:04,178
he had seen the whole thing,
he told that to Nassau County police.

423
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:07,555
But then the assailants returned
to the diner, several days later.

424
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:09,432
They reportedly ordered coffee

425
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:12,101
and as they Sept it,
they stared at Papon.

426
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:16,482
Right after that, Papon stopped
cooperating with Nassau County Detectives.

427
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:18,650
His memory of the incident faded.

428
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:21,320
He sold the
diner and moved away.

429
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,704
OK, that's it. That's it.

430
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,497
That's it.

431
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:33,749
That's it.

432
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,418
Vicky...

433
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:37,979
Enough.

434
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:40,463
I love you, but we
got four other kids.

435
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:43,716
We'll never let go of Frankie,
do you understand me? Never.

436
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:45,761
He is in our hearts forever.

437
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:48,680
For ever. Till the day we die.

438
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:51,391
We are gonna always live like
we are seven.

439
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,229
I'm gonna make you some coffee.

440
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:09,952
Alright.

441
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:11,912
No problem. Merry Christmas.

442
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:18,283
Look at him. That
lousy bastard father

443
00:31:18,307 --> 00:31:21,231
turns out to be a good grandpa.

444
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:23,298
- Who knew?
- You never know...

445
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:26,342
Tell you something,
maybe if we didn't have such crappy parents

446
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:28,970
we would have so much in common.
You understand?

447
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:32,557
Yeah. I would be living in Flat bush
married to a dentist.

448
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:35,518
What are you talking about?
You get a bad tooth

449
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,188
I will happy to knock that
right out of your mouth.

450
00:31:39,607 --> 00:31:41,984
There is my smile, there is my girl.

451
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:46,145
You didn't think you'd be used to having
hundred people around this house, huh?

452
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:49,074
Yeah. One night a
year, I can handle it.

453
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:51,284
Can you believe it?

454
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:54,287
We used to barely have
enough for the two of us.

455
00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:56,789
But we had each other.
That's what it matters.

456
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,666
That's all it matters.

457
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:01,377
You and me, we get through this together.

458
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:03,213
We get through anything.

459
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:08,677
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

460
00:32:09,887 --> 00:32:13,307
Let me ask you, who is that
guy sitting in my chair?

461
00:32:14,183 --> 00:32:15,511
You've been meaning to ask?

462
00:32:15,535 --> 00:32:17,996
That guy has been in your chair every
Christmas for the last 15 years.

463
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,521
For 15 years.

464
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:25,276
Let me get you a drink.

465
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:27,779
- How about a cigar?
- Let's do it.

466
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,113
Sammy Gravano told me

467
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,133
something.

468
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:31,741
What did Sammy Gravano say?

469
00:32:31,742 --> 00:32:33,264
You was over at
Paul's house just now.

470
00:32:33,288 --> 00:32:35,576
Yeah, I was at
Paul's house just now.

471
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:39,666
- Did you see Sammy there?
- No. I just stopped by for 2 minutes.

472
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:43,837
He tells Paul, he says I wanna go see
Neil, wish him a merry Christmas.

473
00:32:44,922 --> 00:32:47,465
- Why do I give a shit about all this?
- Paul said:

474
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:49,361
What the hell you wanna do that for?
You are on our side.

475
00:32:49,385 --> 00:32:50,945
And what did Sammy say to that?

476
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,388
He said "We are all a family, ain't we?"

477
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:58,059
Sammy told you that?

478
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,561
Sammy told me.

479
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:20,791
You need a woman.

480
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:42,061
- Now I know.
- I can not believe.

481
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:43,563
Paul...

482
00:33:43,564 --> 00:33:46,149
Paul Castellano was a
fucking fish in the desert.

483
00:33:46,275 --> 00:33:47,984
A fish out of the water.

484
00:33:47,985 --> 00:33:49,944
I never respected Paul.

485
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:52,155
Neil was much more of a boss

486
00:33:52,156 --> 00:33:53,698
that Paul ever was.

487
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:56,826
- Give my regards to Victoria.
- I will, thanks.

488
00:33:56,827 --> 00:33:58,662
She will be glad to hear it.

489
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:19,620
I'm just saying, if Paul goes
to prison for them indictments

490
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:21,745
they're gonna make Tommy
Bilorti the street boss.

491
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:24,730
Happy days! We're gonna have
hold it to wig business.

492
00:34:25,022 --> 00:34:27,356
Neil, what's going on here?

493
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:29,317
Keeping Paul

494
00:34:29,318 --> 00:34:31,379
He's not concerned making the deal with
those other families than his own.

495
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:33,404
He's the boss. End
of fucking story.

496
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:36,073
Time Magazine says,
you, the boss.

497
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,644
Shows you what a disreputable
fucking profession that is.

498
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:41,537
- You know why.
- I tell you why.

499
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:44,290
Because we have never been under
this kind of scrutiny before.

500
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:46,209
They can see you, Neil.

501
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:48,252
- Yeah. Too fucking much.
- No, no, no!

502
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:51,923
You could see, he could talk man to
man with you. Know what I'm saying?

503
00:34:51,924 --> 00:34:54,926
What's Paul's contribution to
society, fucking his

504
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:56,260
Portuguese maid?

505
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:58,471
As long as it keeps him off my back...

506
00:34:58,472 --> 00:35:02,642
Yeah but, 35 years, in the same house
as his wife. I mean, that ain't right.

507
00:35:05,229 --> 00:35:06,938
I guess you gotta give him credit.

508
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,649
For what? His penile implant?

509
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:11,651
You got his house bugged? Do you?

510
00:35:11,652 --> 00:35:14,714
Yeah, I defeated that 50 thousand dollar
security system with my good looks.

511
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:17,156
That Portuguese maid
was crazy about me.

512
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:20,409
She is Guatemalan.

513
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:23,431
So, you have seen it? What ever country
she is from they probably made her leave.

514
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,707
I would not fuck her with your dick.

515
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:29,252
Listen. Paul has got diabetes.

516
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:33,923
It's not a subject I feel
comfortable discussing.

517
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:35,876
What the fuck is so fucking funny?

518
00:35:35,999 --> 00:35:38,290
It's hysterical,
we're gonna get a fucking accident.

519
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:47,770
Oh, look at this place.
What a dump!

520
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,355
What are we doing here?

521
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:51,918
We get a couple of drinks get the fuck
outta here, go get something to eat.

522
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:55,695
Let's go to "Little Pete", it's got that
shrimp in there. I mean you like this.

523
00:35:55,696 --> 00:35:56,881
It's a cop zone.

524
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,550
It's fucking Garry and
his fucking shrimp...

525
00:35:58,574 --> 00:35:59,634
How about a little shot, it's on me.

526
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:02,136
- No, we are good. Thanks.
- What the fuck you guys are talking about?

527
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,744
I went there the other week.

528
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:05,371
It's not filled with cops.

529
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:07,982
Do me a favor, take a walk, you
and your fucking mustache.

530
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:10,001
Five cops, last week, heading...

531
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:13,130
- Three shots for me and my boys here.
- We're good, thank you.

532
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,720
Hey, you're too good to
have a shot with me?

533
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:18,468
I said take a fucking walk.

534
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:40,365
Stay down motherfucker!

535
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:45,537
- Connard!
- Fucker!

536
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:47,830
You motherfucking piece of shit!

537
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:49,291
Little shit!

538
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:54,379
John, come on! Come on!

539
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,798
Fuck!

540
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,226
I didn't give a fuck,
when he came in, I

541
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,202
grabbed the ball stool,
I grabbed 2 ball stools

542
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,662
I was going over, I don't give a fuck.
I just kept going.

543
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:12,165
Oh my God, I was swinging I didn't
know who the fuck I was hitting.

544
00:37:12,189 --> 00:37:13,700
You swinged at the wrong guy 3 times.

545
00:37:13,724 --> 00:37:15,001
- No I didn't.
- You kidding me?

546
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:17,944
You hit the wrong kid. He
wasn't even with them.

547
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:26,661
You little motherfucker!

548
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:29,414
Did you have a fight tonight?
Did you?

549
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:33,167
Someone got killed!
Did you know that? Did you?

550
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:36,045
- No I did not know that!
- You shut the fuck up.

551
00:37:36,046 --> 00:37:38,756
You cocksuckers! You
gonna ruin your future!

552
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,216
Don't you understand?

553
00:37:40,217 --> 00:37:43,261
It's gonna follow you for the
rest of your fucking... life!

554
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,436
- Someone got killed?
- Not when I was there.

555
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:56,899
Proudest moment of his life was watching
you graduate from military school.

556
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,860
And now this. You father is crushed.

557
00:37:59,069 --> 00:38:00,695
- You know that?
- I know.

558
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:03,114
- No! You do not know anything!
- Dad...

559
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:05,282
Now shut up. I will talk to you later.

560
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,742
The sharks are circling.

561
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:09,370
The cops are gonna shake him down.
And that man's gonna,

562
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:11,038
pay to protect you.

563
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:14,167
I didn't kill the guy!
I will answer for it, anything!

564
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:16,711
- We didn't kill anybody.
- I know that.

565
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:18,629
But it doesn't fucking matter.

566
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,840
You two stupid motherfuckers.

567
00:38:20,841 --> 00:38:24,344
You brought a lot of fucking hate down
on this family.

568
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:28,556
Actually, it was Angelo
who put the heat down on the family

569
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:31,642
when the government
released what would become known as

570
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:34,145
the "Angelo Ruggiero tapes".

571
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:36,355
They picked up Ang on a wire tap.

572
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:38,232
Taking about various activities that

573
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:41,652
neither Paul or the
government would've sanctioned.

574
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,195
Fucking Ang.

575
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:44,947
This is ridiculous!

576
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:46,323
You got popped Ang.

577
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,284
Let me just ask you one question.

578
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:50,911
Are you bad mouthing Paul on them tapes?
Are you?

579
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:53,099
- I don't know, there's hundreds of hours.
- Oh come on!

580
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:56,083
- What? You don't know nothing?
- They bugged my daughters'.

581
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:57,603
What were you saying on the tapes?

582
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:59,767
I said a lot of things
that could get a lot of

583
00:38:59,791 --> 00:39:02,048
people in a lot of
trouble. It's what I said.

584
00:39:02,049 --> 00:39:03,966
My friends are on those tapes.

585
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:05,403
Our friends are on those tapes.

586
00:39:05,427 --> 00:39:07,595
Neil... OK...

587
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:11,975
If Angelo decides that he's gonna turn
these tapes over to Paul? What happens?

588
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:13,517
- Is that it?
- No.

589
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:16,104
That is most definitely not fucking it.

590
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:20,107
If Paul wants the tapes,
we gotta get him the tapes.

591
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:23,528
He's the boss. Boss is the boss is
the boss, that's the Cosa Nostra.

592
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:26,489
Tell me I don't know
something about it, please!

593
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:28,991
If it was just some fucking asshole,

594
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:31,429
getting called out of some Joe,
he know I would authorize the

595
00:39:31,453 --> 00:39:33,621
handover in a second.

596
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:36,457
- But this is our friends.
- Look...

597
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:38,751
If the government has a case,

598
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:41,212
Paul will find out when it comes to trial,

599
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:44,224
because it will be matter of public record.
You are fucked either way.

600
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:46,092
We are fucked.

601
00:39:46,093 --> 00:39:48,928
OK. We are fucked either way.

602
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:01,691
No no, that's not gonna happen. Get
it out of your head right now.

603
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:08,489
Listen...

604
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:12,618
You know, Paul doesn't give
2 fucks about me or you,

605
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:14,537
He shit picks over his fucking case.

606
00:40:14,538 --> 00:40:15,932
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about?

607
00:40:15,956 --> 00:40:18,124
Ang, just shut the fuck up, will you?

608
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,251
You got us into this mess.

609
00:40:20,252 --> 00:40:23,463
- Please.
- Get the fuck out of here, Ang. Go on.

610
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,393
Christ almighty...

611
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,478
I ain't saying you're wrong.

612
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,606
But what do you want me to tell Paul?

613
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:45,943
Ang is saying to the boss, "Fuck you! I
don't wanna handover those fucking tapes!"

614
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:48,530
I've been trying to make
this thing go away, but...

615
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:50,949
Paul keeps bringing it up.

616
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:54,494
Unless I say it to him, Fuck you!
Go fuck yourself!

617
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:57,246
And then, you know,
we gotta do then...

618
00:40:57,247 --> 00:40:59,456
We roll a mother, we go to war.

619
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:03,461
That's right. We gotta do what we gotta do.
We strike him before he gets to us.

620
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:08,465
What?

621
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:10,759
- What's the matter, you OK?
- Yeah.. no.

622
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,638
- What do you need?
- It will pass.

623
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:16,390
It's funny.

624
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:19,560
All these fucking tapes
and trials...

625
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:21,312
We spend all these time trying

626
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:24,106
to stay one step
ahead of the game...

627
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:26,484
But this fucking cancer...

628
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:30,029
And it's the ultimate fuck you.

629
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:40,248
I'm really not painted.

630
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,216
You got something for me?

631
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:52,278
You see this kid here?

632
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:54,530
Used to give him 5 dollars,
he went to candy store.

633
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:57,557
Now look at him, he's a fucking earner.

634
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:01,060
Here.
Buy yourself a nice sports jacket.

635
00:42:01,061 --> 00:42:04,104
Because we are going to Binge tonight.

636
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:05,523
Tonight, tonight.

637
00:42:07,776 --> 00:42:09,786
I'mma tell you something
about your old man.

638
00:42:10,362 --> 00:42:13,031
When he was sent off to Green
Haven on the McBratney thing,

639
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:14,990
which you probably know about

640
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:17,452
Carlo Gambino was so
grateful to your father

641
00:42:17,494 --> 00:42:20,121
for his service to him...

642
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:24,416
He got him Roy
Cohn to defend him.

643
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:27,545
Roy Conh, the biggest fucking
lawyer in the country.

644
00:42:28,255 --> 00:42:30,965
Your dad wasn't even a
main man at that time.

645
00:42:31,091 --> 00:42:33,217
Cohn, he makes a deal into plea...

646
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:36,220
He gets it reduced to involuntary
manslaughter. And your dad's

647
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:37,365
out in four.

648
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:40,099
One of our people who know about this,

649
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,894
how your dad going to
arrested in the first place.

650
00:42:43,103 --> 00:42:45,562
Your dad was lying low,
in the wind,

651
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,933
he has to have this problem
with the Genovese family.

652
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:49,210
He showed up.

653
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:52,695
He receded up my behalf at a seat down
near here in Maspeth.

654
00:42:53,405 --> 00:42:56,616
And the FBI picket him up on
a tip-off as he was leaving.

655
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:00,244
Loyalty cuts both ways for them.

656
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:01,787
Your honor,

657
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:04,331
the prosecution contains that Mr. Gotti

658
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:06,583
is a clear and continuing
danger to the community.

659
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:09,172
And in lieu of potential
life sentence in this case

660
00:43:09,196 --> 00:43:11,463
it would be imprudent
to grant him bail.

661
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:12,566
Thank you, Miss Giacalone,

662
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,552
but you have not convinced me
that Mr Gotti is a flight risk.

663
00:43:16,136 --> 00:43:18,971
Court grants bail on the
amount of one million dollars.

664
00:43:18,972 --> 00:43:22,031
Your honor, as the court has
granted bail for Mr Gotti

665
00:43:22,055 --> 00:43:23,828
we also request that there be set

666
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:25,811
at a reasonable amount for Mr.
Johnson.

667
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:28,106
Your honor, we have strong
reasons to believe

668
00:43:28,148 --> 00:43:30,376
that the defendant's life
will be in serious jeopardy

669
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,361
- if he is granted bail.
- And why would that be?

670
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:48,918
Because Wilfred Johnson
has been a confidential informant

671
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,212
for the FBI for the past 19 years.

672
00:43:52,005 --> 00:43:54,298
- Order!
- Liar!

673
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:56,759
- She is lying! I'll fucking kill you!
- Order!

674
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:00,220
- You're going to kill me!
- You will have order.

675
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:02,390
Counsel, restrain your client.

676
00:44:03,058 --> 00:44:08,021
In light of that information if confirmed,
bail is denied on Johnson.

677
00:44:11,733 --> 00:44:13,610
I stand strong...

678
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:18,656
I refuse to testify
and we win...

679
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:22,619
Can I get a pass? I beg of you.

680
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,288
Swear it.

681
00:44:26,206 --> 00:44:28,457
Swear it on your kid's grave.

682
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:30,418
You won't kill me.

683
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:34,255
How am I gonna kill a ghost?

684
00:44:43,098 --> 00:44:46,392
Me and Willy Boy Johnson
beat the case

685
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:48,954
due to the lack of credibility
of the government's witness.

686
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:53,858
Find the defendants John Joseph
Gotti and Wilfred Johnson not guilty.

687
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:58,446
As for Willy Boy
it's another story.

688
00:45:00,949 --> 00:45:03,283
Dominic always took
charge of the fireworks.

689
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:05,035
He's not kidding.

690
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:08,497
It's my gift to that.
You do the fireworks the way I like you.

691
00:45:08,498 --> 00:45:10,458
That's not what I...

692
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:15,879
- Look.
- I can not believe...

693
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,633
- You would have some fun?
- Let's go have some fun.

694
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,136
Is there a problem here?

695
00:45:22,137 --> 00:45:24,990
We are shutting it down Gotti.
This is an un-permitted street gathering.

696
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:26,784
And illegal fireworks at this premises.

697
00:45:26,808 --> 00:45:30,227
What are you talking about?
We've been doing this for 20 years.

698
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:32,632
Let me ask you something.
You gonna put these good people in jail

699
00:45:32,656 --> 00:45:34,083
because they are
proud of their country?

700
00:45:34,107 --> 00:45:36,483
Is that right? You got
my lawyer on the phone?

701
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:38,295
- He is standing by.
- You got bail money?

702
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:39,611
With interests.

703
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:41,114
Send them up!

704
00:45:57,297 --> 00:45:59,507
This is your turf, John.

705
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:09,767
Look at this. I'm good at my deal.

706
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:11,686
Go ahead, taste.

707
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:17,525
It's not bad. I know.

708
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:22,530
Hey. Excuse me.

709
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:25,491
I don't normally do this, but
I saw you walking over.

710
00:46:25,492 --> 00:46:29,536
I'd hate myself the rest of my life
if I don't come and talk to you.

711
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:31,147
Stop it, Johnny, you're not funny.

712
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:34,185
- Wait, do we know each other?
- What? You lose your memory

713
00:46:34,209 --> 00:46:36,210
at the military academy or something?

714
00:46:37,629 --> 00:46:39,630
It's me. Kim.

715
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:42,550
Come on John! Joey Rugs' daughter!

716
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,052
I'm sorry. It's just...

717
00:46:45,053 --> 00:46:47,513
You looked different.

718
00:46:47,931 --> 00:46:49,515
Guess I grew up.

719
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,559
I guess you did.

720
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:56,647
You wanna get a beer or something?

721
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:59,066
John, I'm 16.

722
00:47:01,069 --> 00:47:03,029
You wanna get a soda?

723
00:47:03,488 --> 00:47:04,781
Yeah, that sounds nice.

724
00:47:05,114 --> 00:47:06,574
Alright. Let's go.

725
00:47:08,618 --> 00:47:10,161
See you.

726
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:12,371
Joey Rugs...

727
00:47:13,373 --> 00:47:16,417
Paul wants to see you.
And I hold him back as long as I can.

728
00:47:16,626 --> 00:47:18,795
The fucking Angelo Tapes again?

729
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:21,338
It's got nothing to do with Angelo.

730
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:23,090
Paul has decided to break up

731
00:47:23,091 --> 00:47:24,383
your crew.

732
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:29,388
He's gonna break up the crew?
The fuck does that mean?

733
00:47:29,389 --> 00:47:30,722
If Paul goes to prison,

734
00:47:30,723 --> 00:47:33,453
he wants to make sure
that everybody knows he's still the boss.

735
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:36,311
It's like Carlo fucking
Gambino all over again.

736
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:38,730
Everyone knows that it
should have been you.

737
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:41,775
What you want and what we get
are 2 different things.

738
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:44,266
Well, he wants reassurance. Forget
about it. No, he will get it.

739
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:46,966
You better fucking agree with him.
Or at least look like you do.

740
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:48,407
He doesn't deserve it, Neil!

741
00:47:48,408 --> 00:47:51,493
Look, you gotta earn yours
like we did.

742
00:47:51,494 --> 00:47:54,538
- What world are you living in?
- All fucking Paul is

743
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:56,433
about his money.
That's his get off. That's it.

744
00:47:56,457 --> 00:48:00,199
- Coming from a fucking degenerate gambler.
- You are goddamn right.

745
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,511
Can't take it with you.

746
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:09,738
If Paul makes a move on Angelo...

747
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:12,974
You'll live with it.
If he gives you that choice.

748
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:16,060
There is no choice.
There is only what you do.

749
00:48:16,144 --> 00:48:19,146
Listen to me.
You kill the boss's boss...

750
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:20,606
I will defend my position.

751
00:48:20,607 --> 00:48:23,002
- You will bring down hellfire.
- I'll do what I gotta do.

752
00:48:23,026 --> 00:48:25,570
Not as long as I'm alive.

753
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:30,199
Jesus...

754
00:48:30,742 --> 00:48:34,203
I can't get over Willy Boy.

755
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:39,125
Shows that life is full of surprises.

756
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:43,087
He's been with you since
Fulton Rockaway boys huh?

757
00:48:43,755 --> 00:48:46,006
A bunch of punk kids

758
00:48:46,007 --> 00:48:48,068
who had the balls to take
on one of my poker game.

759
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:49,760
You never know.

760
00:48:49,761 --> 00:48:51,595
He broke my fucking heart.

761
00:48:51,596 --> 00:48:53,180
You gave him a pass?

762
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:59,186
Attack from the outside,
you can deal with.

763
00:48:59,187 --> 00:49:02,607
But attack from the inside...
you're history.

764
00:49:03,191 --> 00:49:06,818
Once you take that first step,
there is no turning back.

765
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:10,781
You either succeed, or you
are lost in enemy territory.

766
00:49:10,782 --> 00:49:13,409
And if you miss, you die.

767
00:49:14,077 --> 00:49:16,162
And all your friends will die.

768
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:19,749
So you will need DeCicco.

769
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:22,394
If he is on board, then
Joe Piney would join you.

770
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:26,547
He will take care of the old timers.
And Gallo will go along.

771
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:33,095
"The Lord is my shepherd."

772
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:37,350
He maketh me to lie down
in the green grass...

773
00:49:37,517 --> 00:49:40,769
He leadeth me beside the still waters

774
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:43,105
he restoreth my soul.

775
00:49:43,106 --> 00:49:46,108
He leadeth me in the path of righteousness

776
00:49:46,109 --> 00:49:47,901
for his name sake.

777
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:51,906
Either I walk through the
valley of shadow of death,

778
00:49:51,948 --> 00:49:53,950
I will fear no evil,

779
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,452
for thou art with me.

780
00:50:03,042 --> 00:50:04,919
In the presence of my enemies.

781
00:50:23,271 --> 00:50:24,641
In the name of the Father...

782
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:28,401
Obviously Paul couldn't make it, but
he sends his prayers.

783
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:47,043
Let me tell you something.

784
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:50,589
Neil could have taken the family
from Paul anytime he wanted.

785
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:52,258
Everybody knows that.

786
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:54,885
Paul, up on there, the hill.

787
00:50:54,886 --> 00:50:57,888
We gotta kiss his ring
like he was the pope.

788
00:50:57,889 --> 00:50:59,181
Fuck pope.

789
00:51:00,892 --> 00:51:03,936
I hear you. I am with you.

790
00:51:15,114 --> 00:51:17,074
You will need DeCicco.

791
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:19,553
If he is on board then
Joe Piney will join you.

792
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:21,662
He will take care of the old timers.

793
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:25,207
And Gallo would go along.

794
00:51:25,792 --> 00:51:28,338
D.B. is important he was through
that all the rough ventures and

795
00:51:28,362 --> 00:51:31,148
make sure that everybody knows
it's only business we are talking.

796
00:51:31,172 --> 00:51:34,508
But you are gonna need the approval
of the other families.

797
00:51:34,509 --> 00:51:38,113
Franck and Sammy Bull
will represent Brooklyn.

798
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:41,640
The Lucchese won't be a problem.
You got Pescuchi on your side,

799
00:51:41,641 --> 00:51:44,434
so the Bonnanos, we
are not worried about.

800
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:46,853
Leave the Colombos to Angelo.

801
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:50,399
He will fill the pause with
Freddy DeVico and Benny Cans.

802
00:51:50,775 --> 00:51:52,568
And that leaves The Chin.

803
00:51:52,819 --> 00:51:54,111
Chin...

804
00:51:54,445 --> 00:51:57,031
Do you think I am
stickler for the rules?

805
00:51:57,156 --> 00:51:59,241
Chin will not be happy no matter what.

806
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:01,201
But he will be outnumbered so...

807
00:52:01,202 --> 00:52:04,120
We could have a peaceful transition
he will just have to accept.

808
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,873
I dunno.
Paul and Chin are pretty tight.

809
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:08,227
They got lot of money on the street.

810
00:52:08,251 --> 00:52:09,960
You'll take care of that after.

811
00:52:09,961 --> 00:52:12,587
You use D.B. for that...
Now listen,

812
00:52:12,588 --> 00:52:15,423
No body has gotten in on Chin's act.

813
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:18,385
On the contrary, with Paul out of the way,
with Chins

814
00:52:18,386 --> 00:52:19,738
free and clear

815
00:52:19,762 --> 00:52:22,472
I have no doubt that the other
families will back you.

816
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:24,934
But only if you have support
of all five bureaus.

817
00:52:25,184 --> 00:52:27,978
Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan,

818
00:52:27,979 --> 00:52:30,564
Staten Island, the Bronx.

819
00:52:32,024 --> 00:52:34,068
Ain't that a fist?

820
00:52:40,825 --> 00:52:42,826
So it comes down to:

821
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:44,160
is what you wanna be?

822
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:48,748
You wanna be on the boss?

823
00:52:48,749 --> 00:52:51,460
Because we are gonna do this thing.
We are gonna do it right.

824
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:54,797
It's gonna be Cosa Nostra,
the Cosa Nostra till I die.

825
00:52:55,548 --> 00:52:57,049
Atta-boys, John.

826
00:52:59,302 --> 00:53:02,138
Paul has set up a
dinner next Thursday.

827
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:03,848
Friends only.

828
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:08,352
To discuss the reorganization
of the family.

829
00:53:14,025 --> 00:53:18,320
December 16, 1985

830
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:22,073
We are on a piece of work.

831
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:24,910
It's a big job. There
is no 2 ways about it.

832
00:53:24,911 --> 00:53:26,703
It's gotta be done.

833
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:28,455
Get them their coats and hats.

834
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:34,002
Hats is all anyone's gonna remember seeing.

835
00:53:34,003 --> 00:53:35,689
We are on the corner
from the United Nations.

836
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:37,441
They will take the fucking
Russians are coming.

837
00:53:37,465 --> 00:53:39,884
Listen up. Pay attention.

838
00:53:40,927 --> 00:53:42,303
We are hitting Paul.

839
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:51,787
And anyone else is in the car with him.

840
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:04,950
It's gonna take place
at Sparks Steak House.

841
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:13,292
That's up on 46th, between 2nd and 3rd.

842
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:18,315
He has a 6 o'clock reservation.

843
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:19,589
At 18 o'clock.

844
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:24,511
There is gonna be a lot of

845
00:54:24,512 --> 00:54:27,681
Christmas shoppers,
but that's perfect for us.

846
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:32,788
We are gonna get in and out in a zing,

847
00:54:32,812 --> 00:54:34,813
like the Pittsburgh Steelers.

848
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:38,692
It's to kill or be killed.

849
00:54:38,693 --> 00:54:40,152
Let's go.

850
00:55:12,852 --> 00:55:14,645
- How you doing?
- Good.

851
00:55:16,564 --> 00:55:18,481
A whiskey and ice please.

852
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:19,775
So, Franck...

853
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:23,362
this business with the Gotti's crew..

854
00:55:24,405 --> 00:55:26,240
It's very troublesome to Paul.

855
00:55:37,793 --> 00:55:39,670
I know you like John.

856
00:55:39,962 --> 00:55:41,629
Hell, I like to.

857
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:43,191
Now that Neil's out of the picture,

858
00:55:43,215 --> 00:55:44,842
Paul just wants to...

859
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:47,720
shake the whole registration.

860
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:02,202
And he wants you to be comfortable with it.

861
00:56:06,197 --> 00:56:07,656
Paul is late.

862
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:13,369
Paul is here.

863
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,791
He's not gonna make dinner.

864
00:56:25,216 --> 00:56:26,675
We gotta go.

865
00:56:50,866 --> 00:56:53,993
This assassination of Paul Castellano,

866
00:56:53,994 --> 00:56:57,956
has local and federal officials looking for
the men who did it and for the motive.

867
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:00,723
Finding either are both
extremely difficult,

868
00:57:00,747 --> 00:57:02,896
given the secrecy
of organized crime.

869
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:05,839
We may never know why
Castellano was killed.

870
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:08,383
Louis Young is standing
by in Staten Island,

871
00:57:08,384 --> 00:57:10,177
at the Castellano home.

872
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:14,139
Mafia kingpin Paul
"Big" Paul Castellano,

873
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:17,809
was gunned down gangland style
in midtown, Manhattan.

874
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:19,887
The 70 year old, reputed,
head of the largest and

875
00:57:19,911 --> 00:57:22,022
the most powerful crime
family in the country,

876
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:23,523
the Gambino family.

877
00:57:23,524 --> 00:57:24,709
Uncle Ang?

878
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:25,836
Where is my father?

879
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:27,796
- He's gonna be here soon.
- Is everything OK?

880
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:29,237
He is OK.

881
00:57:29,238 --> 00:57:30,948
I learned for Paul.

882
00:57:32,575 --> 00:57:35,076
It would be a terrible
mistake to think that

883
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:38,705
this is a good time going
around and shooting up people.

884
00:57:38,706 --> 00:57:40,456
He is on a jet,
he's over Iceland

885
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:44,128
and the stewardess comes up and she says:
"My name is Pussy Galore".

886
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:46,880
He says: "I must be dreaming."

887
00:57:53,345 --> 00:57:54,847
Fellas...

888
00:57:57,766 --> 00:57:59,977
We don't know who killed Paul and Tommy.

889
00:58:00,352 --> 00:58:01,979
But we are gonna find out.

890
00:58:02,646 --> 00:58:04,522
Conduct our investigation,

891
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:06,358
get to the bottom of this.

892
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:08,777
That being said...

893
00:58:09,904 --> 00:58:13,282
our job is now to maintain continuity.

894
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:18,578
Make sure nobody thinks
family is falling apart here.

895
00:58:18,579 --> 00:58:19,872
So...

896
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,167
I nominate...

897
00:58:24,376 --> 00:58:25,794
John Gotti.

898
00:58:33,427 --> 00:58:34,928
I second the motion.

899
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:54,030
To the new boss!

900
00:59:20,516 --> 00:59:22,059
Here he is.

901
00:59:22,935 --> 00:59:24,728
Congratulations, John.

902
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:33,237
How does it feel?

903
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:36,698
Feels like times have changed.
It's good.

904
00:59:36,782 --> 00:59:38,866
I mean how does it feel to be here?

905
00:59:38,867 --> 00:59:40,827
This was Neil's joint.

906
00:59:40,828 --> 00:59:42,013
It feels right.

907
00:59:42,037 --> 00:59:44,789
It feels like it's what
he would have wanted.

908
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:47,167
It feels...

909
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:50,337
Wherever he is, he is watching us.

910
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:54,674
Yeah. And he ain't the only one.

911
00:59:54,675 --> 00:59:56,125
I'll talk to you about that...

912
00:59:56,635 --> 00:59:59,846
Nick Vilante's widow lives
upstairs.

913
01:00:00,055 --> 01:00:02,181
We can't take her out on the street,

914
01:00:02,182 --> 01:00:04,934
but if we have a serious conversation

915
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:08,563
or she whining or it's annoying, we give
a little something,

916
01:00:08,564 --> 01:00:11,024
she vacates the premise for 20 minutes

917
01:00:11,025 --> 01:00:13,443
and then we take care of it.

918
01:00:16,739 --> 01:00:19,491
I would like some
to clear the floor.

919
01:00:21,744 --> 01:00:24,413
Let them know.
Let everybody know.

920
01:00:25,664 --> 01:00:28,750
Now, everybody comes to me.
They come to me.

921
01:00:35,341 --> 01:00:36,633
"The new godfather"

922
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:41,471
John Gotti has been the most
note-worthy figure

923
01:00:41,472 --> 01:00:42,889
in the last 50 years.

924
01:00:45,684 --> 01:00:48,811
The head of the Gambino crime
family, a real life godfather.

925
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:50,688
Shots fired here before the Steak house,

926
01:00:50,689 --> 01:00:52,691
were heard around the world.

927
01:00:55,527 --> 01:00:57,737
People shout at me from cars:

928
01:00:57,738 --> 01:01:00,448
"Say hello to John!"

929
01:01:00,449 --> 01:01:02,742
The most powerful crime boss in America.

930
01:01:02,743 --> 01:01:06,113
Does he glorify the Mafia? Yeah. He's
glorified the Mafia. He's the headhunter.

931
01:01:12,461 --> 01:01:14,277
If I have to go to
another fucking wedding

932
01:01:14,301 --> 01:01:16,280
I think I'd rather go
back to Lewisberg.

933
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:19,486
Jesus, everybody

934
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:23,054
have been there. There was good-fellas,
there was non good-fellas.

935
01:01:23,055 --> 01:01:25,306
My brother Pete clocked, 75 guys

936
01:01:25,307 --> 01:01:26,599
come up to me.

937
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,810
Those 75 guys come up to talk to me

938
01:01:28,811 --> 01:01:31,020
but they got nothing to offer me.

939
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:32,890
Conversation, if
conversation is the cow it'd

940
01:01:32,914 --> 01:01:34,858
be the fattest fucking guy in in the world.

941
01:01:37,277 --> 01:01:38,612
Jesus...

942
01:01:45,786 --> 01:01:47,079
Rudy?

943
01:01:47,496 --> 01:01:48,681
Can I talk to you a minute?

944
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:49,998
Yeah, John.

945
01:01:58,298 --> 01:02:01,008
You deliver the envelope
to Dominic's wife yesterday?

946
01:02:01,009 --> 01:02:02,760
Yeah, just like you told me.

947
01:02:02,761 --> 01:02:04,887
No. Not just like I told you.

948
01:02:04,888 --> 01:02:07,348
- I dropped it off.
- Who did you bring with you?

949
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:09,100
Well, I was gonna bring my niece...

950
01:02:09,101 --> 01:02:11,185
But you didn't. You didn't.
One simple rule.

951
01:02:11,186 --> 01:02:14,230
Don't you ever go to a guy's
house while he's away

952
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:15,731
and see his wife alone.

953
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,400
And if you ever do this again,

954
01:02:17,401 --> 01:02:20,695
I'll perk a bus upon your
ass fucking sideways!

955
01:02:20,696 --> 01:02:21,946
You understand that?

956
01:02:21,989 --> 01:02:23,281
Yeah, John.

957
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,660
Sorry, John.

958
01:02:27,536 --> 01:02:28,829
Sorry.

959
01:02:45,596 --> 01:02:47,264
Stay seated.

960
01:02:50,476 --> 01:02:52,310
John's getting too much press.

961
01:02:53,061 --> 01:02:54,312
Ought to learn to duck.

962
01:02:54,313 --> 01:02:56,772
He's got too much pride to duck.

963
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:59,343
If he don't give a fuck
he's gonna die in jail, the gutter.

964
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:02,696
Making us look bad.

965
01:03:03,071 --> 01:03:04,740
Then this DeCicco...

966
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:07,576
We know he arranged the hit on Paul.

967
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:09,995
That can't go unchecked.

968
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:14,499
Otherwise, we got capos working their
left N right in home.

969
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:16,668
Not now, not ever.

970
01:03:42,945 --> 01:03:44,321
Frankie!

971
01:03:49,201 --> 01:03:51,161
Frank! Frankie!

972
01:04:00,504 --> 01:04:01,797
Whore!

973
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,141
It was meant for you.

974
01:04:13,475 --> 01:04:14,893
What are you talking about?

975
01:04:15,102 --> 01:04:18,229
I am telling you it was,
you know who did it.

976
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:20,482
I heard it on good authority.

977
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:24,527
He and Gas pipe Casso are like
two piece in a fucking pie.

978
01:04:24,528 --> 01:04:27,178
Who heard... You heard! Your ears
are bigger than your mouth.

979
01:04:27,489 --> 01:04:29,907
OK first of all, I'm friends with Chin.

980
01:04:29,908 --> 01:04:32,243
Sam and Pipe go way back, am I right Sam?

981
01:04:32,244 --> 01:04:33,703
Am I right Sam?

982
01:04:33,704 --> 01:04:36,954
What? And they are all grieving about Paul?
Why would they grieve about Paul?

983
01:04:36,957 --> 01:04:40,334
Look, whoever killed Paul

984
01:04:40,335 --> 01:04:42,378
did everybody a fucking favor.

985
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:45,316
Maybe it was the cops, yeah, you know.
They put us against each other.

986
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,968
That's what they want us to believe.
Am I right?

987
01:04:48,302 --> 01:04:50,177
Let's take care of business.

988
01:04:50,178 --> 01:04:52,848
Angelo tried to take matters
into his own hands.

989
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:55,891
With an unsanctioned hit
on Gas pipe Casso.

990
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:57,936
That didn't workout too well for nobody.

991
01:05:00,522 --> 01:05:02,482
- Gas pipe?
- Who the fuck are you?

992
01:05:41,855 --> 01:05:43,731
Good guys, bad guys,

993
01:05:43,732 --> 01:05:46,693
come in many different colors.
New York's finest

994
01:05:46,735 --> 01:05:49,362
serving 2 masters.

995
01:06:20,102 --> 01:06:21,811
I got all day.

996
01:06:23,271 --> 01:06:24,814
I got whole week.

997
01:06:26,066 --> 01:06:27,650
My man, it's just me and you.

998
01:06:27,651 --> 01:06:30,612
We are just, hanging out in the basement.

999
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:32,697
Just give me a name.

1000
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:35,992
Tell me who it was.

1001
01:06:44,543 --> 01:06:46,294
That hurts, doesn't it?

1002
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,757
I can make it stop.

1003
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,969
I can make it all go away.

1004
01:06:56,221 --> 01:06:57,806
Give me a name.

1005
01:06:58,557 --> 01:07:00,141
Angelo Ruggierio.

1006
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,353
Angelo Ruggierio.

1007
01:07:03,395 --> 01:07:04,688
Thank you.

1008
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:06,481
Thank you very much.

1009
01:07:12,904 --> 01:07:14,406
You handle it,

1010
01:07:14,906 --> 01:07:17,533
Angelo try to whack another
main guy without permission?

1011
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:19,118
You got no proof of that.

1012
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:21,078
The shooter need a little encouragement,

1013
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:23,914
but he told Gas pipe,
he named Angelo.

1014
01:07:23,915 --> 01:07:26,333
And there is no reason to disbelief it.

1015
01:07:26,334 --> 01:07:28,419
Do I believe everything I hear?
No!

1016
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:30,713
So I'm gonna do my own
investigation in this.

1017
01:07:30,714 --> 01:07:32,048
Oh yeah?

1018
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:34,759
How's the other investigation going?

1019
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:36,654
Heard anything about the
Sparks Steak House?

1020
01:07:36,678 --> 01:07:40,098
Yeah. Their Caesar salad
is to die for.

1021
01:07:41,558 --> 01:07:45,186
Angelo has been asking for this a long
time. There is no dispute about that.

1022
01:07:45,187 --> 01:07:46,896
Let me tell you something Chin.

1023
01:07:46,897 --> 01:07:50,357
Nobody touches Angelo. Nobody.

1024
01:07:50,358 --> 01:07:52,902
If it's true that he acted
without my approval,

1025
01:07:52,903 --> 01:07:55,697
I'll put him on a fucking shelf like that.

1026
01:07:55,739 --> 01:07:59,408
I know Angelo's more than a brother to you.
But Angelo went off the record.

1027
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:01,053
- This was unsanctioned.
- OK. But let me tell you something.

1028
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:04,830
Life means more than anything to Angelo.

1029
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:06,207
OK. He is a war horse.

1030
01:08:06,208 --> 01:08:09,044
It means more than it does to you or to me.

1031
01:08:09,503 --> 01:08:11,814
He wakes up thinking about it,
he goes to bed thinking about it.

1032
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:14,965
If I put him on a shelf for life
it's worse than putting a fucking

1033
01:08:14,966 --> 01:08:16,885
bullet through his heart.

1034
01:08:19,346 --> 01:08:20,930
Then I vow to close this matter.

1035
01:08:21,807 --> 01:08:23,641
The matter is closed.

1036
01:08:24,017 --> 01:08:25,077
The last time

1037
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:28,229
they moved me John, do you know
the only thing I took with me?

1038
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,566
Your indictment. That was it.

1039
01:08:32,567 --> 01:08:36,529
And do you know why I brought it? Because
I don't give a fuck about my cancer.

1040
01:08:36,530 --> 01:08:40,241
I don't care what they do to me in here.
My concerns are you.

1041
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:42,220
I know that.

1042
01:08:42,244 --> 01:08:45,330
I must have read it 50 times
and I tell you I don't see it.

1043
01:08:45,914 --> 01:08:48,416
I told you once I would
follow you over at cliff.

1044
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:50,918
And I meant it.
But I am thinking about my family now.

1045
01:08:50,919 --> 01:08:54,547
Your family? What family are you talking
about? You talking about your 400

1046
01:08:54,548 --> 01:08:56,216
brothers, cousins and uncles?

1047
01:08:56,466 --> 01:09:00,136
Being a man is not being some guy
who is looking for closure, John.

1048
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:02,096
My freedom and my life

1049
01:09:02,097 --> 01:09:04,182
take a back seat to my duty
and manhood.

1050
01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:06,768
These are my standards, John.

1051
01:09:07,102 --> 01:09:09,645
OK, now listen up. This is important.

1052
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:11,981
Never do anyone a small injury.

1053
01:09:11,982 --> 01:09:13,482
You wanna hurt someone,

1054
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:16,652
hurt him so bad
he will never come back at you.

1055
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:20,156
Neil used to say to me:
"The boss is the boss is the boss."

1056
01:09:20,949 --> 01:09:23,117
It ain't titles that honor men.

1057
01:09:23,118 --> 01:09:25,328
It's men that honor titles.

1058
01:09:48,518 --> 01:09:50,353
What did you do?

1059
01:09:56,651 --> 01:10:00,738
I did what I thought was best for you.

1060
01:10:03,283 --> 01:10:04,951
I save your life Ang.

1061
01:10:05,035 --> 01:10:06,703
I all I can do.

1062
01:10:07,913 --> 01:10:09,330
Son of a bitch killed Frank!

1063
01:10:12,292 --> 01:10:13,792
I am not going to war

1064
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:16,629
with the Chin for the sake
of Gas pipe fucking Casso.

1065
01:10:16,838 --> 01:10:18,339
I ain't doing it.

1066
01:10:18,757 --> 01:10:20,382
Now listen to you

1067
01:10:20,383 --> 01:10:22,746
Just 10 kinds of
shitstorms coming down

1068
01:10:22,770 --> 01:10:25,156
on us and you know
what I had to do?

1069
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:27,723
We had to have a meeting
with the Commission.

1070
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:30,643
Why? Because of you. Because of you!

1071
01:10:33,647 --> 01:10:36,816
Every boss wanted you dead.

1072
01:10:37,067 --> 01:10:38,359
Everyone.

1073
01:10:40,487 --> 01:10:42,488
You're on the shelf for life.

1074
01:10:42,489 --> 01:10:43,781
That's it.

1075
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:45,240
Go.

1076
01:11:46,845 --> 01:11:47,863
Get out of here.

1077
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:50,014
Uncle Ang, he needs you.

1078
01:11:50,557 --> 01:11:51,659
He made a big fucking mistake.

1079
01:11:51,683 --> 01:11:54,643
Don't say another word. Don't you say
one word against your father.

1080
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:56,187
You hear me?

1081
01:12:00,025 --> 01:12:01,317
You hear me?

1082
01:12:15,206 --> 01:12:16,350
I was forced.

1083
01:12:16,374 --> 01:12:19,085
I can not treat him
differently than others.

1084
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:22,504
If I let you violate my rules,

1085
01:12:22,505 --> 01:12:25,675
the very principles that we live by,

1086
01:12:25,717 --> 01:12:28,845
it weakens me and that weakens you.

1087
01:12:29,179 --> 01:12:32,307
Now, one day, you may be the shot caller,
you may be the one,

1088
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:34,962
there is making the rules,
and then you would be responsible

1089
01:12:34,986 --> 01:12:37,895
for enforcing those rules.
You know what I'm saying?

1090
01:12:37,896 --> 01:12:39,772
You give me my middle name Angelo.

1091
01:12:39,773 --> 01:12:42,025
How do you expect me to
turn my back on him?

1092
01:12:44,069 --> 01:12:47,739
You pray that I don't know about it.

1093
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:51,868
I love him too.

1094
01:12:53,203 --> 01:12:54,495
Go to bed.

1095
01:13:01,836 --> 01:13:04,797
Who cares if he goes to see Angelo?

1096
01:13:04,798 --> 01:13:07,049
It's not like John's a part of that life.

1097
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:08,843
Victoria, please...

1098
01:13:08,885 --> 01:13:10,219
Don't start. OK?

1099
01:13:32,659 --> 01:13:34,577
Will the defendant please rise?

1100
01:13:37,705 --> 01:13:39,665
Has the jury reached a verdict?

1101
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:44,336
"We, the jurors, in the above case"

1102
01:13:44,337 --> 01:13:48,132
"find the defendant, John
Joseph Gotti, not guilty."

1103
01:13:48,550 --> 01:13:50,968
I won this trial
fair and square.

1104
01:13:50,969 --> 01:13:53,679
Thanks to little down payment
to one of the jurors.

1105
01:13:53,888 --> 01:13:57,100
But by 3rd victory over the government,
the media nicknamed me

1106
01:13:57,142 --> 01:13:58,767
"The Teflon God".

1107
01:13:58,768 --> 01:13:59,727
I guess it stuck.

1108
01:13:59,728 --> 01:14:01,353
Mr Gotti, are you the head of the

1109
01:14:01,354 --> 01:14:03,522
- Gambino crime family?
- I'm head of my family.

1110
01:14:03,523 --> 01:14:05,376
Ms Gotti, do you know what your
husband does for a living?

1111
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:07,026
He provides.

1112
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:43,729
- Do you know why we're here?
- No.

1113
01:14:46,858 --> 01:14:48,828
- Do you know everybody in this room?
- Yes.

1114
01:14:51,321 --> 01:14:53,072
This is a society of brothers.

1115
01:14:53,448 --> 01:14:55,116
The Cosa Nostra.

1116
01:14:55,158 --> 01:14:56,867
You are now about to be inducted as

1117
01:14:56,868 --> 01:14:58,953
a member of the Gambino family.

1118
01:14:59,579 --> 01:15:01,955
Honor this oath. If you divulge

1119
01:15:01,956 --> 01:15:04,666
any secret of
this family, your soul

1120
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:06,084
will burn like this saint.

1121
01:15:06,085 --> 01:15:09,922
Never raise your hands made man.
Or quote with the made man's wife

1122
01:15:09,923 --> 01:15:11,775
you will be killed.
You don't fuck with bums,

1123
01:15:11,799 --> 01:15:14,134
engage the civilians.

1124
01:15:14,135 --> 01:15:16,553
Use of drugs, prohibited.
Lastly,

1125
01:15:16,554 --> 01:15:18,306
most importantly
we don't like rats.

1126
01:15:19,766 --> 01:15:21,142
We kill rats.

1127
01:15:22,393 --> 01:15:25,603
You are questioned by law enforcement?
You tell them to go fuck themselves.

1128
01:15:27,315 --> 01:15:28,815
You are now reborn.

1129
01:15:28,816 --> 01:15:30,443
This is your baptism.

1130
01:15:30,902 --> 01:15:32,487
And we are your family.

1131
01:15:34,906 --> 01:15:36,199
Come here.

1132
01:16:02,517 --> 01:16:04,893
I would like you to meet your new soldier.

1133
01:16:04,894 --> 01:16:06,395
This is your boss. Your chief.

1134
01:16:10,525 --> 01:16:12,485
This is the proudest moment of my life.

1135
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:18,491
I am so fucking proud of you.

1136
01:16:23,079 --> 01:16:24,329
Look at us!

1137
01:16:24,372 --> 01:16:25,790
Look at us!

1138
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:32,880
Hey.

1139
01:16:34,632 --> 01:16:36,175
Come on.

1140
01:16:37,885 --> 01:16:39,178
Hi Elisa...

1141
01:16:46,144 --> 01:16:47,686
Johnny.

1142
01:16:47,687 --> 01:16:50,605
Like I said, it's getting tougher.
It's not getting easier.

1143
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:54,234
You look around you. You got a
few good soldiers, am I right?

1144
01:16:54,235 --> 01:16:55,963
- Yeah dad, I think you are right.
- OK.

1145
01:16:55,987 --> 01:16:59,823
But this is not the time to make 20 bucks.
You know what kind of guys I need?

1146
01:16:59,824 --> 01:17:02,576
I need guys
that do more than just kill

1147
01:17:02,577 --> 01:17:05,370
I need guys whose hearts
beat the same,

1148
01:17:05,371 --> 01:17:06,747
otherwise, this won't work.

1149
01:17:06,748 --> 01:17:09,750
And the law is coming down hard on us.
You know that.

1150
01:17:09,751 --> 01:17:11,004
Of course, if it comes to worse,

1151
01:17:11,028 --> 01:17:12,980
we could find you a safe house,
get you out of the country.

1152
01:17:13,004 --> 01:17:14,838
I don't run.

1153
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:16,757
And I don't hide in shadows either.

1154
01:17:16,758 --> 01:17:19,885
You know what I need?
I need one year on the street uninterrupted

1155
01:17:19,886 --> 01:17:22,888
and I will build something
that nobody can destroy,

1156
01:17:22,889 --> 01:17:27,351
100 years from now, we are both dead but it
will be and continue to be a good thing.

1157
01:17:28,144 --> 01:17:30,062
Being one hell of a legacy to leave.

1158
01:17:30,063 --> 01:17:33,024
A legacy. Be it
an hour from now, be it tonight

1159
01:17:33,066 --> 01:17:36,485
be it a 100 years from now, when we're
gone, it will be the Cosa Nostra.

1160
01:17:36,486 --> 01:17:39,048
And I'm not talking about the gangs,
I'm not talking about clans.

1161
01:17:39,072 --> 01:17:43,034
I'm talking about New York, far to
the fucking west coast and back.

1162
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:45,536
It's gonna be the way
I say it's gonna be.

1163
01:17:49,082 --> 01:17:51,500
About a year after I put him on a shelf

1164
01:17:51,501 --> 01:17:54,211
Angelo Ruggierio died of cancer.

1165
01:17:54,212 --> 01:17:57,172
Ang... I know I hurt you.

1166
01:17:57,173 --> 01:17:58,840
But you've fucked up.

1167
01:17:58,841 --> 01:18:02,386
And I had to do
what was best for the family.

1168
01:18:05,264 --> 01:18:06,556
Frankly,

1169
01:18:06,557 --> 01:18:08,851
I think he died of a broken heart.

1170
01:18:16,567 --> 01:18:18,610
By the way, I almost forgot...

1171
01:18:18,611 --> 01:18:22,365
Sammy thinks that you should
be running your own crew now.

1172
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:25,742
Your credit to your father..

1173
01:18:25,743 --> 01:18:29,580
Normally I don't show you no favor, but
this time, I'mma help you out.

1174
01:18:29,622 --> 01:18:31,790
I'mma hand pick your crew.

1175
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:34,919
I'mma give you Bobby.
Because I trust him with my life.

1176
01:18:35,253 --> 01:18:37,254
And I trust him with your life.

1177
01:18:37,255 --> 01:18:39,631
- Is that okay with Bobby?
- Go ask.

1178
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:42,300
What? Be under a little punk like you?

1179
01:18:42,301 --> 01:18:44,512
Holy Virgin... never in life.

1180
01:18:44,971 --> 01:18:46,722
It's you, the boss, now.

1181
01:18:46,848 --> 01:18:48,765
You say the word, I will go for a...

1182
01:18:48,766 --> 01:18:51,056
You are already hurt, you're
getting married today.

1183
01:18:58,693 --> 01:19:00,152
Yeah. Where is Victoria?

1184
01:19:05,616 --> 01:19:07,118
Hey. Good to see you.

1185
01:19:08,161 --> 01:19:09,453
Congratulations.

1186
01:19:10,246 --> 01:19:11,539
Congratulations.

1187
01:19:11,956 --> 01:19:13,749
Nice work, John. Nice work.

1188
01:19:15,918 --> 01:19:17,211
Vic?

1189
01:19:17,962 --> 01:19:19,547
Hello. How is it going?

1190
01:19:19,839 --> 01:19:22,007
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

1191
01:21:37,643 --> 01:21:41,689
"Neil used to say:
This life of ours is a wonderful life."

1192
01:21:44,233 --> 01:21:46,026
"If we can get away with it."

1193
01:21:46,694 --> 01:21:50,655
The man some people consider to be
organized crime's boss of all bosses,

1194
01:21:50,656 --> 01:21:53,908
John Gotti, was indicted today for
the 4th time in 5 years.

1195
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:56,077
Gotti is charged with the 1985 murder

1196
01:21:56,078 --> 01:22:00,206
of the mob boss Paul Castellano.
The prosecutors hopes their best testimony,

1197
01:22:00,207 --> 01:22:02,667
this time will come from
Gotti's own mouth.

1198
01:22:02,668 --> 01:22:05,587
You look at me like I don't know who I am.
I am the new boss.

1199
01:22:05,588 --> 01:22:08,883
I do whatever the fuck I want, without
stepping all the bounds.

1200
01:22:08,966 --> 01:22:11,509
Now I'm telling you.
If something happens to me,

1201
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:14,512
and I end up in a can,
I want Sammy to be the acting boss.

1202
01:22:14,513 --> 01:22:16,014
- Is that clear?
- Clear.

1203
01:22:16,015 --> 01:22:17,265
These are my wishes.

1204
01:22:17,391 --> 01:22:20,310
I would be a billionaire
if I was looking to be poor.

1205
01:22:20,311 --> 01:22:22,312
All I want is this sandwich.

1206
01:22:22,313 --> 01:22:25,815
Every time I fucking turn around,
there is a new company.

1207
01:22:25,816 --> 01:22:28,318
Every time we got a partner
or the boss to fuck with us.

1208
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:30,029
We kill them...

1209
01:22:32,156 --> 01:22:34,326
- He's a yellow dot.
- I took your word for, Sam.

1210
01:22:34,617 --> 01:22:36,452
I allowed it to be done.

1211
01:23:07,942 --> 01:23:10,193
Yeah he probably won't.
He is not gonna be here

1212
01:23:10,194 --> 01:23:12,780
for breakfast.
They took him away the last night.

1213
01:23:17,952 --> 01:23:19,369
Please give your name.

1214
01:23:19,370 --> 01:23:20,995
Salvatore Gravano.

1215
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:22,331
Do they call you Salvatore?

1216
01:23:23,749 --> 01:23:25,125
Sammy.

1217
01:23:25,126 --> 01:23:27,816
Mr Gravano, could you please
speak in through the microphone.

1218
01:23:29,296 --> 01:23:30,546
Sure.

1219
01:23:31,215 --> 01:23:33,092
I didn't follow my own advice.

1220
01:23:35,136 --> 01:23:36,594
Never trust anyone who

1221
01:23:36,595 --> 01:23:38,304
hasn't done time.

1222
01:23:38,305 --> 01:23:40,682
That's where men are made.

1223
01:23:40,683 --> 01:23:43,685
Sammy the bull became Sammy the rat.

1224
01:23:43,686 --> 01:23:47,147
The government cut him a deal after
admitting in his part in

1225
01:23:47,148 --> 01:23:49,358
19 murders and
testifying against me.

1226
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:54,863
John Joseph Gotti,
you have been convicted on all counts of

1227
01:23:54,864 --> 01:23:57,991
criminal racketeering, murder, and
conspiracy.

1228
01:23:57,992 --> 01:24:02,162
You are hereby remanded to serve a
term of no less than 5 life sentences.

1229
01:24:02,538 --> 01:24:05,749
You will also be assessed
to 50 dollar court fee.

1230
01:24:05,791 --> 01:24:07,667
Do you have anything to say?

1231
01:24:07,668 --> 01:24:09,169
Yeah, your honor.

1232
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:11,421
The 5 life time bids, that's okay,

1233
01:24:11,422 --> 01:24:15,384
but the 50 dollars surcharge...
You are a tough guy.

1234
01:24:16,844 --> 01:24:20,013
Today... another milestone in the
fight against organized crime.

1235
01:24:20,014 --> 01:24:21,931
The Teflon is gone

1236
01:24:21,932 --> 01:24:26,186
the don is covered with Velcro
and every charge in the indictment stuck.

1237
01:24:28,397 --> 01:24:29,916
Mayhem outside Brooklyn's
federal court house

1238
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:32,442
as John Gotti gets life.

1239
01:24:32,443 --> 01:24:33,813
And his supporters cry foul.

1240
01:24:36,197 --> 01:24:39,033
Demanding a retrial
they rushed police line...

1241
01:24:39,283 --> 01:24:42,702
They pulled a lot of dirty tricks.
I don't believe there are witness.

1242
01:24:42,703 --> 01:24:45,538
Then tried to break into the
court to free the mafia boss.

1243
01:24:45,539 --> 01:24:48,500
He's a good guy.
He does a lot for the community, you know?

1244
01:24:48,501 --> 01:24:49,751
Put him away for nothing.

1245
01:24:50,127 --> 01:24:52,420
After today's arrest his supporters smashed

1246
01:24:52,421 --> 01:24:55,048
and overturned cars.
The verdict on John Gotti

1247
01:24:55,049 --> 01:24:56,884
is less likely to be overturned.

1248
01:24:57,551 --> 01:24:59,062
Law enforcement officials
fear that a violent

1249
01:24:59,086 --> 01:25:00,572
power struggle may happen
within Gotti's family.

1250
01:25:00,596 --> 01:25:02,598
May happen within Gotti's family.

1251
01:25:02,681 --> 01:25:06,434
And ironically, the only
one who may be able to keep the peace

1252
01:25:06,435 --> 01:25:07,685
is John Gotti.

1253
01:25:09,647 --> 01:25:11,565
My loyal crewman, Eddie Lino

1254
01:25:11,941 --> 01:25:13,358
was the first to go down.

1255
01:25:22,201 --> 01:25:25,621
Bobby Boriello, my closest
friend and my son's right arm

1256
01:25:25,663 --> 01:25:26,955
was next.

1257
01:25:29,917 --> 01:25:32,294
That's the life.
They understood that.

1258
01:25:43,889 --> 01:25:45,306
What's going on?

1259
01:25:45,307 --> 01:25:48,769
There is a contract out on me
and the rest of Sammy's crew.

1260
01:25:49,562 --> 01:25:52,689
- Who's behind it?
- Jimmy Brown and Joey Fanatti.

1261
01:25:54,233 --> 01:25:56,610
Jimmy Brown and Joey Fanatti...

1262
01:25:59,530 --> 01:26:01,198
They are after you too Johnny.

1263
01:26:05,411 --> 01:26:08,872
"Like father, like son".

1264
01:26:10,583 --> 01:26:14,586
- Why are you pissed off?
- I had to read about it!

1265
01:26:14,587 --> 01:26:16,212
It's on the cover of the paper!

1266
01:26:16,213 --> 01:26:19,132
- What papers?
- Our son is a target!

1267
01:26:19,133 --> 01:26:23,428
- The Daily News? The fucking post?
- Yeah the Daily News and the Post.

1268
01:26:23,429 --> 01:26:25,305
I already buried a son.

1269
01:26:25,306 --> 01:26:28,808
You want me to bury another
then you will bury me too.

1270
01:26:28,809 --> 01:26:32,228
You swore to me in our own bed,

1271
01:26:32,229 --> 01:26:35,148
you promised that you would not
bring him into that world.

1272
01:26:35,149 --> 01:26:37,358
What world? What world
are you talking about?

1273
01:26:37,359 --> 01:26:39,360
Tell me the world you're talking about!

1274
01:26:39,361 --> 01:26:42,614
I brought him into this world,
you brought him into the life.

1275
01:26:43,073 --> 01:26:45,742
Ah come on, shut the fuck up!
You don't know what...

1276
01:26:46,493 --> 01:26:48,287
Where are you going? Get back here!

1277
01:26:48,829 --> 01:26:50,079
Fuck!

1278
01:27:27,701 --> 01:27:31,371
I am not gonna beat around the bush.
I am gonna ask you a question.

1279
01:27:31,413 --> 01:27:33,873
According to your answer, one
of us is gonna stand down.

1280
01:27:33,874 --> 01:27:37,627
The chief ordered this?
No. So don't play dumb with me.

1281
01:27:37,628 --> 01:27:39,689
This fucking nonsense about
Sammy's and his crew

1282
01:27:39,713 --> 01:27:41,548
you telling me it came from my father?

1283
01:27:42,716 --> 01:27:44,801
Then I suggest you stand down my friend.

1284
01:27:44,802 --> 01:27:46,237
Oh, you're prepared to defend these guys?

1285
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:49,681
No. I am prepared to defend my father.
Whatever he says goes. Period.

1286
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:07,824
Okay.

1287
01:28:14,748 --> 01:28:19,377
Five organized crime families
are in a state of a

1288
01:28:19,378 --> 01:28:23,214
New people are moving up taking the place
of the older ones who are now in prison

1289
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:24,841
or who ever killed.

1290
01:28:29,972 --> 01:28:33,391
Locked up, or held under indictment,
virtually, every

1291
01:28:33,392 --> 01:28:38,021
boss of every family in New York city
and throughout the US.

1292
01:29:05,716 --> 01:29:07,718
You can't be fucking kidding me...

1293
01:29:08,093 --> 01:29:09,383
What the hell is going on?

1294
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:12,001
What the hell is going on?
What do you think is going on?

1295
01:29:12,056 --> 01:29:13,348
Jesus...

1296
01:29:14,308 --> 01:29:15,892
Kids, come to daddy. Come here.

1297
01:29:17,102 --> 01:29:19,938
I will be gone for a little while.

1298
01:29:20,439 --> 01:29:21,815
Come here.

1299
01:30:06,110 --> 01:30:09,154
Don't worry about daddy.
I will be back in a little while.

1300
01:30:25,921 --> 01:30:27,630
We are today

1301
01:30:27,631 --> 01:30:31,176
4 federal indictments
charging a total of 40 defenses

1302
01:30:31,218 --> 01:30:34,554
with a wide spread pattern of
racketeering and other crimes

1303
01:30:34,721 --> 01:30:37,849
including multiple extortion,
murder conspiracy,

1304
01:30:37,850 --> 01:30:40,477
telecommunication fraud, illegal gambling,

1305
01:30:40,519 --> 01:30:42,187
money laundering...

1306
01:30:43,105 --> 01:30:47,316
Defendant's charge include, John A.
Gotti, also known as "Junior",

1307
01:30:47,317 --> 01:30:49,902
who was alleged to have exercise

1308
01:30:49,903 --> 01:30:53,489
supervisor control over the Gambino family

1309
01:30:53,490 --> 01:30:56,284
since his father John J.
Gotti was convicted

1310
01:30:56,285 --> 01:30:59,912
of federal racketeering charges in 1992.

1311
01:30:59,913 --> 01:31:01,581
These are just bullshit charges.

1312
01:31:01,999 --> 01:31:03,499
John, there's no way

1313
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,658
that they can tie you to
any of those specific crimes.

1314
01:31:05,682 --> 01:31:06,771
They don't have to.

1315
01:31:06,795 --> 01:31:08,721
It's the recoil conspiracy,
that's the problem.

1316
01:31:08,745 --> 01:31:11,025
They just have to prove I'm
a member of the enterprise.

1317
01:31:11,049 --> 01:31:12,652
- We can beat them.
- And then what?

1318
01:31:12,676 --> 01:31:15,970
They just throw more charges at
me, like they did with my father.

1319
01:31:15,971 --> 01:31:17,472
I've had enough.

1320
01:31:17,764 --> 01:31:20,975
I have been pulling back.
I am ready to move on with my life.

1321
01:31:20,976 --> 01:31:22,986
Are you saying what I'm
think you're saying?

1322
01:31:28,442 --> 01:31:29,692
Alright.

1323
01:31:38,785 --> 01:31:42,747
John, if that's what you want to do, if
you're ready to walk away from this life,

1324
01:31:43,248 --> 01:31:44,309
I am happy for you.

1325
01:31:44,333 --> 01:31:49,253
Just understand there are potential
consequences to that decision.

1326
01:31:49,254 --> 01:31:52,173
And there gonna be people out there
who are gonna be very unhappy

1327
01:31:52,174 --> 01:31:53,318
with the decision you make.

1328
01:31:53,342 --> 01:31:57,137
That's why Charlie, you need to arrange
for me a meeting with my father.

1329
01:31:57,679 --> 01:32:00,307
And he's is to come for me directly.
He is dying.

1330
01:32:00,641 --> 01:32:02,350
He was my cause.

1331
01:32:03,602 --> 01:32:06,605
Now it's time to move on.
I want closure.

1332
01:32:09,107 --> 01:32:11,957
John, I got no cancer in my brain
and I got no cancer in my heart.

1333
01:32:12,194 --> 01:32:16,239
But what I wouldn't do, to have one
more time to go into that court room

1334
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:19,034
and show them what a man
is, break their holes.

1335
01:32:19,159 --> 01:32:21,244
You show them what a man in.

1336
01:32:21,245 --> 01:32:23,413
You show them what it takes to have this.

1337
01:32:29,378 --> 01:32:32,088
Now, we only got 5 minutes left.

1338
01:32:33,090 --> 01:32:36,593
I don't know when or if
I will ever see you again.

1339
01:32:37,010 --> 01:32:40,638
And I don't know if I got through
to you or not, but I know,

1340
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:42,724
you got a lot of thinking to do.

1341
01:32:44,017 --> 01:32:45,393
I know.

1342
01:32:48,272 --> 01:32:50,439
I miss seeing you, John.

1343
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:52,734
You have no idea how
much I miss seeing you.

1344
01:32:53,235 --> 01:32:54,295
You know,

1345
01:32:54,319 --> 01:32:56,154
this meeting, today,

1346
01:32:56,530 --> 01:32:59,658
was worth 55 years
hanging upside down.

1347
01:33:00,158 --> 01:33:02,576
Because now you know how I feel.

1348
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:05,121
I love you and I adore you...

1349
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:06,998
I know.

1350
01:33:07,874 --> 01:33:09,334
So...

1351
01:33:13,338 --> 01:33:16,341
You do what you have to do.

1352
01:33:16,383 --> 01:33:18,050
And don't worry about me.

1353
01:33:18,051 --> 01:33:20,095
It doesn't make sense.

1354
01:33:21,096 --> 01:33:22,681
What will be will be.

1355
01:33:23,515 --> 01:33:26,685
You stand up strong, put your head up.

1356
01:33:28,395 --> 01:33:29,813
Don't Cry.

1357
01:33:29,855 --> 01:33:31,856
Don't let this have this satisfaction.

1358
01:33:33,108 --> 01:33:34,401
Come on.

1359
01:34:03,221 --> 01:34:06,182
PLEA AGREEMENT

1360
01:34:17,819 --> 01:34:18,921
Scissors.

1361
01:34:18,945 --> 01:34:20,238
Here sir.

1362
01:34:21,198 --> 01:34:25,160
What are you looking at me for?
You are gonna be here when I'm 82.

1363
01:34:34,878 --> 01:34:36,963
- You are beautiful.
- Thanks Gotti.

1364
01:34:37,130 --> 01:34:39,591
You ever met my wife much?

1365
01:34:41,551 --> 01:34:43,344
Why you fighting so hard?

1366
01:34:43,345 --> 01:34:46,264
If you keep this, they are just
gonna send you back to solitary.

1367
01:34:46,556 --> 01:34:48,766
Every day I am alive

1368
01:34:48,767 --> 01:34:51,435
is to fuck your government.

1369
01:34:51,436 --> 01:34:52,729
You understand?

1370
01:34:55,524 --> 01:34:58,485
My son Peter was at my bed
side till the very end.

1371
01:34:58,777 --> 01:35:00,987
I didn't want Vicky or
girls to see me like that.

1372
01:35:01,446 --> 01:35:04,782
I made Vicky promise
and she respected my wishes.

1373
01:35:04,783 --> 01:35:06,409
He is in a lot of pain.

1374
01:35:07,994 --> 01:35:09,954
I know that Morphine's no longer working.

1375
01:35:09,955 --> 01:35:12,123
Now, we can give him Ativan.

1376
01:35:12,124 --> 01:35:14,208
It will induce a coma.

1377
01:35:14,209 --> 01:35:16,961
He will be alive, but
he won't feel the pain.

1378
01:35:23,135 --> 01:35:24,719
Think about this, Peter.

1379
01:35:25,053 --> 01:35:26,513
It's your call.

1380
01:35:33,395 --> 01:35:35,355
You keep your head up...

1381
01:35:36,022 --> 01:35:37,732
and be strong.

1382
01:35:39,359 --> 01:35:40,652
Okay?

1383
01:35:41,278 --> 01:35:42,945
Promise me.

1384
01:35:42,946 --> 01:35:44,239
I promise.

1385
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:46,574
Alright.

1386
01:35:50,662 --> 01:35:53,164
Hey yo J! Check it out!

1387
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:06,760
One of the high profile
mobsters of recent times,

1388
01:36:06,761 --> 01:36:10,264
John Gotti, died today
in a prison hospital in Missouri,

1389
01:36:10,265 --> 01:36:12,349
after a battle with throat cancer.

1390
01:36:12,350 --> 01:36:14,768
Gotti was known as "The
Teflon Don"

1391
01:36:14,769 --> 01:36:17,855
or "the deper don,
nickname due to his taste"

1392
01:36:17,856 --> 01:36:21,400
for wearing fancy double breasted suits.

1393
01:36:21,401 --> 01:36:23,694
Gotti was acquitted
a number of times

1394
01:36:23,695 --> 01:36:27,364
prior to being sentenced to
5 consecutive life terms

1395
01:36:27,365 --> 01:36:28,782
in 1992.

1396
01:36:28,783 --> 01:36:30,785
John Gotti dead today

1397
01:36:30,911 --> 01:36:32,537
at age 61.

1398
01:37:01,399 --> 01:37:03,859
Everybody here knows
that he was a great man.

1399
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:06,839
Look he might have been in jail, but you
know something, nobody is the saint.

1400
01:37:06,863 --> 01:37:09,365
He didn't go around killing civilians,

1401
01:37:09,574 --> 01:37:11,993
normal people of the street
or anything like that.

1402
01:37:12,035 --> 01:37:13,744
He killed his own kind.

1403
01:37:13,745 --> 01:37:15,747
"John Gotti forever"

1404
01:37:23,547 --> 01:37:26,340
When he went to prison,
the crime rate

1405
01:37:26,341 --> 01:37:28,319
started going up.
The street wants to taken over.

1406
01:37:28,343 --> 01:37:31,805
It was a lot cleaner neighborhood
when Mr Gotti was around.

1407
01:37:48,613 --> 01:37:52,367
"John Gotti will live forever"

1408
01:38:04,129 --> 01:38:07,298
How could you be so naive?
Once they get you in,

1409
01:38:07,299 --> 01:38:08,757
you will never be free again.

1410
01:38:08,758 --> 01:38:12,220
They say you win this time but next time
they will make sure that you're gone.

1411
01:38:23,940 --> 01:38:25,608
This is bullshit!

1412
01:38:25,609 --> 01:38:27,821
A hundred more fucking years?
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

1413
01:38:27,845 --> 01:38:28,546
John! Calm Down!

1414
01:38:28,570 --> 01:38:30,989
No! My father told me they
would never let me go!

1415
01:38:31,031 --> 01:38:34,742
He told me that. They wanna
fight the legacy of John Gotti?

1416
01:38:34,909 --> 01:38:37,370
Well, let them fight John Gotti!

1417
01:38:41,249 --> 01:38:42,499
We would like to believe

1418
01:38:42,542 --> 01:38:46,671
that a trial in its purest form
is a search for the truth.

1419
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:50,674
But search for the truth requires
willingness to see the truth.

1420
01:38:50,675 --> 01:38:54,928
Yesterday, the prosecutor
spoke to you about what he perceived to be,

1421
01:38:54,929 --> 01:38:56,723
the courage of his witnesses.

1422
01:38:56,890 --> 01:39:00,017
Well the truth is,
speaking up behind someone

1423
01:39:00,018 --> 01:39:03,396
and shooting them in the
head is not an act of courage.

1424
01:39:03,563 --> 01:39:07,316
It's an act of deception,
it's a display of treachery,

1425
01:39:07,317 --> 01:39:10,986
and it's a demonstration of
a cold blooded willingness

1426
01:39:10,987 --> 01:39:12,739
to put their own interests

1427
01:39:12,822 --> 01:39:14,615
above that of anyone else,

1428
01:39:14,616 --> 01:39:16,700
regardless of the consequences.

1429
01:39:16,701 --> 01:39:19,912
Contrast that with the
courage required of John,

1430
01:39:19,913 --> 01:39:22,540
who admittedly was in that life,

1431
01:39:23,249 --> 01:39:26,461
but who paid for his
crimes with many years in prison.

1432
01:39:26,836 --> 01:39:29,797
But John had the courage
to walk away from that life.

1433
01:39:29,881 --> 01:39:33,426
The courage to tell
his dying father,

1434
01:39:33,468 --> 01:39:35,386
to whom the life was everything,

1435
01:39:35,512 --> 01:39:38,180
that his obligations were to his family,

1436
01:39:38,181 --> 01:39:39,849
not to a crime family.

1437
01:39:39,933 --> 01:39:42,852
But reality is John left the life
on his terms.

1438
01:39:43,144 --> 01:39:46,189
Cooperation in return
for a reduced sentence?

1439
01:39:47,107 --> 01:39:48,250
No thanks.

1440
01:39:48,274 --> 01:39:52,195
He said, "I will do my own
time for my own crimes."

1441
01:39:52,237 --> 01:39:54,863
In 11 years,

1442
01:39:54,864 --> 01:39:57,908
since then the government has spent
millions of taxpayer dollars

1443
01:39:57,909 --> 01:40:00,119
in five prosecutions.

1444
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:04,498
They shift John all across the country
under the most horrible conditions

1445
01:40:04,499 --> 01:40:08,377
and what they jokingly refer
to is "diesel therapy".

1446
01:40:08,378 --> 01:40:12,506
But in the end, they could not provide

1447
01:40:12,507 --> 01:40:17,136
even a single credible allegation
of any contact

1448
01:40:17,137 --> 01:40:20,098
between John and the enterprise.

1449
01:40:21,641 --> 01:40:25,520
Once again, the government just
refuses to see the truth.

1450
01:40:26,104 --> 01:40:28,689
When the government goes off the rails

1451
01:40:28,690 --> 01:40:31,483
driven by ego and obsession,

1452
01:40:31,484 --> 01:40:36,613
it's incumbent upon its citizens to
guide the government back on course.

1453
01:40:36,614 --> 01:40:39,241
In this system, in this courtroom,

1454
01:40:39,242 --> 01:40:42,954
you, the jury, are the
conscience of the government.

1455
01:40:43,621 --> 01:40:46,207
It's time to do the right thing.

1456
01:40:47,125 --> 01:40:48,835
Send him home.

1457
01:40:49,210 --> 01:40:51,129
Send him home to his wife and his kids.

1458
01:40:53,214 --> 01:40:56,759
Send him home to live the
life he chose to live.

1459
01:40:57,552 --> 01:40:58,845
He's earned it.

1460
01:41:08,062 --> 01:41:10,481
The government tried hard
to break Johnny boy,

1461
01:41:10,482 --> 01:41:12,399
but my son took him to task.

1462
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:14,735
5 trials in 37 months,

1463
01:41:14,736 --> 01:41:17,113
and the government
walked away with nothing.

1464
01:41:41,179 --> 01:41:44,014
Listen to me. And listen to me.

1465
01:41:44,015 --> 01:41:46,517
You are never gonna see
another guy like me

1466
01:41:46,518 --> 01:41:48,895
if you live to be 5 thousand.

1467
01:41:48,919 --> 01:41:52,919
