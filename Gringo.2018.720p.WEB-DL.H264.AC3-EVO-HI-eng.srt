This is because

reveal it to me... now?

Have I told you
about the two gorillas?

136
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:50,099
All right.
I read it in this book.

Two gorillas, right?

138
00:07:51,836 --> 00:07:54,003
And every day
they get fed carrots.

139
00:07:54,005 --> 00:07:55,805
And every day
they eat the carrots.

No problem. Chomp, chomp, chomp.
So delicious.

Except, one day, the handler, he
gives one of the gorillas a banana,

and the other guy
still gets his carrots,

and he doesn't wanna eat
the carrots.

Do you wanna tell me
what that is?

It's an

That's right. What do you
think it's telling me?

- Sanchez.
- Okay.

289
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,741
The report is telling you
that the inventory is light,

290
00:17:59,743 --> 00:18:02,478
as I am still selling your
product to Señor Villegas,

as you requested.

292
00:18:03,681 --> 00:18:05,581
We told you to cut him off.

293
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:08,284
With all due respect,
that's not the way it works.

294
00:18:08,286 --> 00:18:11,153
Uh, that's exactly
how it works.

295
00:18:11,155 --> 00:18:13,890
I make a product. I decide
who to sell it to. Right?

296
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:16,324
You get to decide if you want
a future with the company...

When you needed money,
you asked me...

301
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:29,240
When we needed money, we asked you to
sell some product off the books...

302
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,642
and not say anything to Harold.

303

Now, we don't need money.
We're telling you to stop.

- Yes.

We're gonna have people coming down here,
and they're gonna look things over,

307
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:45,555
and we wanna make sure
that everything is in order.

308
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:49,491
I understand, but Señor Villegas
is expecting his usual shipment.

309
00:18:49,493 --> 00:18:52,961
The Black Panther is
not someone to mess with.

of the big, bad cartels, right?

312
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,469
Not in Mexico.

313
00:19:00,471 --> 00:19:03,405
Well, as far as I'm concerned,
we are not in Mexico.

and I'm telling you,
in American,

316
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,979
to make sure
that the inventory's right.

317
00:19:10,981 --> 00:19:14,417
Yes. I mean, if you can
take care of 35 kids,

318
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:18,220
I think you can handle
one drug dealer.

319
00:19:18,222 --> 00:19:20,523
- No?
- <i>¿Comprende?</i>

320
00:19:20,525 --> 00:19:22,561
- Okay.
- Let's go.

00:19:27,498 --> 00:19:29,465
Have a nice day.

324
00:19:29,467 --> 00:19:30,836
Harold, let's go.

325
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,450
[Richard]
Harold, just so you know,

326
00:19:48,452 --> 00:19:50,553
the inventory thing
worried us.

327
00:19:50,555 --> 00:19:52,888
That's why we came down here
to speak to Sanchez,

328
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,856
just to make sure everything
was on the up-and-up.

329
00:19:54,858 --> 00:19:56,691
It's no reflection
on you.

330
00:19:56,693 --> 00:20:00,696
No, certainly not.
You know we value your work.

331
00:20:00,698 --> 00:20:03,932
- I was starting to think it might be something else.
- Well, you're hearing things.

332
00:20:03,934 --> 00:20:05,534
He's hearing things.

333
00:20:05,536 --> 00:20:09,872
Harold, when I was
in junior high,

334
00:20:09,874 --> 00:20:13,008
a rumor went around
that I let the lacrosse team

335
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:17,279
pull a train on me
in the Dairy Queen parking lot.

336
00:20:17,281 --> 00:20:19,582
I hated the lacrosse team.

337
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:22,384
They were the biggest
bunch of Waspy,

338
00:20:22,386 --> 00:20:26,389
turtle-dicked ass pirates
I ever met in my entire life.

339
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:29,057
- Here you are, señor.
- Thank you.

340
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:33,429
And I'd rather give that waiter a rim
job than eat at a fucking Dairy Queen.

341
00:20:33,431 --> 00:20:35,530
- What's a rim job?
- It's when...

342
00:20:35,532 --> 00:20:37,065
Don't believe
everything you hear

343
00:20:37,067 --> 00:20:38,633
is probably
the point here, right?

344
00:20:38,635 --> 00:20:40,670
Exactly.
You're gonna be fine.

345
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:42,274
We're not selling
the company.

346
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,243
All right?

347
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:50,648
I'll be right back.

348
00:20:53,917 --> 00:20:55,718
I don't think
he knows anything.

349
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,821
- I almost feel bad for the guy.
- Right.

350
00:20:58,823 --> 00:21:01,457
Someone should put him
out of his misery.

351
00:21:01,459 --> 00:21:02,557
Seriously.

352
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,927
No, I mean literally.

353
00:21:04,929 --> 00:21:08,367
Someone should literally put
him out of his fucking misery.

355
00:21:13,904 --> 00:21:15,036
You can go.

356
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:16,708
I will see you <i>mañana.</i>

357
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,012
Okay.

358
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:25,381
But when they married each
other, she was a fatty.

359
00:21:25,383 --> 00:21:28,784
- She was 50 pounds heavier than she is today.

Yeah,
I'm really tired.

- Hey, buddy.
- What did I miss?

367
00:21:41,898 --> 00:21:45,901
Uh, I'm gonna check some e-mails
and maybe hit the sauna

a little CrossFit.

369

- Then I'll see you guys in the morning.

My name is Ronaldo, and this
is my brother, Ernesto.

476
00:33:12,756 --> 00:33:17,191
Just... Just tell us
if you need something.

477
00:33:17,193 --> 00:33:21,696
Okay. Uh, actually, uh, do you know
where I can buy a cheap phone?

478
00:33:21,698 --> 00:33:24,035
Uh, yeah,
just across the street.

479
00:33:26,069 --> 00:33:28,202
- I just don't get it.
- There's nothing to get, babe.

480
00:33:28,204 --> 00:33:30,838
Seriously. I told you,
Nelly's just a friend.

481
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,043
You gotta let it go,
all right?

482
00:33:54,765 --> 00:33:55,700
No.

Medical marijuana is already
a multi-billion dollar industry.

491
00:34:36,306 --> 00:34:38,606
It's already up and running
in 20 states

492
00:34:38,608 --> 00:34:40,641
and the District of Columbia.

493

If you've got a card, you can legally
rip a bong in the Lincoln bedroom.

00:34:44,681 --> 00:34:46,083
Wow.

now, legally speaking,

00:34:50,253 --> 00:34:51,619
isn't this

[Richard]
Well, it's on it.

498
00:34:52,722 --> 00:34:54,222
It's not over it.

499
00:34:54,224 --> 00:34:56,758
There's a reason why we
set up the lab in Mexico.

500
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,494

503
00:35:06,402 --> 00:35:10,304
The future of marijuana
is this pill.

504
00:35:10,306 --> 00:35:12,273
You know this product
is revolutionary.

505
00:35:12,275 --> 00:35:15,242
You know that by the time
everybody else catches up,

506
00:35:15,244 --> 00:35:19,180
we will have established a brand
that can never be usurped.

507
00:35:19,182 --> 00:35:21,615
- Think Pfizer and Viagra.
- Yeah.

508
00:35:21,617 --> 00:35:23,688
They got there first.
There ain't no second.

Look... [sighs]

00:35:32,195 --> 00:35:35,500
most people will tell you
Buzz Aldrin walked on the moon.

511
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:39,900
But even a complete retard
will tell you

512
00:35:39,902 --> 00:35:41,805
Neil Armstrong did it first.

513
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,708
And do you know
why he went first?

514
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:51,579
- He was mission commander?
- 'Cause the hatch opened on his side?

515
00:35:51,581 --> 00:35:55,483
He went first because he pushed
Buzz Aldrin the fuck out of the way

516
00:35:55,485 --> 00:35:57,552
and seized history
by the ball sack.

517
00:35:57,554 --> 00:36:01,425
That's the story schools are afraid
to teach, but that's what happened.

518
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:04,829
I'm satisfied.

There is no policy.

Uh... Fuck.

611
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:21,583
There was a lot going out. We didn't have a

00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:18,476
- What?
- [Richard] Yeah, <i>la cuenta...</i>

629

[men shouting in Spanish]

630
00:41:21,177 --> 00:41:23,845
Just... Harold,
can we call you back?

631
00:41:23,847 --> 00:41:25,713
- What?
- <i>You got a number?</i>

632
00:41:25,715 --> 00:41:28,650
- Richard. Richard.
- No, I need to speak to legal.

633
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,217
Richard.
Richard, don't leave me...

634
00:41:30,219 --> 00:41:32,653
I'm gonna get somebody
in here who speaks Mexican.

635
00:41:32,655 --> 00:41:34,121
<i>No, Richard, don't leave me here!
Richard!</i>

636
00:41:34,123 --> 00:41:35,757
- Can you call us back?
- <i>Richard!</i>

637
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:36,894
Richard!

638
00:41:45,601 --> 00:41:46,804
<i>Gracias,</i> guys.

639
00:41:51,708 --> 00:41:52,643
<i>Vamos.</i>

640
00:41:59,315 --> 00:42:00,949
Shit.

641
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:04,851
Five million dollars for
someone in middle management.

642
00:42:04,853 --> 00:42:07,121
Do me a favor.
Just shut the fuck up.

643
00:42:07,123 --> 00:42:11,358
You with your whole fucking, "Hey,
Elaine, I got the perfect guy for us.

644
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,661
My good buddy, Harold Sinka."

645
00:42:13,663 --> 00:42:15,729
- Soyinka.
- "He's gonna fucking be perfect for the job.

646
00:42:15,731 --> 00:42:17,898
He won't ask any questions, not
gonna cause any fucking trouble."

647
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,202
This is
a fucking clusterfuck!

648
00:42:21,036 --> 00:42:22,202
Just stay focused.

649
00:42:22,204 --> 00:42:24,007
I am focused.

650
00:42:27,744 --> 00:42:31,144
[sighs] What do we do now?
Do we call the cops?

651
00:42:31,146 --> 00:42:34,315
Would it be such a bad thing
if he didn't come back?

652
00:42:34,317 --> 00:42:36,184
What are you talking about?

653
00:42:36,186 --> 00:42:39,854
We are not leaving Harold in
fucking Mexico. That's crazy.

654
00:42:39,856 --> 00:42:41,956
You're the one who said
put him out of his misery.

655
00:42:41,958 --> 00:42:44,726
I say crazy shit all the time.

656
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,327
I don't mean it literally.

657
00:42:46,329 --> 00:42:48,762
But you said, literally,
put him out of his misery.

658
00:42:48,764 --> 00:42:53,066
Oh, my fucking...
I meant not literally literally.

659
00:42:53,068 --> 00:42:55,269
"Literally" is
something people say now.

660
00:42:55,271 --> 00:42:57,938
- It doesn't mean a fucking thing.
- Okay.

661
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,941
They're going to be inspecting
the plant tomorrow,

662
00:42:59,943 --> 00:43:02,409
and if they find anything off,
this whole deal is shot.

663
00:43:02,411 --> 00:43:04,646
I don't need to tell you
what's gonna happen

664
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:08,016
[whispering] if the feds catch fucking
wind of any of this on any level.

665
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:09,320
We are completely fucked.

666
00:43:10,286 --> 00:43:11,885
I know a guy.

667
00:43:11,887 --> 00:43:13,755
Here we go again.
You know a fucking guy.

668
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:16,356
No, I know a guy who might be
really good for this kind of thing.

Boy.

672
00:43:26,101 --> 00:43:28,101
This is really bad timing.

673
00:43:28,103 --> 00:43:30,671
Fuck this. We've got this.

674
00:43:30,673 --> 00:43:32,440
Richard,
we fucking got this.

675
00:43:32,442 --> 00:43:35,108
We're a team.

676
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:38,746
Look, why don't I come over
to your loft tonight.

677
00:43:38,748 --> 00:43:40,947
We'll just...

678

- [pants unzip]
- I'm not in there yet.

679
00:43:43,353 --> 00:43:44,822
I'm still at that...

680

boutique hotel.

681
00:43:49,192 --> 00:43:51,061
You told me last week
you moved in.

682
00:43:52,094 --> 00:43:53,427
Did I tell you that?

683
00:43:53,429 --> 00:43:56,130
Did I tell... I'm
gonna make this call.

684
00:43:56,132 --> 00:43:59,202
I... I'm gonna just get
this thing sorted out.

685
00:44:00,836 --> 00:44:04,037
Um, except that
if I change my mind,

686
00:44:04,039 --> 00:44:06,840
I'm gonna give you a call,
which I probably will.

687
00:44:06,842 --> 00:44:09,045
But I'm, you know,
maybe just, uh...

688
00:44:10,112 --> 00:44:11,845
Whew!

689
00:44:11,847 --> 00:44:13,914
Yeah, so...
Yeah, I'll read that.

690
00:44:13,916 --> 00:44:15,853
Good meeting.

691
00:44:17,353 --> 00:44:19,019
- Mia.
- Hmm?

692
00:44:19,021 --> 00:44:20,857
Get my brother

Oh, yeah. Mitch?

00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:36,369
Yeah, one moment.

Mitch.

00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:46,884
Okay.

- [helicopter whirring]
- Hey, Rich!

703
00:44:50,987 --> 00:44:53,090
- Mitch!
- <i>How you doing, bro?</i>

704
00:44:54,157 --> 00:44:56,824
How's, uh... How's Nepal?

705
00:44:56,826 --> 00:44:59,760
Uh, Haiti. I'm in Haiti.

706
00:44:59,762 --> 00:45:01,162
Haiti. No, I knew that.

707
00:45:01,164 --> 00:45:03,264
How... How... How is it?

708
00:45:03,266 --> 00:45:05,266
It's a fucking mess
is what it is.

709
00:45:05,268 --> 00:45:07,300
Uh, we're doing what we can.

710
00:45:07,302 --> 00:45:09,970
Well, you're doing
God's work, so...

711
00:45:09,972 --> 00:45:11,842
No, the earthquake
was God's work.

712
00:45:13,041 --> 00:45:15,075
This is something else, man.

713
00:45:15,077 --> 00:45:18,880
You're seriously all, uh,
religious-y and stuff?

714
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:21,182
It's not religious.
It's spiritual.

715
00:45:21,184 --> 00:45:24,952
And I don't mock your
dirty little money-grabbing,

716
00:45:24,954 --> 00:45:27,320

717

No, it's not...
Dude, I'm not, I swear to God.

718
00:45:30,092 --> 00:45:33,961
It's just... I hear through Mom that you've
turned over a new leaf, and it's great.

719
00:45:33,963 --> 00:45:36,563
Mom's right. I've been good.

720
00:45:36,565 --> 00:45:39,066
I've been doing good things
with my life.

<i>I have a new path now. My mercenary
days are over. Look, what...</i>

722
00:45:42,438 --> 00:45:45,206
What do you want, Richard? You only
ever call if you want something,

723
00:45:45,208 --> 00:45:47,575
so let's get to that part... the
greedy part, the selfish part.

724
00:45:47,577 --> 00:45:50,344
All right.
You wanna help people, right?

725
00:45:50,346 --> 00:45:53,548
You wanna help people. Help me, and
I will make it worth your while.

726
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:55,983
And then you can build
these people a schoolhouse

727
00:45:55,985 --> 00:45:58,985
or a fucking GAP,
whatever the fuck they need.

728
00:45:58,987 --> 00:46:02,055
You know, might I remind you that
you were sent there six months ago

729
00:46:02,057 --> 00:46:05,092
to make a diplomat disappear.

730
00:46:05,094 --> 00:46:06,994
You want me
to fucking kill somebody?

731
00:46:06,996 --> 00:46:09,162
- <i>Have you lost your fucking mind?</i>
- Hey, man...

<i>Did you not hear anything
I just fucking said?</i>

733
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:16,470
I... I don't want... want you
to take anybody out for me.

734
00:46:16,472 --> 00:46:20,911
I'm just... No, I need you
to bring somebody back.

735
00:46:30,987 --> 00:46:33,621
- What phone is that?
- Hmm? Work gave it to me.

[Miles] Nice suit.

739
00:46:45,201 --> 00:46:47,538
Why would somebody wearing a posh
suit be staying at our shit motel?

740
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:54,075
Miles, he has that, like, shoulder
holster gun thing under his arms.

741
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:56,010
Maybe he's a cop.

742
00:46:56,012 --> 00:46:57,612
Or he's like a FBI guy.

743
00:46:57,614 --> 00:47:00,514
Or, no, a DEA guy.
Yeah, he's a DEA guy,

744
00:47:00,516 --> 00:47:02,650
on the trail
of some big drug thing,

745
00:47:02,652 --> 00:47:04,351
and he's about
to bust somebody.

Oh, yeah,
somebody's going down.

All right,
let's go, shall we?

- But I haven't finished my margarita yet.
- You can get more later.

Babe, we're in Mexico. They brush their

That's what I thought.

You're a winner, Elaine.

You've always been a winner.

00:50:10,139 --> 00:50:14,240
So you can...
you can take your... carrot

785
00:50:14,242 --> 00:50:19,412
and shove it up your
motherfucking lying buttocks,

786
00:50:19,414 --> 00:50:23,184
because I can have bananas.

787
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:26,086
Harold Soyinka can have
all the bananas.

788
00:50:26,088 --> 00:50:27,688
[beeps]

789
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:29,523
I'll have my bananas.

790
00:50:29,525 --> 00:50:33,293
[cell phone buzzing]

791
00:50:33,295 --> 00:50:35,595
[Richard]
Oh, God. Phone.

792
00:50:35,597 --> 00:50:37,731
- [buzzing]
- It's that weird number.

793
00:50:37,733 --> 00:50:39,599
Don't. Don't touch it.

794
00:50:39,601 --> 00:50:41,568
- You think it's him?
- [buzzing continues]

795
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:43,436
- Just don't think about it.
- [sighs]

796
00:50:43,438 --> 00:50:45,305
God, I'm such a shit.

797
00:50:45,307 --> 00:50:48,842
Bonnie, stop singing
sad Harold songs.

798
00:50:48,844 --> 00:50:52,412
I mean, how many times do I have
to tell you? Guilt is for losers.

799
00:50:52,414 --> 00:50:55,648
Now, you want something,
you go after it.

800
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:57,784
You fucking
make it happen.

801
00:50:57,786 --> 00:51:00,554
Harold? He just...
He never understood that.

802
00:51:00,556 --> 00:51:03,691
Now, I'm sorry.
He is a nice guy, but,

803
00:51:03,693 --> 00:51:07,193
you know, he never
fucking grew a pair.

804
00:51:07,195 --> 00:51:09,231
So it's that simple.

805
00:51:10,565 --> 00:51:11,734
I know.

806
00:51:15,271 --> 00:51:16,339
Thank you.

807
00:51:17,706 --> 00:51:19,275
[elevator door dings]

808
00:51:22,677 --> 00:51:25,311
Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!

809
00:51:25,313 --> 00:51:27,180
[kissing]

810
00:51:27,182 --> 00:51:29,416
[knocking]

811
00:51:29,418 --> 00:51:31,251
- [knocking]
- Who could that be?

812
00:51:31,253 --> 00:51:32,353
[sighs]
I don't know.

813
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:34,123
[pants zip]

814
00:51:39,728 --> 00:51:41,497
[knocking]

815
00:51:42,931 --> 00:51:46,566
- [Elaine] Surprise.
- Oh. Elaine.

816
00:51:46,568 --> 00:51:49,336
Uh... Okay.

817
00:51:49,338 --> 00:51:50,774
[door closes]

818
00:51:53,576 --> 00:51:56,610
So I see you moved in
after all.

819
00:51:56,612 --> 00:51:59,179
Uh, yeah.

820
00:51:59,181 --> 00:52:01,648
Who do we have here,
Richard?

821
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:02,786
Hmm?

822
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:07,124
- Do you have a name?
- [clears throat]

823
00:52:09,324 --> 00:52:10,759
It's a deaf girl.

824
00:52:11,594 --> 00:52:12,892
She's adorable.

825
00:52:12,894 --> 00:52:14,929
[mockingly]
Hello, deaf girl.

826
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:16,530
Bonnie, Elaine.
Elaine, Bonnie.

827
00:52:16,532 --> 00:52:18,731
Bonnie is my...

828
00:52:18,733 --> 00:52:20,733
She...
My interior decorator.

829
00:52:20,735 --> 00:52:22,436
That's interesting,
because I thought you said

830
00:52:22,438 --> 00:52:24,505
Harold's wife was
your interior decorator.

831
00:52:24,507 --> 00:52:25,608
[Richard] Yeah.

832
00:52:26,708 --> 00:52:28,275
- Oh.
- Yeah.

833
00:52:28,277 --> 00:52:30,644
Now I see why you wanted
to leave him in Mexico.

834
00:52:30,646 --> 00:52:32,278
What?

835
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,284
- Elaine.
- [Elaine laughs]

836
00:52:35,784 --> 00:52:38,719
Ooh. Would you show me
your stomach?

837
00:52:38,721 --> 00:52:41,521
'Cause I am
super curious.

838
00:52:41,523 --> 00:52:43,724
Excuse me?

839
00:52:43,726 --> 00:52:46,459
Richard here told me you were a
little fatty Patty back in the day.

840
00:52:46,461 --> 00:52:47,530
Isn't that right,
Richard?

841
00:52:50,599 --> 00:52:54,635
You know,
I've always wondered

842
00:52:54,637 --> 00:52:57,905
what do they do
with all that... extra skin?

843
00:52:57,907 --> 00:52:59,373
Ugh!

844
00:52:59,375 --> 00:53:03,276
Listen, I don't know
what is going on...

845
00:53:03,278 --> 00:53:05,447
That's right.
You don't know anything.

846
00:53:07,949 --> 00:53:10,586
And you certainly
don't know this guy.

847
00:53:12,521 --> 00:53:14,854
And I bet you don't know

848
00:53:14,856 --> 00:53:17,724
what I had on the plane
to Mexico yesterday.

849
00:53:17,726 --> 00:53:19,559
I don't care what you
had on the plane.

850
00:53:19,561 --> 00:53:20,793
The petite filet.

851
00:53:20,795 --> 00:53:23,296
Four glasses of champagne

852
00:53:23,298 --> 00:53:25,835
and Richard's cock in my mouth
in the first-class bathroom.

853
00:53:30,505 --> 00:53:32,773
Oh!

854
00:53:32,775 --> 00:53:35,644
It's... Bonnie, she...

855
00:53:36,411 --> 00:53:37,913
[groans]

856
00:53:39,648 --> 00:53:41,282
[Bonnie]
Come on, Riley.

857
00:53:41,284 --> 00:53:42,751
[barks]

858
00:53:45,954 --> 00:53:47,590
[door slams]

859
00:53:59,335 --> 00:54:01,905
- [sighs]
- Now, what do you say we christen this fucking place?

860
00:54:12,815 --> 00:54:15,048
"Live by the rules."

861
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:17,383
That is
what my father said.

862
00:54:17,385 --> 00:54:21,454
"Work hard, respect the boss,
and you become rich in America.

863
00:54:21,456 --> 00:54:24,325
Then you can come back home
a great success."

864
00:54:24,327 --> 00:54:25,892
Bullshit.

865
00:54:25,894 --> 00:54:29,963
- One hundred percent bullshit.
- Bullshit.

866
00:54:29,965 --> 00:54:33,967
Just the other day, Richard invited
me into his office to play chess.

867
00:54:33,969 --> 00:54:37,771
He wanted to show me how much he had
improved since we were at college.

868
00:54:37,773 --> 00:54:40,106
So, he's playing white,

869
00:54:40,108 --> 00:54:43,577
and he begins with f3.

870
00:54:43,579 --> 00:54:47,347
[laughs] Naturally,
I respond with e5.

871
00:54:47,349 --> 00:54:49,682
Huh? What does
this crazy man do? G4.

872
00:54:49,684 --> 00:54:51,818
Can you believe it? G4.

873
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:54,954
All I have to do
is move my queen to h4.

874
00:54:54,956 --> 00:54:56,623
- [fist hits table]
- Checkmate.

875
00:54:56,625 --> 00:54:58,624
But did I do it?

876
00:54:58,626 --> 00:54:59,927
No. Why?

877
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:02,595
Because I had my father's
voice in my head.

878
00:55:02,597 --> 00:55:06,066
"Respect the rules."

879
00:55:06,068 --> 00:55:08,769
As a rule, you do not
defeat your boss,

880
00:55:08,771 --> 00:55:10,570
especially when you
want a promotion.

881
00:55:10,572 --> 00:55:15,409
That is the story
of my time in America.

882
00:55:15,411 --> 00:55:18,010
Play by the rules?

883
00:55:18,012 --> 00:55:19,516
Bullshit.

884
00:55:30,992 --> 00:55:32,925
Are they your friends?

885
00:55:32,927 --> 00:55:33,862
Ah.

886
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,003
Friendly.

887
00:55:50,746 --> 00:55:52,916
Where...
Where is this other bar?

888
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:57,517
<i>Señor, donde...</i>

889
00:55:57,519 --> 00:55:59,521
<i>donde</i> the, uh...
the other bar?

890
00:56:05,494 --> 00:56:06,762
[phone beeps]

891
00:56:11,967 --> 00:56:13,103
[beeps]

892
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:18,604
I need the bathroom.
Amigo.

893
00:56:18,606 --> 00:56:20,844
Amigo, I need the bath...

894
00:57:13,561 --> 00:57:15,565
[chattering]

895
00:57:22,804 --> 00:57:25,707
[speaking Spanish]

896
00:57:54,802 --> 00:57:56,205
Mm-hmm.

897
00:57:59,208 --> 00:58:00,476
Yeah.

898
00:58:42,016 --> 00:58:45,586
Monarch butterflies go through
four generations each year.

899
00:58:45,588 --> 00:58:49,722
The first three generations hatch from their
cocoon state and live for up to six weeks,

900
00:58:49,724 --> 00:58:54,628
but the fourth generation continues to
live on for up to six or eight months...

901
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:57,197
- [phone beeping]
- so that they can migrate to a warmer climate

902
00:58:57,199 --> 00:59:00,032
and birth a new generation
in the spring.

903
00:59:00,034 --> 00:59:03,135
They are one of the great
miracles of nature.

904
00:59:03,137 --> 00:59:05,606
[woman speaking Spanish]

905
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:07,710
- I've gotta go, baby. Sorry.
- What?

906
00:59:08,911 --> 00:59:11,110
Babe.
[clicks tongue]

907
00:59:11,112 --> 00:59:14,817
- If you want to take pictures, you can do it.
- What the fuck?

908
00:59:29,063 --> 00:59:31,233
Babe, how many butterflies
do you need to see? Really.

909
00:59:32,266 --> 00:59:34,002
[scoffs]

910
00:59:34,969 --> 00:59:37,104
- What are we doing?
- What?

911
00:59:37,106 --> 00:59:40,007
- Why are you with me?
- [scoffs] Here we go.

912
00:59:40,009 --> 00:59:42,275
I'm serious, Miles.
Why are you with me?

913
00:59:42,277 --> 00:59:44,778
I don't know, Sunny.
Why are you with me?

914
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:46,179
[scoffs]

915
00:59:46,181 --> 00:59:47,884
[scoffs]
Fucking hell.

916
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:53,353
That guy looks like
he needs help.

917
00:59:53,355 --> 00:59:57,824
- [Miles] Well, hopefully someone will pick him up.
- That's the guy from the plaza.

918
00:59:57,826 --> 00:59:59,425
- [Miles] The one with the shoulder holster?
- Stop the car.

919
00:59:59,427 --> 01:00:02,729
- I'm not stopping the car for a fucking DEA agent.
- Stop the fucking car, Miles!

920
01:00:02,731 --> 01:00:04,267
- Please.
- [tires screeching]

921
01:00:04,833 --> 01:00:06,135
Sunny.

922
01:00:07,101 --> 01:00:08,605
You okay?

923
01:00:09,905 --> 01:00:12,304
- Sunny!
- Oh, my God!

924
01:00:12,306 --> 01:00:16,108
Are you all right? Sir? Sir,
can you hear me? Please?

925
01:00:16,110 --> 01:00:19,679
- Sunny, don't touch him!
- Oh, God, he's... Help me, Miles.

926
01:00:19,681 --> 01:00:21,884
[Sunny]
This is good. This is good.

927
01:00:23,085 --> 01:00:24,887
[horn honks]

928
01:00:27,289 --> 01:00:29,025
Right, we're here.

929
01:00:33,262 --> 01:00:35,030
[shutter clicking]

01:00:40,869 --> 01:00:42,735
[click, beeps]

931
01:00:42,737 --> 01:00:46,072
- Mr. Rusk?
- <i>What?</i>

932
01:00:46,074 --> 01:00:49,041
I was just wondering
about Harold.

933
01:00:49,043 --> 01:00:51,110
<i>What about him?</i>

934
01:00:51,112 --> 01:00:55,050
Well, he didn't sound so good yesterday,
and he didn't call in today. Is he okay?

935
01:00:57,452 --> 01:01:03,793
Mia, a simple quiz. The job of a receptionist
is to A: Make calls or B: Answer them?

936
01:01:05,226 --> 01:01:06,492
B?

937
01:01:06,494 --> 01:01:08,862
- B, yeah. Is this everything?
- [phone chimes]

938
01:01:08,864 --> 01:01:13,300
All company policies contracts,
leases, travel and insurance riders.

939
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:17,369
- Okay, great. Hey, great game the other night.
- [chiming continues]

940
01:01:17,371 --> 01:01:19,840
Uh, I'll be
in the conference room.

941
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:21,374
No more interruptions.

942
01:01:21,376 --> 01:01:23,242
Yes, sir, Mr. Rusk, sir.

943
01:01:23,244 --> 01:01:26,079
Keep that up, you'll
passive-aggressive yourself

944
01:01:26,081 --> 01:01:30,016
straight to the unemployment line, then you'll
have plenty of time to worry about Harold.

945
01:01:30,018 --> 01:01:31,284
Asshole.

946
01:01:31,286 --> 01:01:34,387
- [chiming continues]
- [exhales]

947
01:01:34,389 --> 01:01:37,324
- Hello.
- <i>Rich, it's Mitch.</i>

948
01:01:37,326 --> 01:01:39,992
Oh. Mitch.

949
01:01:39,994 --> 01:01:42,496
Hey. Oh, thank God.

950
01:01:42,498 --> 01:01:44,930
Yeah, t-t-tell me
you found him.

951
01:01:44,932 --> 01:01:47,266
I've tracked down dictators
in caves, Richard.

952
01:01:47,268 --> 01:01:48,904
I can find a guy
in middle management.

953
01:01:50,338 --> 01:01:52,405
Miles will be back soon
with your painkillers.

954
01:01:52,407 --> 01:01:54,343
Those are gonna make you
feel a lot better.

955
01:01:56,811 --> 01:02:00,780
Listen, you are very kind, but,
really, I will be okay on my own.

956
01:02:00,782 --> 01:02:03,450
I think you ought to have someone
just keep an eye on you.

957
01:02:03,452 --> 01:02:04,854
You're really beat up.

958
01:02:06,288 --> 01:02:09,188
I'm Sunny, by the way.

959
01:02:09,190 --> 01:02:12,559
I've never met anyone
named Sunny before.

960
01:02:12,561 --> 01:02:17,934
Well, I never met a Harold.
So we're even stephen.

961
01:02:21,503 --> 01:02:23,903
You know, if you
google the name Harold,

962
01:02:23,905 --> 01:02:28,809
it's the most common name with the least
amount of famous people associated with it.

963
01:02:28,811 --> 01:02:31,244
[chuckles] Well,
why don't you go by Harry?

964
01:02:31,246 --> 01:02:35,315
There are a lot of famous Harrys, like
that magician with the water tank.

965
01:02:35,317 --> 01:02:37,083
- [chuckles] Houdini.
- Yeah.

966
01:02:37,085 --> 01:02:40,253
And Harry S. Truman,
the president.

967
01:02:40,255 --> 01:02:44,224
And lots of singers.
Harry Potter, obviously.

968
01:02:44,226 --> 01:02:46,762
I love Harry Potter.
I've read every single book.

969
01:02:48,297 --> 01:02:51,063
Harry.

970
01:02:51,065 --> 01:02:54,066
- Harry Soyinka.
- Yeah, I like that.

971
01:02:54,068 --> 01:02:58,170
Okay, it's official. I'm gonna
call you Harry from now on.

972
01:02:58,172 --> 01:03:00,142
[elevator bell dings]

973
01:03:08,282 --> 01:03:10,418
- [speakerphone beeps]
- [woman] I've got Jerry on line one.

974
01:03:15,056 --> 01:03:17,557
- [beeps]
- Hey, Jerry.

975
01:03:17,559 --> 01:03:19,092
<i>Elaine.</i>

976
01:03:19,094 --> 01:03:21,561
I heard AFT was crying
when they got the news.

977
01:03:21,563 --> 01:03:24,363
<i>Guess they felt like they
danced with you all night too.</i>

978
01:03:24,365 --> 01:03:27,967
- <i>Someone's gotta go home alone, right?</i>
- Unless you're into threesomes.

979
01:03:27,969 --> 01:03:29,936
[laughs]

980
01:03:29,938 --> 01:03:31,604
- [knocking]
- [door opens]

981
01:03:31,606 --> 01:03:33,275
[laughing continues]

982
01:03:34,376 --> 01:03:37,610
Uh, Elaine, so, uh, anyway,

983
01:03:37,612 --> 01:03:39,612
been going over our departments.

984
01:03:39,614 --> 01:03:41,481
A lot of redundancies.

985
01:03:41,483 --> 01:03:43,182
Fire whoever you want.

986
01:03:43,184 --> 01:03:45,351
<i>Well, the problem might be
right at the top.</i>

987
01:03:45,353 --> 01:03:48,557
<i>With me and Marty, we're not
gonna need both you and Richard.</i>

988
01:03:50,025 --> 01:03:51,961
Have you guys talked about this?

989
01:03:57,199 --> 01:04:01,200
Hey, Jer, how about you and I get
together for a drink tonight?

990
01:04:01,202 --> 01:04:03,970
<i>Bat a few ideas around.
I don't know.</i>

991
01:04:03,972 --> 01:04:06,539
Well... Well, yeah. Okay.

992
01:04:06,541 --> 01:04:09,108
I'll let my secretary
get you all the information.

993
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:11,244
- That's great.
- Great.

994
01:04:11,246 --> 01:04:13,679
- Hey, Elaine...
- [line disconnects]

995
01:04:13,681 --> 01:04:14,983
Hello?

996
01:04:33,467 --> 01:04:35,270
[gasps] Fuck!

997
01:04:39,974 --> 01:04:44,344
Relax, Richard. It's under control.
This is a midnight run.

998
01:04:44,346 --> 01:04:46,278
Well, let's just talk about
the money later, okay?

999
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:49,249
<i>Richie, we'll talk about
the money now, all right?</i>

1000
01:04:49,251 --> 01:04:51,318
You tend to have a faulty
memory where money's concerned.

1001
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:54,153
<i>None of your business bullshit.</i>

1002
01:04:54,155 --> 01:04:57,990
One million for the ransom, 200
grand for me and the Haiti kids.

1003
01:04:57,992 --> 01:04:59,561
A million dollars.

1004
01:05:01,262 --> 01:05:04,063
A million dollars
for Harold Soyinka.

1005
01:05:04,065 --> 01:05:07,534
That's like paying a thousand
bucks for a Whopper Jr.

1006
01:05:07,536 --> 01:05:11,604
Yeah, well, think of it
as karma for banging his wife.

1007
01:05:11,606 --> 01:05:16,008
Great, just... just a million!
Just go do whatever you do.

1008
01:05:16,010 --> 01:05:18,581
All right. He'll be on
the next plane to Chicago.

1009
01:05:24,385 --> 01:05:26,086
[grunts]

1010
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:27,123
Thank you.

1011
01:05:32,059 --> 01:05:35,061
I... I know that whatever happened
to you is none of my business,

1012
01:05:35,063 --> 01:05:37,199
but is there anybody
that you need to call?

1013
01:05:39,367 --> 01:05:40,503
Uh...

1014
01:05:41,635 --> 01:05:43,572
[sighs] no.

1015
01:05:44,672 --> 01:05:46,474
My wife just left me.

1016
01:05:50,244 --> 01:05:52,347
But what about friends?

1017
01:05:53,481 --> 01:05:55,250
There's no one to call.

1018
01:06:02,324 --> 01:06:04,557
Well...

1019
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:08,364
I like the way you talk, Harry. You have
a really cool accent. Are you Jamaican?

1020
01:06:10,297 --> 01:06:12,298
- No.
- Oh.

1021
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:14,434
I'm Nigerian.

1022
01:06:14,436 --> 01:06:18,371
I don't know much about Nigeria, except
once I got an e-mail from a Nigerian prince

1023
01:06:18,373 --> 01:06:21,110
saying that he would give me a ton
of money if I helped him out.

1024
01:06:22,811 --> 01:06:26,079
You didn't send him
the money, did you?

1025
01:06:26,081 --> 01:06:28,280
'Cause you might have been
sending it to my uncle.

1026
01:06:28,282 --> 01:06:30,115
Your uncle does that?

1027
01:06:30,117 --> 01:06:33,318
Like, try and steal
from people like that?

1028
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:35,523
Yes, he's one of those people.

1029
01:06:37,358 --> 01:06:41,427
He tried to get my father
to join him, but he would not.

1030
01:06:41,429 --> 01:06:45,764
Now my uncle has lots of houses,
land, sports cars, and a yacht,

1031
01:06:45,766 --> 01:06:47,702
and my father is a poor man.

1032
01:06:49,603 --> 01:06:51,604
The world is upside down, Sunny.

1033
01:06:51,606 --> 01:06:54,840
I don't think it pays
to be a good person.

1034
01:06:54,842 --> 01:06:57,376
I mean, look at you.
You seem to be a good person.

1035
01:06:57,378 --> 01:07:00,179
Do you have a sports car?
Do you have a yacht?

1036
01:07:00,181 --> 01:07:02,684
I don't need
a sports car or a yacht.

1037
01:07:06,621 --> 01:07:10,824
Well, I'm glad you didn't
help my uncle pay for his.

1038
01:07:10,826 --> 01:07:14,260
I think you're wrong, Harry.
I think the world is just fine.

1039
01:07:14,262 --> 01:07:17,432
I think it's some of the
people in it who are wrong.

1040
01:07:20,135 --> 01:07:24,269
Trust me.
I have good instincts.

1041
01:07:24,271 --> 01:07:27,173
I make bad decisions,
but I have good instincts.

1042
01:07:27,175 --> 01:07:31,276
You'll see, things are gonna
start to get better for you.

1043
01:07:31,278 --> 01:07:33,646
- [yelling in Spanish]
- [Sunny screams] Harry!

1044
01:07:33,648 --> 01:07:35,215
What's going...

[shouting in Spanish]

1046
01:07:37,686 --> 01:07:40,256
- Wait!

01:07:41,889 --> 01:07:45,624
- Okay, okay, okay.

1048
01:07:45,626 --> 01:07:47,594
- Put it on!
- What-What? I don't understand!

1049
01:07:47,596 --> 01:07:50,329
In your face!
In your head!

1050
01:07:50,331 --> 01:07:52,132
- Your head!
- In your head!

1051
01:07:52,134 --> 01:07:54,300
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Put it on!

1052
01:07:54,302 --> 01:07:55,668
Put it on!

1053
01:07:55,670 --> 01:07:57,237
- [Sunny] Harry!
- [speaking Spanish]

1054
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:58,604
Harry.

[Miles] Sunny?

1057
01:08:09,284 --> 01:08:11,720
So I couldn't get
Paracetamol, but I did...

1058
01:08:24,565 --> 01:08:27,232
- Uh, oh! Ooh!
- Shh. Richard sent me.

1059
01:08:27,234 --> 01:08:28,670
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1060
01:08:33,807 --> 01:08:35,842
What about the ransom?
Why didn't they pay the ransom?

1061
01:08:35,844 --> 01:08:37,777
Who gives a fuck
about the ransom?

1062
01:08:37,779 --> 01:08:40,282
I'm gonna have you back in
the States in time for dinner.

Mm.

1065
01:09:04,972 --> 01:09:07,206
- Sunny.
- Miles?

1066
01:09:07,208 --> 01:09:09,209
- Miles!
- Sunny?

1067
01:09:09,211 --> 01:09:10,410
Miles?

1068
01:09:10,412 --> 01:09:12,211
Miles.

1069
01:09:12,213 --> 01:09:13,912
- Sunny!
- Miles, I'm in here!

1070
01:09:13,914 --> 01:09:16,449
- Oh.
- Are you...

1071
01:09:16,451 --> 01:09:18,451
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine!

1072
01:09:18,453 --> 01:09:19,919
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1073

- [beeping]
- What time is it?

1074
01:09:21,523 --> 01:09:23,889
What? I don't know.

1075
01:09:23,891 --> 01:09:26,226
- Oh, no.
- What?

1076
01:09:26,228 --> 01:09:27,195
Uh...

1077
01:09:28,662 --> 01:09:29,963
Oh, fuck.

[sighs]

1079
01:09:31,298 --> 01:09:34,000
- I've gotta go. Um...
- What?

1080
01:09:34,002 --> 01:09:35,835
I'm really sorry, babe.

1081
01:09:35,837 --> 01:09:38,271
Go to my room.
Lock the door.

1082
01:09:38,273 --> 01:09:39,671
Where are you going?

1083
01:09:39,673 --> 01:09:41,577
I'll be back soon.

Ah. [laughs]

No.

Hmm?

1090
01:10:27,721 --> 01:10:29,421
Harold.

Stop!

1097
01:10:44,038 --> 01:10:46,375
Stop! Shit!

1098
01:10:51,613 --> 01:10:52,648
Sorry.

1099
01:10:53,782 --> 01:10:55,516
- Excuse me.
- Hey!

1100
01:11:10,497 --> 01:11:11,733
Hey!

1101
01:11:13,801 --> 01:11:15,003
[screams]

1102
01:11:34,588 --> 01:11:36,457
Okay.

1103
01:11:40,795 --> 01:11:43,428
[water running]

1104
01:11:43,430 --> 01:11:45,130
[Harold groans]

1105
01:11:45,132 --> 01:11:48,871
Ah, the genius wakes.

1106
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:52,004
[sighs] So...

1107
01:11:52,006 --> 01:11:54,741
riddle me something,
shithead.

1108
01:11:54,743 --> 01:11:59,411
Why does a man run away from
someone who's saved his life?

1109
01:11:59,413 --> 01:12:01,849
Hmm? You don't know?

1110
01:12:03,083 --> 01:12:04,517
All right.

1111
01:12:04,519 --> 01:12:06,021
[sighs]

1112
01:12:07,154 --> 01:12:09,457
Harold, who are these two?

1113
01:12:11,024 --> 01:12:13,692
They are tourists
from the motel.

1114
01:12:13,694 --> 01:12:16,597
Really? You sure?

1115
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:22,869
What about
those two assholes?

1116
01:12:22,871 --> 01:12:25,972
They-They run the motel.

1117
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:27,572
They run the motel?

1118
01:12:27,574 --> 01:12:30,041
- Mm.
- [chuckles]

1119
01:12:30,043 --> 01:12:31,910
[fingers snap]

1120
01:12:31,912 --> 01:12:34,746
You weren't kidnapped,
were you?

1121
01:12:34,748 --> 01:12:36,351
You set this up yourself.

1122
01:12:37,752 --> 01:12:40,719
On the one hand, I am
surprised you had the balls.

1123
01:12:40,721 --> 01:12:42,754
On the other...

1124
01:12:42,756 --> 01:12:45,760
this shit show can only be
the work of a fucking amateur.

1125
01:12:47,529 --> 01:12:50,196
Why'd you do it?
Money?

1126
01:12:50,198 --> 01:12:51,834
Revenge 'cause he was
banging your wife?

1127
01:12:55,470 --> 01:12:57,005
You-You didn't know?

1128
01:12:58,072 --> 01:12:59,574
Ah, shit.

1129
01:13:00,942 --> 01:13:03,045
Try not to take it
too personally.

1130
01:13:07,215 --> 01:13:09,682
I thought he was my friend.

1131
01:13:09,684 --> 01:13:14,486
Remember the, uh, story
about five years ago,

1132
01:13:14,488 --> 01:13:18,825
a woman in Pennsylvania
kept a black bear as a pet.

1133
01:13:18,827 --> 01:13:24,629
She looked after it, fed it. And then
one day, it mauled her, you know?

1134
01:13:24,631 --> 01:13:26,598
She's shocked.

1135
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:28,703
I mean, she-she thought
they were friends.

1136
01:13:31,104 --> 01:13:33,942
But it's a fucking bear,
Harold.

1137
01:13:38,112 --> 01:13:39,047
Yeah.

1138
01:13:41,048 --> 01:13:43,081
We're gonna need
a couple of new passports

1139
01:13:43,083 --> 01:13:47,085
after, uh, that incident
at the airport.

1140
01:13:47,087 --> 01:13:49,992
Who'd you wanna be? I'm gonna
let you choose your own name.

1141
01:13:51,859 --> 01:13:54,093
You're forging passports?

1142
01:13:54,095 --> 01:13:57,996
This is a magic box, my friend.

1143
01:13:57,998 --> 01:14:00,665
I've been 25 different people
in my life,

1144
01:14:00,667 --> 01:14:04,970
and the 200 grand
I'm getting for your ass

1145
01:14:04,972 --> 01:14:07,205
is going right
into my little account

1146
01:14:07,207 --> 01:14:09,040
in the Grand Caymans.

1147
01:14:09,042 --> 01:14:11,643
- Two hundred thousand?
- Yep.

1148
01:14:11,645 --> 01:14:13,081
[scoffs]

1149
01:14:14,282 --> 01:14:16,182
Is that all I'm worth?

1150
01:14:16,184 --> 01:14:19,151
No, no. I was authorized
to go as high as a million.

1151
01:14:19,153 --> 01:14:22,722
Richard's gonna be so happy
that he doesn't have to pay it.

1152
01:14:22,724 --> 01:14:25,290
He's such a greedy fucker.

1153
01:14:25,292 --> 01:14:27,259
So they do know
you have me?

1154
01:14:27,261 --> 01:14:30,095
No, not yet.

1155
01:14:30,097 --> 01:14:33,734
Why would you settle for 200 thousand
when you can make more than double that?

1156
01:14:39,841 --> 01:14:41,109
Oh, Harold.

1157
01:14:42,777 --> 01:14:44,809
You wanna go for the ransom?

1158
01:14:44,811 --> 01:14:48,214
Why not? You've already
done the hard part.

1159
01:14:48,216 --> 01:14:50,616
You have me, you have
the offshore account.

1160
01:14:50,618 --> 01:14:51,851
Look at me.

1161
01:14:51,853 --> 01:14:54,219
I have no job to go
back to, no wife.

1162
01:14:54,221 --> 01:14:56,821
Why do you think I ran?
I cannot go back to Chicago.

1163
01:14:56,823 --> 01:14:58,926
My life there
has been a complete lie.

1164
01:14:59,993 --> 01:15:01,760
You're waking up, Harold.

1165
01:15:01,762 --> 01:15:04,632
I like that. [exhales]

1166
01:15:09,170 --> 01:15:11,606
That's a lot of food packs.

1167
01:15:12,873 --> 01:15:14,775
Medical supplies.

1168
01:15:17,712 --> 01:15:19,081
All right. Done.

1169
01:15:20,847 --> 01:15:22,717
You have a deal, my friend.

1170
01:15:24,152 --> 01:15:27,652
But you can forget
about a 50-50 split.

1171
01:15:27,654 --> 01:15:31,790
I could kill you right now, tell
them that you're still alive

1172
01:15:31,792 --> 01:15:33,929
and blow off
with the whole million.

1173
01:15:36,663 --> 01:15:39,201
But I'm not gonna do that,
Harold. I've changed.

1174
01:15:42,270 --> 01:15:44,006
Freedom, huh?

1175
01:15:46,006 --> 01:15:49,674
Eighty-twenty...
'cause I like you.

1176
01:15:49,676 --> 01:15:51,913
You got an underdog thing
going on, Harold.

1177
01:15:52,947 --> 01:15:54,283
Reminds me of the Haitians.

1178
01:16:05,158 --> 01:16:07,660
- What is that?
- It's an injectable microchip.

1179
01:16:07,662 --> 01:16:09,861
- I need to keep track of you.
- I won't run again.

1180
01:16:09,863 --> 01:16:12,397
- I promise I won't run again.
- Harold. Harold, I can't take the chance.

1181
01:16:12,399 --> 01:16:14,366
No, no! Aah!
I don't like needles!

1182
01:16:14,368 --> 01:16:17,102
- Just give me... Look away. Look away.
- No, no, no! No, please!

1183
01:16:17,104 --> 01:16:19,839
- [screaming]
- It's over. It's over.

1184
01:16:19,841 --> 01:16:22,107
- Motherfucker!
- It's over, man. Shit.

1185
01:16:22,109 --> 01:16:24,110
[chattering]

1186
01:16:24,112 --> 01:16:25,844
Elaine,
this is really fun.

1187
01:16:25,846 --> 01:16:27,679
So glad you made that call.

1188
01:16:27,681 --> 01:16:29,348
You called me, Jerry.

1189
01:16:29,350 --> 01:16:31,983
- You're right.
- [chuckles]

1190
01:16:31,985 --> 01:16:33,287
Hey, here's a toast.

1191
01:16:34,921 --> 01:16:36,958
- [clink]
- To Neil Armstrong.

1192
01:16:39,092 --> 01:16:43,262
Yeah, it's been
a great night, Jerry,

1193
01:16:43,264 --> 01:16:47,199
but we should probably start talking
some business, don't you think?

1194
01:16:47,201 --> 01:16:49,805
Oh, let's relax, Elaine.
Business isn't going anywhere.

1195
01:16:51,171 --> 01:16:55,007
I was thinking maybe
we keep it personal tonight.

1196
01:16:55,009 --> 01:16:56,909
[both laughing]

1197
01:16:56,911 --> 01:16:59,344
Dance till the club closes,

1198
01:16:59,346 --> 01:17:00,812
if you catch my meaning.

1199
01:17:00,814 --> 01:17:03,848
[laughs]

1200
01:17:03,850 --> 01:17:05,786
You dirty dog.

1201
01:17:07,454 --> 01:17:09,054
Okay.

1202
01:17:09,056 --> 01:17:10,992
All right, well,
let's have a look at it.

1203
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:14,226
What?

1204
01:17:14,228 --> 01:17:16,832
Let's see what
you're working with.

1205
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,336
I am catching
your meaning, right?

1206
01:17:24,337 --> 01:17:28,273
I'm not gonna... I'm not... I'm not.
I'm not... I'm not...

1207
01:17:28,275 --> 01:17:31,779
Go on, Jerry.
Just toss it against your thigh.

1208
01:17:32,779 --> 01:17:34,181
No one's looking.

1209
01:17:38,086 --> 01:17:41,789
Look, you take that baby out,
and if I like what I see...

1210
01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:45,926
I'll let you take me
home tonight.

1211
01:17:48,296 --> 01:17:53,031
But if I don't think that's up to snuff, then,
well, we start talking business right now.

1212
01:17:53,033 --> 01:17:54,235
What do you say?

1213
01:18:02,743 --> 01:18:04,211
[sighs]

1214
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,784
Let me tell you why
you don't need Richard.

1215
01:18:28,903 --> 01:18:30,803
[Harold]
<i>This is fantastic, Mitch.</i>

1216
01:18:30,805 --> 01:18:33,004
Really impressive.

1217
01:18:33,006 --> 01:18:34,408
Well, it's not
my first rodeo.

1218
01:18:35,777 --> 01:18:37,375
[chiming]

1219
01:18:37,377 --> 01:18:39,344
- Oh.
- It's Richard.

1220
01:18:39,346 --> 01:18:41,981
Get out of the frame.

1221
01:18:41,983 --> 01:18:43,719
Don't say a word.

1222
01:18:50,123 --> 01:18:51,956
Hey. Hey, Rich.

1223
01:18:51,958 --> 01:18:55,928
Uh, listen, man,
extraction's looking iffy.

1224
01:18:55,930 --> 01:18:58,129
I don't want
an extraction anymore.

1225
01:18:58,131 --> 01:19:02,134
Good. Good, 'cause
the deal's the way to go.

1226
01:19:02,136 --> 01:19:05,137
- There's not gonna be a deal either.
- What?

1227
01:19:05,139 --> 01:19:07,272
What do you mean?

1228
01:19:07,274 --> 01:19:11,177
It seems that while we dropped
the kidnap and ransom policy

1229
01:19:11,179 --> 01:19:15,281
there was another policy that we
overlooked: corporate life insurance.

1230
01:19:15,283 --> 01:19:17,219
Overlooked?

1231
01:19:19,153 --> 01:19:22,324
If Harold were to...

1232
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:27,462
end up dead while conducting
business in a foreign country...

1233
01:19:30,163 --> 01:19:33,531
this would pay out five million
dollars to the corporation.

1234
01:19:33,533 --> 01:19:36,036
Hmm. Yeah.

1235
01:19:38,038 --> 01:19:42,508
Yeah, well, that... that's
not a deal I'm willing to do.

1236
01:19:42,510 --> 01:19:45,244
Don't start with any of this, "I'm
not gonna take anyone out for you!"

1237
01:19:45,246 --> 01:19:48,379
Okay, just relax.
Just relax.

1238
01:19:48,381 --> 01:19:53,454
And I will give you one million
reasons to kill this guy.

1239
01:19:56,858 --> 01:19:59,094
[sighs] Really?
One million?

1240
01:20:02,162 --> 01:20:03,330
It's not enough.

1241
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:09,869
- What about two million?
- You fucking pig, Mitch!

1242
01:20:09,871 --> 01:20:12,170
<i>Oh, come on,
it's for a good cause.</i>

1243
01:20:12,172 --> 01:20:14,874
<i>Think of someone other
than yourself for once.</i>

1244
01:20:14,876 --> 01:20:17,179
Just wire the money, shithead,
and you have a deal.

1245
01:20:22,617 --> 01:20:24,916
- Did they double it to two million?
- They did!

1246
01:20:24,918 --> 01:20:26,018
- Great!
- Yeah.

1247
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:27,452
- Great.
- Yeah!

1248
01:20:27,454 --> 01:20:30,024
[laughs]

1249
01:20:32,158 --> 01:20:33,992
- You are very good at that.
- Yeah.

1250
01:20:33,994 --> 01:20:36,061
What do you say we, uh,

No. Harold.

Sure.

All right. Harold, there's
something I have to tell you.

1275
01:22:37,385 --> 01:22:38,653
Uh...

1276
01:22:42,088 --> 01:22:43,490
Richard's my brother.

1277
01:22:45,393 --> 01:22:46,493
Yeah.

1278
01:22:48,662 --> 01:22:51,062
Richard Rusk?

1279
01:22:51,064 --> 01:22:53,634
Yep, unfortunately.

Why... Why have you got that out?
What are you doing?

1283
01:23:06,747 --> 01:23:12,050
It seems Richard's company wants to
claim the insurance policy money.

1284
01:23:12,052 --> 01:23:15,120
No, no. No, no, no. Richard
said they have canceled it.

1285
01:23:15,122 --> 01:23:18,824
- They have canceled the policy.
- No, your life insurance policy, Harold.

1286
01:23:18,826 --> 01:23:21,427
So...

1287
01:23:21,429 --> 01:23:23,695
- But I thought you liked me.
- I do like you.

1288
01:23:23,697 --> 01:23:26,764
No, no, no. But you-you-you said
you liked my whole underdog thing.

1289

- I love your underdog thing.
- So, Mitch, please.

if I sacrificed you, I can help...

You want to sacrifice...

Please, God,
save me from this man.

1298

Please, I beg you. Help me in my
moment of need. Please, Jesus. Please.

1299
01:23:54,295 --> 01:23:56,163
Harold, nobody's coming
in your moment of need.

1300
01:23:57,797 --> 01:23:59,764
You really believe in God?

1301
01:23:59,766 --> 01:24:03,102
Of course I believe in God. What kind
of person does not believe in God?

1302
01:24:03,104 --> 01:24:05,440
Me. I... I don't.

1303
01:24:08,742 --> 01:24:11,809
Well, I mean, I...
I guess I kind of do,

1304
01:24:11,811 --> 01:24:15,580
but not... not in a life-or-death
situation, Harold.

1305
01:24:15,582 --> 01:24:18,784
You know, I... I'm looking for
something, but something more...

1306
01:24:18,786 --> 01:24:22,787
more reliable, you know?

1307
01:24:22,789 --> 01:24:27,192
Yeah, I mean, sure, I tried reading
the Bible a couple of times, but...

1308
01:24:27,194 --> 01:24:30,262
I mean, the Old Testament, Harold.
You can't take that shit seriously.

1309
01:24:30,264 --> 01:24:33,132
And the New Testament, I mean...

1310
01:24:33,134 --> 01:24:36,701
- You take the Bible seriously?
- Of course.

1311
01:24:36,703 --> 01:24:40,138
Really? Like the whole thing
with Peter and Judas.

1312
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:44,776
Remember? So-So Peter
denies Jesus three times.

1313
01:24:44,778 --> 01:24:46,777
Three fucking times, man.

1314
01:24:46,779 --> 01:24:51,215
Now, Judas, on the other hand,
yeah, I mean, he fucked up.

1315
01:24:51,217 --> 01:24:56,287
He sold Jesus out, all right?
But he felt bad about it.

1316
01:24:56,289 --> 01:24:59,758
He hung himself, man!
He felt guilty!

1317
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:04,662
He had a lot more fucking
character than fucking Peter.

1318
01:25:04,664 --> 01:25:07,299
I mean, Peter.

1319
01:25:07,301 --> 01:25:10,501
How do you get behind a religion
that demonizes a guy like Judas

1320
01:25:10,503 --> 01:25:13,240
and makes a saint
out of a guy like Peter?

1322

one was a man
who had a crisis of faith.

1323
01:25:22,582 --> 01:25:25,416
The other one sold his soul
for his own gain.

1324
01:25:25,418 --> 01:25:28,553
So you have to ask yourself,
which one are you?
