~ Guardians of the Tomb (2018) ~
a.k.a. "7 Guardians of the Tomb"
"The Nest" / "Riddle Nest" / "Spider Nest" / "Spiderweb"

2
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,893
[Even though we are fighting,
you're still my big sister.]

3
00:04:30,513 --> 00:04:33,547
- What are you doing here?
- I'm sorry.

4
00:04:33,549 --> 00:04:35,917
I did try to call.

5
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,619
Jia, we need to talk.

6
00:04:37,621 --> 00:04:39,858
I have nothing to say to you.

7
00:04:48,232 --> 00:04:50,432
I didn't ask you in.

8
00:04:50,434 --> 00:04:53,237
It's your brother.
He's missing.

9
00:04:55,438 --> 00:04:58,439
What?
Are you kidding me?

10
00:04:58,441 --> 00:05:00,309
He called from
the research site in China.

11
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:02,177
<i>Were you there too?</i>

12
00:05:02,179 --> 00:05:04,015
<i>What was that?</i>

13
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,482
- <i>Go take a look.</i>
- <i>Ethan!</i>

14
00:05:08,484 --> 00:05:10,485
<i>Whoa!</i>

15
00:05:10,487 --> 00:05:12,220
Luke.

16
00:05:12,222 --> 00:05:13,422
Luke!

17
00:05:19,996 --> 00:05:21,228
I will find Luke.

18
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,999
But I need your help.

19
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:25,968
I have a team on the ground
in China.

20
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,138
We fly out tonight.

21
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,702
Could be in Shanghai
drinking beer.

22
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:46,440
Oh, come on. You should
take pride in your work.

23
00:06:46,442 --> 00:06:49,509
Work? We might as well be
looking for Bigfoot.

24
00:06:49,511 --> 00:06:52,012
Yeah.
That's what makes it fun.

25
00:06:52,014 --> 00:06:56,783
Fun? A wild weekend in Bangkok...
that's fun.

26
00:06:56,785 --> 00:06:58,618
You need to get out more,
mate.

27
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,754
Get my phone.

28
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,522
Righto.

29
00:07:05,524 --> 00:07:06,990
Whoa-ho!

30
00:07:06,992 --> 00:07:08,926
Who's Jia?

31
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,961
Oh, Jesus.

32
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:13,031
She just doesn't give up.

33
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:15,166
Are you nuts?
She's smoking hot.

34
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:16,705
Hey, if you're not interested,
I could...

35
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:19,639
Hey.
She's my sister.

36
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:40,892
The taipan.

37
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:44,127
One of the deadliest reptiles
in the world.

38
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:47,164
They are also
the most aggressive.

39
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:50,834
But I am an expert
in venomous animals,

40
00:07:50,836 --> 00:07:53,605
so if anyone who says

41
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:57,207
the snakes are more afraid of you
then you are of them,

42
00:07:57,209 --> 00:07:59,577
has never met
one of these.

43
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:14,259
One bite can paralyze

44
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:16,894
your entire
central nervous system,

45
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,563
shutting down your major organs

46
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:20,867
and killing you in hours.

47
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:23,767
But don't worry,

48
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:26,869
we can play with this one...

49
00:08:26,871 --> 00:08:28,370
It's fake.

50
00:08:28,372 --> 00:08:30,105
- You want to play?
- Hmm.

51
00:08:31,107 --> 00:08:32,341
Be careful.

52
00:08:32,343 --> 00:08:34,675
It's gonna... bite you!

53
00:08:36,112 --> 00:08:39,581
Don't worry,
I have a little brother too.

54
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:42,918
I bet one day
you'll be just like him.

55
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,922
He's a super-brave adventurer.

56
00:08:50,392 --> 00:08:52,426
<i>The rosy periwinkle...</i>

57
00:08:52,428 --> 00:08:54,361
<i>long rumored
in its native Madagascar</i>

58
00:08:54,363 --> 00:08:56,296
<i>for precious healing powers.</i>

59
00:08:56,298 --> 00:08:58,706
Nobody else believed it,
but our investors took a risk.

60
00:08:59,207 --> 00:09:02,435
Together we've saved the lives
of over 12 million children

61
00:09:02,437 --> 00:09:05,472
who would have otherwise
died of lymphocytic leukemia.

62
00:09:05,474 --> 00:09:09,108
That, and it's the best
investment they ever made.

63
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,812
This is all very educational,
Dr. Kitteridge,

64
00:09:11,814 --> 00:09:14,014
but if you want us to commit,
we need details.

65
00:09:14,016 --> 00:09:15,848
And you'll have them.

66
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,785
We have a team in the field
due to report back any minute.

67
00:09:18,787 --> 00:09:22,856
Gentlemen, I have a reputation
for achieving the impossible.

68
00:09:22,858 --> 00:09:24,993
I'd like you to trust that.

69
00:09:29,498 --> 00:09:31,497
Thanks for coming.

70
00:09:31,499 --> 00:09:33,900
Lisa, will you please
see our friends out?

71
00:09:33,902 --> 00:09:35,171
It'll be my pleasure.

72
00:09:39,809 --> 00:09:42,775
- <i>So, are you flying out tonight?</i>
- <i>No, in fact, tomorrow.</i>

73
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:48,981
- There's other investors.
- Mason, we're almost broke.

74
00:09:48,983 --> 00:09:51,018
- We need money.
- I know.

75
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,187
- I'll get it.
- When?

76
00:09:53,189 --> 00:09:55,087
Every big pharma company
on the planet

77
00:09:55,089 --> 00:09:56,523
is looking for a breakthrough,

78
00:09:56,525 --> 00:09:57,927
and you've got guys
chasing a fairy tale.

79
00:10:02,397 --> 00:10:04,166
It's not a fairy tale.

80
00:10:08,195 --> 00:10:11,139
I better myself before, Andrew.
I'm willing to do it again.

81
00:10:15,204 --> 00:10:18,108
We're on the cusp of something
no one has ever seen before.

82
00:10:20,844 --> 00:10:22,710
Something that would
bring Biotech back

83
00:10:22,712 --> 00:10:26,048
as a leader in life extension
pharmaceuticals.

84
00:10:41,053 --> 00:10:43,256
Here. Let's have a look.

85
00:10:48,695 --> 00:10:50,895
You sure this is the place?

86
00:10:53,332 --> 00:10:55,800
Here is where the locals
put the last sighting.

87
00:10:55,802 --> 00:10:58,069
The northern edge.

88
00:10:58,071 --> 00:11:00,438
Man,
it smells like someone died.

89
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,676
What the hell's that?

90
00:11:07,681 --> 00:11:10,214
Gas build-up from
the old mine, I bet.

91
00:11:10,216 --> 00:11:13,253
Probably methane mixed
with hydrogen sulfide.

92
00:11:15,321 --> 00:11:17,957
It's only dangerous
if you strike a match.

93
00:11:22,729 --> 00:11:25,729
Wasting your time.

94
00:11:25,731 --> 00:11:27,397
The sooner we look around,

95
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:29,800
the sooner you'll get your beer.

96
00:11:29,802 --> 00:11:31,071
Aaah!

97
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,407
Luke! Luke!

98
00:11:37,409 --> 00:11:39,743
Luke, talk to me!
You okay?

99
00:11:43,015 --> 00:11:45,852
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- What the hell's going on?

100
00:11:47,886 --> 00:11:49,155
Answer!

101
00:11:56,162 --> 00:11:57,697
Luke!

102
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,171
- Aaah!
- What?

103
00:12:08,173 --> 00:12:09,709
What is it?

104
00:12:18,918 --> 00:12:20,984
Luke, you're freaking me out,
man. Say something.

105
00:12:20,986 --> 00:12:23,153
I can't believe it.

106
00:12:23,155 --> 00:12:24,855
Ethan, get down here!

107
00:12:24,857 --> 00:12:27,860
- What? No way!
- Now, Ethan.

108
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:39,337
<i>I have
air transport waiting in Beijing</i>

109
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:41,906
<i>to take us to the rescue camp.</i>

110
00:12:41,908 --> 00:12:44,842
<i>I'm... so sorry, Jia.</i>

111
00:12:44,844 --> 00:12:47,781
<i>Especially after
what happened to your parents.</i>

112
00:12:57,023 --> 00:12:58,955
<i>Authorities have confirmed</i>

113
00:12:58,957 --> 00:13:00,858
<i>they've found the wreckage
of a light plane</i>

114
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,526
<i>which disappeared
from radar screens</i>

115
00:13:02,528 --> 00:13:05,329
<i>over three weeks ago
near the northern border.</i>

116
00:13:05,331 --> 00:13:08,299
<i>It is believed to be
the plane of Biotech CEO</i>

117
00:13:08,301 --> 00:13:11,035
<i>John Lee,
and his wife Catherine Lee.</i>

118
00:13:11,037 --> 00:13:13,805
You come to my house...
my parents' house...

119
00:13:13,807 --> 00:13:15,573
and you tell me the same thing
that happened to my parents

120
00:13:15,575 --> 00:13:17,141
has happened to my brother.

121
00:13:17,143 --> 00:13:18,475
It's not the same.
He's alive.

122
00:13:18,477 --> 00:13:20,044
- I know he is.
- Shut up.

123
00:13:20,046 --> 00:13:22,280
You were my father's partner.

124
00:13:22,282 --> 00:13:25,081
<i>You're nothing to me.</i>

125
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:28,252
<i>Lee, who founded the
Biotech pharmaceuticals empire</i>

126
00:13:28,254 --> 00:13:31,855
<i>with Dr. Mason Kitteridge,
was 52 years old.</i>

127
00:13:31,857 --> 00:13:33,860
<i>They leave behind
two young children.</i>

128
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,600
Hi Jia, I'm now at the airport.

129
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,100
Er, what we talked the other day,

130
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,000
don't let that bother you.

131
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,900
<i>Because, I'm not a kid anymore.</i>

132
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,700
Don't worry about me.

133
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
I'll keep that in mind.

134
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,000
Luke!

135
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,538
Jia...

136
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,500
Luke!

137
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,700
Sister!

138
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,177
Oh, don't land there.

139
00:15:15,523 --> 00:15:18,994
Got all the room in the world,
and lands beside the car.

140
00:15:23,096 --> 00:15:24,265
Watch your head.

141
00:15:30,502 --> 00:15:33,272
- Looks like a big one, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

142
00:15:43,081 --> 00:15:46,181
Jia, this is Chen Xhu,
our archeologist.

143
00:15:46,183 --> 00:15:47,249
- Hi.
- Hi.

144
00:15:47,251 --> 00:15:49,120
- Milly Piper. Logistics.
- Milly.

145
00:15:50,522 --> 00:15:52,354
So, she's your consultant, huh?

146
00:15:52,356 --> 00:15:54,690
Consultant on what, exactly?

147
00:15:54,692 --> 00:15:57,160
It's need-to-know only.
You don't need to know.

148
00:15:57,162 --> 00:16:01,196
Oh, well, that cleared
everything right the hell up.

149
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:02,531
Earlier today
we picked up a signal.

150
00:16:02,533 --> 00:16:04,300
It's patchy,
but it could be

151
00:16:04,302 --> 00:16:06,268
a real-time beep
from Luke's GPS.

152
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,338
But, we have a problem.

153
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:11,107
It started about eight hours ago
out of the Gobi Desert.

154
00:16:11,109 --> 00:16:12,342
This one's a monster.

155
00:16:12,344 --> 00:16:14,142
Surface winds
at about 20 knots,

156
00:16:14,144 --> 00:16:16,212
the pressure dropped,
the speed started picking up.

157
00:16:16,214 --> 00:16:19,648
- What's that?
- The last coordinates of Luke and Ethan.

158
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:21,316
And the signal's still moving.

159
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:23,319
It'll be a category 4
dust storm

160
00:16:23,321 --> 00:16:25,257
by the time
it hits this valley.

161
00:16:31,428 --> 00:16:33,595
We'll be looking
for a needle in a haystack.

162
00:16:33,597 --> 00:16:35,765
- How long?
- Hard to know.

163
00:16:35,767 --> 00:16:38,568
With the air this dry,
the storm could hit

164
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,335
any time in the next 24 hours.

165
00:16:40,337 --> 00:16:42,070
We got two choices.

166
00:16:42,072 --> 00:16:45,208
We wait, we lose
whatever life's left on the GPS.

167
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,142
We go,
and we get caught in this,

168
00:16:47,144 --> 00:16:48,643
then I'm putting
all your lives at risk.

169
00:16:48,645 --> 00:16:50,345
Where did you come from?

170
00:16:50,347 --> 00:16:52,047
This is our search
and rescue specialist,

171
00:16:52,049 --> 00:16:53,348
Jack Ridley.

172
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,251
Jack, thanks for coming.
Good to see ya.

173
00:16:55,253 --> 00:16:57,020
Dr. Jia Lee.
One of the men

174
00:16:57,022 --> 00:16:58,720
we're looking for
is her brother.

175
00:16:58,722 --> 00:17:00,192
You serious?

176
00:17:02,027 --> 00:17:04,493
- Can I just explain something?
- Emotion clouds judgment,

177
00:17:04,495 --> 00:17:07,262
and bad judgment
is how people end up dead.

178
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,750
Maybe you are right.

179
00:17:09,147 --> 00:17:10,747
- Oh, oh, uh.
- Okay.

180
00:17:11,204 --> 00:17:12,204
Not okay!

181
00:17:12,841 --> 00:17:14,341
Who do you think you are?

182
00:17:14,543 --> 00:17:15,743
You don't know me.

183
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,083
I don't need anybody's permission
to be here.

184
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:22,005
Especially someone who rides a Harley
and hasn't shaved for a week.

185
00:17:24,355 --> 00:17:25,355
Two days.

186
00:17:26,138 --> 00:17:29,881
And that is a Royal Enfield.
Not a Harley.

187
00:17:30,065 --> 00:17:31,866
Actually, I asked her
to join us.

188
00:17:31,868 --> 00:17:34,135
She has skills that could
be very helpful to us.

189
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:35,870
All right.
Have it your way.

190
00:17:35,872 --> 00:17:39,005
But you do what I say...
when I say it.

191
00:17:39,007 --> 00:17:40,109
Deal?

192
00:17:44,214 --> 00:17:45,214
Okay.

193
00:17:45,517 --> 00:17:48,082
Now, we have a four-hour drive
into the mountains,

194
00:17:48,084 --> 00:17:50,016
and that is a long way,

195
00:17:50,018 --> 00:17:52,119
especially with the dust storm
breathing down our ass.

196
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,600
? A know-it-all. ?

197
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,500
? I also speak Chinese. ?

198
00:17:56,592 --> 00:17:57,592
Let's go!

199
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,800
Hah.

200
00:18:03,632 --> 00:18:05,433
You know
that's bad for you.

201
00:18:05,435 --> 00:18:07,968
Eh, not if you
only eat ten a day.

202
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,938
Hey, Jack.
I want to put my bag back there.

203
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,439
Jia, go ahead.

204
00:18:12,441 --> 00:18:14,274
All right.

205
00:18:14,276 --> 00:18:16,611
- Do you know him?
- Ridley?

206
00:18:16,613 --> 00:18:19,380
He came here
about two years ago,

207
00:18:19,382 --> 00:18:22,949
after his last rescue mission
in Nepal.

208
00:18:22,951 --> 00:18:24,518
The boy wonder.

209
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,222
Used to be a first-responder
for International Rescue.

210
00:18:28,224 --> 00:18:30,223
They had him set
to run emergency response

211
00:18:30,225 --> 00:18:31,358
back in New York.

212
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,126
What's he doing here?

213
00:18:33,128 --> 00:18:35,363
Something bad went down
on his watch.

214
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:37,601
He won't talk about it.

215
00:18:40,002 --> 00:18:42,239
Though I wouldn't mind
trying to get him to.

216
00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:49,974
Pack that on this side.

217
00:18:49,976 --> 00:18:51,242
I'm in the back?

218
00:18:51,244 --> 00:18:53,279
Come on.

219
00:18:53,281 --> 00:18:55,981
What am I, the dog?

220
00:18:55,983 --> 00:18:58,083
Don't answer that.

221
00:19:02,022 --> 00:19:04,123
Got everything you need?

222
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,195
All right.

223
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:17,670
You all right
back there?

224
00:19:17,672 --> 00:19:20,506
The storm's closing in
on the south ridge at 20 knots.

225
00:19:20,508 --> 00:19:21,841
Come on, Gary,
let's go.

226
00:19:21,843 --> 00:19:23,878
Otherwise we're gonna
lose the signal.

227
00:19:43,761 --> 00:19:45,527
<i>It's so barren.</i>

228
00:19:46,329 --> 00:19:47,595
It's amazing, isn't it?

229
00:19:48,597 --> 00:19:52,135
How nature always finds a way
to survive.

230
00:20:10,381 --> 00:20:12,414
The storm's holding for now,

231
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,853
but, the signal's getting weaker.

232
00:20:33,201 --> 00:20:35,733
There's gonna be
a lot of electrical discharge.

233
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,803
We need to stay ahead
of this monster.

234
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:41,108
Not far now.

235
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:42,559
Look out!

236
00:20:45,879 --> 00:20:47,078
What are they?

237
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,313
Keep an eye
on that storm.

238
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:51,084
Okay, got it.

239
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:58,256
What's that smell?

240
00:20:58,258 --> 00:20:59,591
Hydrogen sulfide.

241
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:01,758
This area is dotted
with old coal mines.

242
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,495
Gas is probably escaping
from underground.

243
00:21:11,197 --> 00:21:13,697
- Ohh!
- Jeez.

244
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:17,768
There's nothing inside,

245
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,972
but there's puncture wounds
all over the body.

246
00:21:19,974 --> 00:21:22,974
Looks like
some kind of bite.

247
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,891
Nah?

248
00:21:42,893 --> 00:21:44,726
Don't know what you're missing.

249
00:21:44,728 --> 00:21:46,797
Type 2 diabetes.

250
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:52,133
- Oh, my God. Jack!
- Yeah?

251
00:21:52,135 --> 00:21:53,869
- My God.
- I can see it.

252
00:21:53,871 --> 00:21:56,638
- Look at the size of it!
- Get to the jeep!

253
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,773
To the jeep! Jia!

254
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,211
We have to go!

255
00:22:03,213 --> 00:22:04,912
Get in!

256
00:22:04,914 --> 00:22:06,116
Go on, Gary!

257
00:22:09,185 --> 00:22:10,919
- What's happening?
- It's a firestorm

258
00:22:10,921 --> 00:22:13,622
from the coal mine.
It only takes a spark.

259
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:16,491
You hit a gas pocket
in the wrong place...

260
00:22:16,493 --> 00:22:18,994
- boom! Fourth of July.
- Go, Gary!

261
00:22:18,996 --> 00:22:21,697
- Come on, let's go!
- The wheels are just spinning!

262
00:22:21,699 --> 00:22:22,930
Drive. Drive!

263
00:22:22,932 --> 00:22:25,801
Chen, get out!

264
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:27,268
Gary, get out here!

265
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,873
I'm the driver.
Why am I pushing?

266
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:34,045
Push! Push!

267
00:22:37,581 --> 00:22:40,148
- Okay!
- Gary, let's go!

268
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,517
- Get in!
- Hurry up!

269
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:44,823
- Move! Move!
- Drive, Jia!

270
00:22:49,956 --> 00:22:51,824
Why is she driving?

271
00:22:53,626 --> 00:22:54,537
Where do I go?

272
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,293
There's an abandoned mine
less than a mile ahead.

273
00:22:57,295 --> 00:22:59,363
There may still be buildings
there we can shelter in.

274
00:22:59,365 --> 00:23:01,164
If they're still standing.

275
00:23:01,166 --> 00:23:02,665
Good luck
finding 'em in this.

276
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:04,201
Be careful.

277
00:23:04,203 --> 00:23:05,305
Get back on the road!

278
00:23:18,447 --> 00:23:20,316
It's a monster.

279
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,129
We're never gonna make it.

280
00:23:40,433 --> 00:23:42,335
The rocks!

281
00:23:45,538 --> 00:23:49,875
Go, go, go!

282
00:23:49,877 --> 00:23:51,877
Mason, go!

283
00:23:51,879 --> 00:23:54,178
Gary, get into the house!

284
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,647
Come on!

285
00:23:57,649 --> 00:24:00,850
Milly, come on!

286
00:24:00,852 --> 00:24:01,918
Everyone inside!

287
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,320
Aaah!

288
00:24:07,692 --> 00:24:09,561
Get the curtains
off the windows.

289
00:24:12,297 --> 00:24:13,699
Shut those windows.

290
00:24:19,699 --> 00:24:22,667
- Ow.
- Anybody here?

291
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:26,070
Jia. Here, take this.

292
00:24:26,072 --> 00:24:27,406
Drink slowly.

293
00:24:27,408 --> 00:24:29,508
- Hello!
- Hello, anyone here?

294
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,243
Good.

295
00:24:31,245 --> 00:24:33,180
You do what I say
when I say it.

296
00:24:37,318 --> 00:24:39,087
Got you.

297
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,188
Thanks.

298
00:24:48,259 --> 00:24:50,026
Is that thing sanitized?

299
00:24:50,028 --> 00:24:51,996
Don't be a baby.

300
00:24:56,969 --> 00:24:58,802
Never should have come.

301
00:24:58,804 --> 00:25:02,171
Now eight us will die out
here, instead of two.

302
00:25:02,173 --> 00:25:04,174
You knew what you were
getting into, huh?

303
00:25:04,176 --> 00:25:05,843
Everybody listen to me.

304
00:25:06,845 --> 00:25:09,702
With a burn this intense,
the radiant heat will kill us

305
00:25:09,705 --> 00:25:11,080
way before any flame does.

306
00:25:11,482 --> 00:25:13,149
There must be something
underground.

307
00:25:13,151 --> 00:25:16,254
A storm cellar.
Let me take a look.

308
00:25:18,287 --> 00:25:19,920
What about Luke and Ethan?

309
00:25:19,922 --> 00:25:21,823
They're on their own
until the storm passes.

310
00:25:21,825 --> 00:25:24,892
Right now we need
to take care of ourselves.

311
00:25:24,894 --> 00:25:26,762
So for now,
this rescue mission's over.

312
00:25:26,764 --> 00:25:28,229
Is that a fact?

313
00:25:29,031 --> 00:25:32,903
The mission might be over
for you, but not for me.

314
00:25:35,939 --> 00:25:37,872
Ridley, there's something here.

315
00:25:37,874 --> 00:25:38,942
Mason.

316
00:25:45,247 --> 00:25:47,383
Why haven't we
seen any people?

317
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:06,600
Mason.

318
00:26:06,602 --> 00:26:08,268
I know it's not my place,

319
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:11,071
but what was Luke looking for?

320
00:26:11,073 --> 00:26:13,310
You're right.
It's not your place.

321
00:26:50,299 --> 00:26:52,198
What?

322
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,403
I was just trying
to comfort you.

323
00:27:01,643 --> 00:27:04,312
I should...
I should go with her.

324
00:27:04,314 --> 00:27:07,985
Just to, um...
just to keep her safe.

325
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:12,918
Oh.

326
00:29:15,371 --> 00:29:16,371
Oh my dearl...

327
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:19,399
why are you hiding in here?

328
00:29:21,913 --> 00:29:22,913
Just you?

329
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,510
Put down the knife.

330
00:29:27,514 --> 00:29:28,647
I won't hurt you.

331
00:29:29,597 --> 00:29:30,797
What is your name?

332
00:29:35,124 --> 00:29:36,560
Yin.

333
00:29:37,161 --> 00:29:38,694
What about your family?

334
00:29:42,689 --> 00:29:44,056
<i>It's very dangerous here.</i>

335
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,448
Come out here quick.

336
00:29:46,543 --> 00:29:47,243
Quick!

337
00:29:47,347 --> 00:29:48,547
It's about to catch fire here.

338
00:29:49,169 --> 00:29:50,169
Move quickly!

339
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:54,611
Chen.

340
00:29:56,081 --> 00:29:57,081
Hello.

341
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:07,088
You okay?

342
00:30:35,082 --> 00:30:36,082
Chen,

343
00:30:37,308 --> 00:30:40,254
we better get out of here.
Now.

344
00:30:40,256 --> 00:30:43,258
Now! Let's go! Trust me!

345
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:49,763
Chen.
We gotta go, right now.

346
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:52,134
Come on.
Come on, trust me.

347
00:30:58,207 --> 00:30:59,273
Huh?!

348
00:30:59,275 --> 00:31:00,674
- Aaah!
- Chen!

349
00:31:02,476 --> 00:31:03,543
Let's get out of here!
<i>Come on!</i>

350
00:31:03,545 --> 00:31:06,412
<i>Come on, I've got you!
Let's go! Let's go!</i>

351
00:31:06,414 --> 00:31:07,412
What happened?

352
00:31:07,414 --> 00:31:09,050
- Jia!
- Chen.

353
00:31:13,052 --> 00:31:14,319
Is everything all right?

354
00:31:14,321 --> 00:31:15,491
What happened?

355
00:31:17,158 --> 00:31:18,958
This is a funnel-web bite.

356
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,195
As in funnel-web... spiders?

357
00:31:21,397 --> 00:31:23,496
As in funnel-web <i>giraffe</i>.

358
00:31:23,498 --> 00:31:26,298
You could be wrong.
It's not like you're an expert.

359
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,066
Actually, she is.

360
00:31:28,068 --> 00:31:29,969
I don't like spiders, okay?

361
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:34,207
Wait. Funnel-webs are only found
in Australia.

362
00:31:34,209 --> 00:31:36,441
What are they doing here?

363
00:31:39,513 --> 00:31:41,480
Chen. Breathe slow.

364
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:44,817
Panic only pumps the poison
faster through your blood.

365
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:47,953
You are a first-responder,
right? So respond.

366
00:31:47,955 --> 00:31:49,989
You know the pressure
immobilization technique?

367
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,794
- Of course.
- Do it.

368
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,161
It's ineffective
with a torso bite.

369
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,866
Jia, no!

370
00:32:02,468 --> 00:32:03,268
Aah!

371
00:32:06,006 --> 00:32:07,639
Let me lean you up, okay?

372
00:32:07,641 --> 00:32:09,674
We need to keep you elevated.

373
00:32:09,676 --> 00:32:10,774
His pulse is dropping.

374
00:32:12,312 --> 00:32:13,548
Open the door!

375
00:32:18,384 --> 00:32:20,517
- How's he doing?
- Not good.

376
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:23,391
Jack, out back there's
a storeroom with a trap door.

377
00:32:24,591 --> 00:32:25,823
Gary, come here.
Show me.

378
00:32:25,825 --> 00:32:27,524
Watch Chen.

379
00:32:27,526 --> 00:32:28,827
We got five minutes max

380
00:32:28,829 --> 00:32:30,361
before this place goes up
in flames.

381
00:32:30,363 --> 00:32:31,929
You'll be all right, Chen.

382
00:32:31,931 --> 00:32:33,534
Hang in there, mate.

383
00:32:40,241 --> 00:32:41,277
You're gonna be okay,
buddy.

384
00:32:42,345 --> 00:32:44,010
This is gonna make you sick.

385
00:32:45,012 --> 00:32:46,347
So sick you want to die.

386
00:32:46,743 --> 00:32:49,625
That's the anti-venom
fighting the poison in your blood.

387
00:32:53,253 --> 00:32:55,688
Aaaah!

388
00:33:01,124 --> 00:33:02,124
It's locked.

389
00:33:04,093 --> 00:33:06,930
We gotta get it open.
Look for something.

390
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:13,902
- The storm's getting closer.
- I know.

391
00:33:13,904 --> 00:33:16,137
If you and I survive this,
we should get a drink.

392
00:33:16,139 --> 00:33:18,906
Fertilizer, fuel oil...

393
00:33:18,908 --> 00:33:21,012
Not the kind of cocktail
I have in mind.

394
00:33:28,717 --> 00:33:30,816
What's happening?
Why isn't it working?

395
00:33:30,818 --> 00:33:31,950
But that doesn't make any sense.

396
00:33:31,952 --> 00:33:33,419
I gave him enough.

397
00:33:33,421 --> 00:33:34,720
A double dose would kill him.

398
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:35,991
He's already dying.

399
00:33:51,604 --> 00:33:54,341
Aaaah!

400
00:34:02,315 --> 00:34:03,482
We're running out of time.

401
00:34:07,052 --> 00:34:09,488
All right.
Can you lift that up for me?

402
00:34:13,158 --> 00:34:14,293
You should run now.

403
00:34:17,029 --> 00:34:18,131
Very creative.

404
00:34:18,134 --> 00:34:18,964
- Go!
- Oh.

405
00:34:20,764 --> 00:34:21,724
It's gonna blow!

406
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:27,570
Aah!

407
00:34:30,342 --> 00:34:32,208
- What the hell was that?!
- We have a way out.

408
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:33,313
Get Chen up.

409
00:34:34,412 --> 00:34:35,402
- Yin!
- Gotta hurry!

410
00:34:35,404 --> 00:34:37,127
Yin, come back!

411
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:38,689
- Come back!
- Yin!

412
00:34:42,555 --> 00:34:43,355
Let's go!

413
00:34:44,043 --> 00:34:44,843
Come on!

414
00:34:48,794 --> 00:34:52,297
We're all safe.
We're all safe.

415
00:34:53,632 --> 00:34:56,365
Come here.
Up you go.

416
00:34:56,367 --> 00:34:57,569
I got you.

417
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:01,637
Don't touch the line.

418
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:05,274
The funnel-webs
react to vibration in the silk.

419
00:35:05,276 --> 00:35:06,842
To them,
it means feeding time.

420
00:35:06,844 --> 00:35:08,544
Feeding time?

421
00:35:08,546 --> 00:35:10,315
Awesome.

422
00:35:13,218 --> 00:35:14,083
Made it!

423
00:35:14,085 --> 00:35:15,918
Ah, I don't think
this is a very good plan.

424
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,923
- Come on!
- Go!

425
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:21,524
Roof ain't gonna hold
much longer.

426
00:35:21,526 --> 00:35:22,592
Relax. I'm coming.

427
00:35:23,075 --> 00:35:23,942
I don't want to go.

428
00:35:24,304 --> 00:35:25,643
Don't be afraid. Just follow me.

429
00:35:25,746 --> 00:35:26,663
- I'll go first.
- Come on!

430
00:35:26,665 --> 00:35:28,901
- Just follow my lead.
- Everybody's gonna be okay.

431
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,172
I got you. Good girl.

432
00:35:36,174 --> 00:35:37,974
Everyone spread out.

433
00:35:37,976 --> 00:35:39,579
Mason! Milly! Hurry.

434
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:42,712
Come this way.

435
00:35:43,314 --> 00:35:44,214
Come on.

436
00:35:47,751 --> 00:35:48,854
<i>Be careful.</i>

437
00:35:52,357 --> 00:35:54,694
- <i>Move it!</i>
- Aaah!

438
00:35:56,695 --> 00:35:58,762
Milly, watch out!

439
00:35:58,764 --> 00:36:00,329
Ohh! Ow!

440
00:36:01,731 --> 00:36:02,565
Milly!

441
00:36:03,567 --> 00:36:04,702
They kill you
in the walls!

442
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:05,902
Milly, watch out!

443
00:36:06,804 --> 00:36:08,405
Milly!

444
00:36:08,407 --> 00:36:11,340
Ohh! Aaah!

445
00:36:15,414 --> 00:36:17,147
Aah! Milly,
get away from the wall!

446
00:36:17,149 --> 00:36:19,049
I got you! Come on!

447
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,887
- Guys! On the stairs.
- I see 'em! I see 'em!

448
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,256
- Ridley!
- I see it.

449
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:32,928
Aaaah!

450
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:33,932
I hate spiders!

451
00:36:44,842 --> 00:36:46,312
Is everyone all right?

452
00:36:49,381 --> 00:36:52,147
What is this place?

453
00:36:52,149 --> 00:36:54,017
Looks like a cave system.

454
00:36:54,019 --> 00:36:57,890
No, it looks like a place
where spiders come from.

455
00:36:59,356 --> 00:37:00,195
Milly...

456
00:37:01,298 --> 00:37:02,659
Where's my pack?

457
00:37:03,061 --> 00:37:05,361
Do you have a tourniquet
in there?

458
00:37:05,363 --> 00:37:08,200
- Stay down.
- Wrap this around here.

459
00:37:14,238 --> 00:37:15,771
There were six vials.

460
00:37:15,773 --> 00:37:18,140
Two broke,
and two were used.

461
00:37:18,142 --> 00:37:19,345
Where are the others?

462
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,380
How much time does she have?

463
00:37:23,782 --> 00:37:25,180
I don't know.

464
00:37:25,182 --> 00:37:27,984
A single bite causes death
in under 12 hours.

465
00:37:27,986 --> 00:37:30,820
And she's been bitten
three times.

466
00:37:30,822 --> 00:37:32,488
And this venom...

467
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:34,823
is stronger than anything
I've ever seen.

468
00:37:34,825 --> 00:37:37,292
Has anyone else been bitten?

469
00:37:37,294 --> 00:37:39,932
- No.
- Mason. You good?

470
00:37:43,367 --> 00:37:45,334
You knew all along. Didn't you?

471
00:37:45,336 --> 00:37:47,336
Why didn't you say anything?

472
00:37:47,338 --> 00:37:49,041
I had my reasons.

473
00:37:50,908 --> 00:37:52,542
Did you at least tell Luke?

474
00:37:52,544 --> 00:37:53,910
Did you lie to him?

475
00:37:53,912 --> 00:37:56,348
Hey! Save the soap opera
for later.

476
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,917
Ridley, I know
I'm just a driver,

477
00:38:00,919 --> 00:38:03,352
but a bag's not supposed
to do that, right?

478
00:38:03,354 --> 00:38:04,787
Yin! No, wait!

479
00:38:04,789 --> 00:38:06,157
No!

480
00:38:10,861 --> 00:38:13,830
The GPS... it's totaled.

481
00:38:13,832 --> 00:38:15,964
Our rescue mission
just got harder.

482
00:38:15,966 --> 00:38:19,001
Oh, you stupid little...
Look what you've done!

483
00:38:19,353 --> 00:38:21,686
I'm sorry. I thought...

484
00:38:27,979 --> 00:38:29,312
The light was flashing.

485
00:38:29,314 --> 00:38:31,314
That's him. I know it.

486
00:38:32,316 --> 00:38:34,120
Wait.

487
00:38:36,421 --> 00:38:38,521
GPS doesn't work underground.

488
00:38:38,523 --> 00:38:40,423
It can if you boost the signal.

489
00:38:40,425 --> 00:38:42,158
Boost it?

490
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,227
That's how Milly
got a reading before.

491
00:38:45,229 --> 00:38:47,963
You got a strong antenna,
leave it at the entry point,

492
00:38:47,965 --> 00:38:49,832
toss down a few receivers
as you go...

493
00:38:49,834 --> 00:38:51,200
you don't lose your connection.

494
00:38:51,202 --> 00:38:53,102
It's like a trail
of bread crumbs.

495
00:38:53,104 --> 00:38:55,537
Luke found a way in...

496
00:38:55,539 --> 00:38:58,006
and we have a way out.

497
00:38:58,008 --> 00:38:59,341
Come on.

498
00:39:02,546 --> 00:39:05,080
- You good?
- Yeah.

499
00:39:05,082 --> 00:39:08,184
- Mason, help Milly.
- Yeah, yeah.

500
00:39:08,186 --> 00:39:10,352
You got her?
Come on, Milly, we gotcha.

501
00:39:10,354 --> 00:39:12,157
The signal won't last
much longer.

502
00:39:13,858 --> 00:39:16,492
- Jia!
- Come on, guys.

503
00:39:26,171 --> 00:39:29,175
<i>I've sent you some
pictures... check it out.</i>

504
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:33,345
Those two marks.

505
00:39:35,379 --> 00:39:36,879
Are they what
I think they are?

506
00:39:36,881 --> 00:39:39,249
It's too early
to confirm it now.

507
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:41,821
<i>But it's a spider bite
for sure.</i>

508
00:39:42,988 --> 00:39:44,823
Ahh.

509
00:40:33,454 --> 00:40:36,225
- Need a breather?
- Yeah.

510
00:40:37,992 --> 00:40:42,560
Tool marks.
What were they building here?

511
00:40:42,562 --> 00:40:46,364
There's a legend
of an underground tomb

512
00:40:46,366 --> 00:40:48,403
built over 2,000 years ago.

513
00:40:49,871 --> 00:40:52,238
But it's just a myth.

514
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,043
- Ahh!
- Milly!

515
00:40:58,276 --> 00:40:59,542
I got her.

516
00:40:59,544 --> 00:41:01,481
Let's keep goin'.

517
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,593
Relax, Mason.

518
00:41:18,595 --> 00:41:20,162
I didn't want to call

519
00:41:20,164 --> 00:41:21,729
until I knew what
we were dealing with.

520
00:41:21,731 --> 00:41:24,399
Hold on. Yeah.

521
00:41:24,401 --> 00:41:27,202
Let me get the sat link up.

522
00:41:27,204 --> 00:41:29,303
<i>I've never seen
anything like it.</i>

523
00:41:29,305 --> 00:41:31,106
It's just incredible...

524
00:41:31,108 --> 00:41:32,708
the state of preservation.

525
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:34,309
I'll send you some pictures.
Check it out.

526
00:41:34,711 --> 00:41:37,111
Okay, uploading now.

527
00:41:37,113 --> 00:41:40,649
<i>Our tests
date him from 200 BC.</i>

528
00:41:40,651 --> 00:41:43,417
But there's no sign
of mummification.

529
00:41:43,419 --> 00:41:45,486
<i>There shouldn't be
any flesh on him at all.</i>

530
00:41:45,488 --> 00:41:47,289
Well, that dating
can't be right.

531
00:41:47,291 --> 00:41:49,624
- The CT scans confirm it.
- Yeah.

532
00:41:49,626 --> 00:41:52,260
<i>And now for the news
you've been waiting for.</i>

533
00:41:52,262 --> 00:41:56,164
<i>When this man died,
he was 300 years old.</i>

534
00:41:56,766 --> 00:41:58,135
It's real.

535
00:42:32,732 --> 00:42:34,668
Ridley, over here.

536
00:42:45,044 --> 00:42:46,843
Oh, good.

537
00:42:46,845 --> 00:42:49,782
I was worried there wasn't
gonna be a mass grave.

538
00:42:52,051 --> 00:42:54,654
You'll be okay, Milly.

539
00:42:57,557 --> 00:42:59,223
I'm slowing you down.

540
00:42:59,225 --> 00:43:01,826
No, you're not.

541
00:43:01,828 --> 00:43:03,660
They were slaves.

542
00:43:03,662 --> 00:43:06,596
See how their heads
are bent over their necks?

543
00:43:06,598 --> 00:43:09,165
That's from chaining their heads
to their hands

544
00:43:09,167 --> 00:43:11,167
so they couldn't run.

545
00:43:11,169 --> 00:43:14,004
I think they were buried alive.

546
00:43:19,709 --> 00:43:20,709
Listen to that carefully.

547
00:43:24,154 --> 00:43:26,254
you would hear this sound first,

548
00:43:26,955 --> 00:43:29,955
then, you couldn't hear the birds singing.

549
00:43:31,756 --> 00:43:33,723
She said the sound came first.

550
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:35,593
The birds stopped singing.

551
00:43:35,692 --> 00:43:39,139
Then, scratching sound started to
come from the rooms.

552
00:43:39,139 --> 00:43:41,298
Over the walls and on the floor.

553
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,767
It started in the house.

554
00:43:43,769 --> 00:43:45,472
Scratching in the walls
and the floor.

555
00:43:46,034 --> 00:43:47,829
We fought against them.

556
00:43:48,541 --> 00:43:50,874
But there's just too many of them.

557
00:43:51,143 --> 00:43:53,612
They tried to fight back,
but there were too many.

558
00:43:53,812 --> 00:43:56,428
Then, the people were dead.

559
00:43:57,249 --> 00:43:59,381
Then everyone was gone.

560
00:44:04,228 --> 00:44:05,443
It's starting again.

561
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:08,457
She said it's happening again
right now.

562
00:44:15,434 --> 00:44:17,137
<i>Mason, hang on a second.</i>

563
00:44:19,704 --> 00:44:21,414
- What is it?
- <i>What's going on?</i>

564
00:44:21,416 --> 00:44:23,004
- You hear that too?
- <i>What's happening?</i>

565
00:44:23,009 --> 00:44:24,777
We're gonna take a look.

566
00:44:28,914 --> 00:44:31,747
<i>Say, what was that?</i>

567
00:44:31,749 --> 00:44:33,816
<i>Luke!
Oh, my God!</i>

568
00:44:33,818 --> 00:44:36,553
<i>Get off me!</i>

569
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,994
Can we go now, please?

570
00:44:43,996 --> 00:44:46,963
Milly, let's go.

571
00:44:58,844 --> 00:45:00,246
Let's keep
following this path.

572
00:45:11,423 --> 00:45:12,749
What's it doing?

573
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:15,359
It's acting as if
there is a web there.

574
00:45:16,327 --> 00:45:19,463
Normally, they wait for
their prey to come to them.

575
00:45:19,465 --> 00:45:22,131
They never hunt in packs.

576
00:45:22,133 --> 00:45:25,237
But here, it seems like
they're working together.

577
00:45:29,307 --> 00:45:31,008
Come on,
let's get out of here.

578
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:32,309
Let's go. Follow me.

579
00:46:02,527 --> 00:46:05,097
Watch your step.

580
00:46:38,691 --> 00:46:40,726
The spiders behind us...

581
00:46:41,328 --> 00:46:44,294
They're communicating
with the ones around us!

582
00:46:44,296 --> 00:46:46,663
Do funnel-webs do that?

583
00:46:46,665 --> 00:46:49,366
Well, these ones sure do.

584
00:46:49,368 --> 00:46:52,370
These are 2017 funnel-webs,

585
00:46:52,372 --> 00:46:53,869
probably follow each other
on Twitter.

586
00:46:54,382 --> 00:46:57,136
Actually, Weibo.
They don't have Twitter here.

587
00:46:57,938 --> 00:46:58,938
Huh, my bad.

588
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:02,050
Up there.
Fall behind me.

589
00:47:02,591 --> 00:47:04,091
Stay close.

590
00:47:15,136 --> 00:47:16,603
They're coming! Hurry!

591
00:47:16,605 --> 00:47:20,239
- Mason, help me!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

592
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:24,841
Come on!

593
00:47:25,545 --> 00:47:26,545
Hurry!

594
00:47:26,645 --> 00:47:28,648
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

595
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:40,856
Oh, waiter.
Sorry. I, uh...

596
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:44,027
I, ur... I forgot to order
a river of molten lava.

597
00:47:44,029 --> 00:47:45,913
You aren't helping.

598
00:47:46,333 --> 00:47:47,698
Here, Milly,
just rest here.

599
00:47:47,947 --> 00:47:49,414
There's no way across.

600
00:47:55,203 --> 00:47:58,204
Chen. Look. Gods.

601
00:47:58,606 --> 00:48:00,953
Jia! Mason!

602
00:48:03,309 --> 00:48:05,077
There's no way across.

603
00:48:05,079 --> 00:48:08,382
- <i>Uh...</i>
- I... I didn't mean to do that.

604
00:48:11,717 --> 00:48:13,920
Gary, what'd you do?

605
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,222
It's a bridge.

606
00:48:19,992 --> 00:48:21,390
Gary, you genius.

607
00:48:21,392 --> 00:48:22,392
Good work.

608
00:48:22,394 --> 00:48:23,392
Totally meant to do that.

609
00:48:23,394 --> 00:48:24,695
All right, you're first.

610
00:48:24,697 --> 00:48:26,530
Come on. Hurry.
Mason, you're next.

611
00:48:26,532 --> 00:48:27,533
Okay.

612
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,202
Okay, here we go.

613
00:48:36,706 --> 00:48:40,508
One step at a time.

614
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:44,210
Slowly, Gary.

615
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:45,230
That's it.

616
00:48:46,246 --> 00:48:47,781
Let's go.

617
00:48:51,712 --> 00:48:53,060
<i>I don't want to go.</i>

618
00:48:53,692 --> 00:48:57,363
Yeah, okay.

619
00:49:00,068 --> 00:49:00,868
Gary.

620
00:49:06,378 --> 00:49:07,178
Gary!

621
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,240
- Ah, ar...
- <i>You okay?</i>

622
00:49:11,677 --> 00:49:12,844
Be careful, guys.

623
00:49:12,846 --> 00:49:14,715
Gotta switch it to salads.

624
00:49:21,451 --> 00:49:23,020
- Watch your step.
- Easy now.

625
00:49:27,855 --> 00:49:28,920
Good job, you guys.

626
00:49:28,922 --> 00:49:29,922
Come on, we have to go.

627
00:49:29,924 --> 00:49:30,922
Come on, Chen.

628
00:49:32,324 --> 00:49:34,059
- Come on.
- Okay.

629
00:49:34,061 --> 00:49:36,864
- Over here.
- Come on, nice and easy.

630
00:49:42,869 --> 00:49:43,867
Hang on!

631
00:49:45,669 --> 00:49:47,069
- I got you!
- Arr!

632
00:49:47,071 --> 00:49:48,705
Come on! Milly!

633
00:49:48,707 --> 00:49:49,805
It's not gonna hold
much longer.

634
00:49:49,807 --> 00:49:51,841
I got her.

635
00:49:51,843 --> 00:49:54,511
Hurry, Ridley!
The bridge!

636
00:49:56,113 --> 00:49:57,779
- Guys, hurry up!
- We have to go!

637
00:49:57,781 --> 00:49:59,582
- Guys!
- Find him.

638
00:49:59,984 --> 00:50:01,017
Find your brother.

639
00:50:01,019 --> 00:50:02,852
<i>Quickly. Hurry up!
Quickly!</i>

640
00:50:04,855 --> 00:50:05,455
<i>Jump!</i>

641
00:50:05,724 --> 00:50:06,724
Jump!

642
00:50:11,761 --> 00:50:13,127
We got you!

643
00:50:13,329 --> 00:50:15,098
Come on.

644
00:50:17,835 --> 00:50:19,300
Oh, my God, Milly.

645
00:50:32,249 --> 00:50:34,819
- We have to help her.
- There's no way back.

646
00:50:37,019 --> 00:50:38,021
Milly!

647
00:50:50,833 --> 00:50:52,267
She's gone.

648
00:50:52,269 --> 00:50:54,205
We gotta keep going.

649
00:50:55,271 --> 00:50:56,974
Come on, Jia.

650
00:51:16,525 --> 00:51:17,850
What is this place?

651
00:51:17,853 --> 00:51:20,431
Like an old... armory.
A barracks.

652
00:51:26,298 --> 00:51:27,767
Take this.

653
00:51:40,574 --> 00:51:42,276
Good work, Ridley.

654
00:51:44,244 --> 00:51:45,044
That smell,

655
00:51:47,197 --> 00:51:47,997
what is that?

656
00:51:48,418 --> 00:51:52,418
Whale oil, used to
light the flames of eternity.

657
00:51:52,883 --> 00:51:54,886
Huh, huh.
Well, it's what I use it for.

658
00:52:08,192 --> 00:52:09,426
Well done, Ridley.

659
00:52:20,145 --> 00:52:21,137
The myth says

660
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:24,913
the underground was built
with traps and secret passages

661
00:52:24,915 --> 00:52:28,199
The passages, to help you
escape from death.

662
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:30,988
Be nice to escape
from death.

663
00:52:55,671 --> 00:52:56,807
What's she doing?

664
00:52:57,354 --> 00:52:59,313
She's scattering
mugwort leaf.

665
00:53:02,318 --> 00:53:05,651
I remember the smell
from when I was a kid.

666
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:08,743
It's a herb used in
ancient Chinese medicine

667
00:53:08,745 --> 00:53:10,078
to resist the Five Poisons.

668
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:14,015
Five Poisons.
Forgot about those.

669
00:53:14,017 --> 00:53:16,419
Spiders taste with their feet.

670
00:53:16,421 --> 00:53:18,821
Maybe there's something in it.

671
00:53:18,823 --> 00:53:21,490
She was the only one
to survive in the house.

672
00:53:27,597 --> 00:53:28,679
We got company.

673
00:53:29,377 --> 00:53:30,560
Back up.

674
00:53:40,642 --> 00:53:42,475
Uh, guys,
I think we should leave.

675
00:53:42,477 --> 00:53:44,312
I think they're
calling their friends.

676
00:53:46,647 --> 00:53:49,739
Never knew an animal
that wasn't afraid of fire.

677
00:53:51,753 --> 00:53:55,354
Come on, come on!
Let's go! Come on!

678
00:54:02,293 --> 00:54:03,293
Uh, Ridley...

679
00:54:03,295 --> 00:54:05,061
Guys, get over here!

680
00:54:05,063 --> 00:54:06,095
Come on, let's go!

681
00:54:22,846 --> 00:54:24,345
Did any get through?

682
00:54:24,347 --> 00:54:25,981
None I can see.

683
00:54:25,983 --> 00:54:28,115
Thought that only happened
in Scooby Doo.

684
00:54:28,117 --> 00:54:29,119
Okay.

685
00:54:33,023 --> 00:54:34,092
This way.

686
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,800
Yin, what's the matter?

687
00:54:58,800 --> 00:54:59,800
Afraid.

688
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,400
Don't be afraid. Come with me.

689
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,400
I don't want to go.

690
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,200
Let me show you something.

691
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:25,200
My parents left me this when they died.

692
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,200
It brings me luck when I'm lost.

693
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,100
Sister!

694
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:45,900
Hold on to it.

695
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,400
Trust me.

696
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:49,900
Will sure lead you out of here.

697
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:52,400
Mm.

698
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:53,600
Let's go.

699
00:56:08,818 --> 00:56:09,987
Come on.

700
00:56:30,537 --> 00:56:33,238
This must really be it.

701
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:35,707
The Emperor's
underground palace.

702
00:56:35,709 --> 00:56:37,612
The myth.

703
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:42,448
<i>You see, The Emperor believed
that life underground</i>

704
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:45,617
would be a continuation
of life in the real world.

705
00:56:45,619 --> 00:56:49,454
So he built an exact replica
of his city

706
00:56:49,456 --> 00:56:51,523
around his burial tomb.

707
00:56:51,525 --> 00:56:55,193
But The Emperor
had a great fear of death.

708
00:56:55,195 --> 00:56:56,580
So under the city

709
00:56:56,583 --> 00:57:00,534
he built a series of tunnels
that only he knew about.

710
00:57:00,535 --> 00:57:04,573
So if death really did find him,
he would escape it.

711
00:57:09,409 --> 00:57:11,492
If this is what I think it is,

712
00:57:11,495 --> 00:57:16,282
we are talking about one of the
greatest archaeological finds, ever.

713
00:57:16,284 --> 00:57:18,653
Glad to be a part of it.

714
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:28,872
This isn't the first time
someone died on your watch,

715
00:57:28,875 --> 00:57:30,267
is it?

716
00:57:39,808 --> 00:57:41,173
Well, look at that.

717
00:57:41,575 --> 00:57:43,445
You're kidding me.

718
00:57:50,184 --> 00:57:51,385
He's close.

719
00:57:54,822 --> 00:57:56,189
Come on, Mason.

720
00:58:20,949 --> 00:58:24,853
Right there with you, buddy.
You look how I feel.

721
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:29,287
They built this 2,000 years ago?

722
00:58:29,289 --> 00:58:31,791
Yes.

723
00:58:31,793 --> 00:58:35,697
That's Wu Fu.
The Emperor's necromancer.

724
00:58:38,865 --> 00:58:42,570
It's a story about The Emperor's
quest for an elixir.

725
00:58:44,639 --> 00:58:47,640
<i>And he made it
Wu Fu's lifelong task</i>

726
00:58:47,642 --> 00:58:48,443
<i>to fulfill it.</i>

727
00:58:51,679 --> 00:58:55,584
<i>To discover the secret
to eternal life.</i>

728
00:58:57,918 --> 00:59:00,485
So Wu Fu traveled the world...

729
00:59:00,487 --> 00:59:03,421
And on a great island
to the south,

730
00:59:03,423 --> 00:59:07,026
he met men, dark as night...

731
00:59:07,028 --> 00:59:11,030
- Aboriginal Australia...
- <i>Yes, giant masted ships</i>

732
00:59:11,032 --> 00:59:13,468
<i>were found etched
in aboriginal cave paintings.</i>

733
00:59:16,604 --> 00:59:19,704
A shaman there
told him of a secret magic.

734
00:59:19,706 --> 00:59:22,707
There was a crawling creature
and that once a year,

735
00:59:22,709 --> 00:59:25,878
the creature's blood
yielded an enzyme...

736
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:28,381
Produced only during
their mating season.

737
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:31,983
The shaman could only make
a few drops of the elixir.

738
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:33,885
So Wu Fu
brought the creatures home

739
00:59:33,887 --> 00:59:37,555
in their thousands
so he could breed them.

740
00:59:37,557 --> 00:59:41,327
Oh, my God.
Genetic engineering.

741
00:59:41,329 --> 00:59:46,731
Don't you see? These spiders
are built only for two things...

742
00:59:46,733 --> 00:59:48,402
Breeding and killing.

743
00:59:57,811 --> 01:00:00,512
Aggression
often goes hand in hand

744
01:00:00,514 --> 01:00:02,682
with the desire to mate...

745
01:00:02,684 --> 01:00:06,686
Wu Fu unintentionally
strengthened their venom,

746
01:00:06,688 --> 01:00:08,688
their aggression.

747
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:10,890
He gave his Emperor
and himself

748
01:00:10,892 --> 01:00:13,793
unnaturally long life...

749
01:00:13,795 --> 01:00:17,530
but he also gave the spider
unnatural power to kill.

750
01:00:17,532 --> 01:00:20,032
That's what you get when you
mess with freaking spiders.

751
01:00:20,034 --> 01:00:22,535
Mason! Give me the GPS!

752
01:00:22,537 --> 01:00:23,905
Stand back!

753
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:28,606
I'm not sharing this.

754
01:00:28,608 --> 01:00:29,909
You do what you can, Jia,
to stop life

755
01:00:29,911 --> 01:00:31,010
from falling through
your fingers,

756
01:00:31,012 --> 01:00:32,110
but you can't.

757
01:00:32,112 --> 01:00:34,412
Back off!

758
01:00:34,414 --> 01:00:38,416
Everything you touch
leaves, runs... dies.

759
01:00:38,418 --> 01:00:41,387
Your parents, your brother...

760
01:00:41,389 --> 01:00:43,722
And now you!

761
01:00:43,724 --> 01:00:45,059
Mason!

762
01:00:46,827 --> 01:00:48,427
You were bitten,
weren't you?

763
01:00:48,429 --> 01:00:51,564
The toxins in your blood
are making you crazy!

764
01:00:51,566 --> 01:00:53,398
I gave you
everything I could, Jia.

765
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,535
All you gave me was hate.

766
01:00:56,537 --> 01:00:58,540
Now go choke on it!

767
01:01:00,007 --> 01:01:02,041
- Mason!
- Mason!

768
01:01:02,043 --> 01:01:04,876
Go to hell!

769
01:01:04,878 --> 01:01:05,878
Mason!

770
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:08,800
It won't budge!

771
01:01:08,883 --> 01:01:10,515
We're gonna have
a hell of a time

772
01:01:10,517 --> 01:01:11,916
getting out of this place
without that GPS.

773
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:13,753
Any ideas?

774
01:01:13,755 --> 01:01:16,689
There are often concealed
secret doors, secret switches...

775
01:01:16,691 --> 01:01:18,823
Where's Gandalf
when you need him?

776
01:01:18,825 --> 01:01:21,827
Look around the chamber.

777
01:01:21,829 --> 01:01:24,028
Gary. Table.

778
01:01:24,030 --> 01:01:25,398
What about it?

779
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,700
Get over here.
Just lift it.

780
01:01:27,702 --> 01:01:29,735
- What are you doing?
- Ready?

781
01:01:32,472 --> 01:01:34,706
What has this guy been eating?

782
01:01:37,708 --> 01:01:39,677
Chen.

783
01:01:40,845 --> 01:01:42,044
Look.

784
01:01:42,046 --> 01:01:43,393
Watch your step.
Come on.

785
01:01:43,396 --> 01:01:45,241
Yeah.
Oh, boy.

786
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:51,550
This spider
has an extra set of legs.

787
01:01:51,557 --> 01:01:52,588
All right, on three.

788
01:01:52,590 --> 01:01:55,959
One...
two...

789
01:01:55,961 --> 01:01:56,994
three.

790
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:06,500
What're you doing?

791
01:02:11,304 --> 01:02:12,503
Put it down.

792
01:02:12,505 --> 01:02:13,637
Please.

793
01:02:41,585 --> 01:02:42,966
That is beautiful.

794
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:43,920
Come on,

795
01:02:43,922 --> 01:02:46,425
we gotta keep moving to
catch up with Mason.

796
01:02:56,599 --> 01:02:57,599
This way.

797
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:11,400
Jia...

798
01:03:15,335 --> 01:03:16,335
Yin,

799
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,500
"It's only as frightful as you think it is."

800
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:23,800
Do you remember that saying?

801
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:25,800
I remember.

802
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:37,800
I'll always be by your side.

803
01:03:56,947 --> 01:03:58,081
What's that?

804
01:03:58,083 --> 01:04:00,250
It's an aqueduct.

805
01:04:00,252 --> 01:04:04,186
Now, thanks to the mines,
as dry as the farmland above.

806
01:04:07,188 --> 01:04:09,826
- Let me see that.
- Yeah.

807
01:04:27,342 --> 01:04:28,909
What is it?

808
01:04:28,911 --> 01:04:30,747
I think we should go back
the other way.

809
01:04:35,884 --> 01:04:37,754
It might lead somewhere.

810
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,000
<i>Everything good?</i>

811
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:21,800
Yes.

812
01:06:26,596 --> 01:06:30,134
Oh! Yes!

813
01:06:33,935 --> 01:06:35,502
Chen!

814
01:06:35,504 --> 01:06:36,570
Jia!

815
01:06:36,572 --> 01:06:37,871
What's happening?

816
01:06:37,873 --> 01:06:39,109
No!

817
01:06:51,855 --> 01:06:53,555
What took you so long?

818
01:06:55,024 --> 01:06:57,625
You mean "Thank you?"

819
01:06:57,627 --> 01:07:00,560
You should be thanking me.

820
01:07:00,562 --> 01:07:03,563
I just cured
your fear of spiders.

821
01:07:03,565 --> 01:07:05,002
Huh?

822
01:07:07,603 --> 01:07:09,038
Thanks.

823
01:07:13,475 --> 01:07:15,909
Hurry!
It's not gonna hold for long!

824
01:07:15,911 --> 01:07:17,480
Go, go! Go in!

825
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:21,900
<i>Hurry! Go on!</i>

826
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:25,300
<i>Hurry up!</i>

827
01:07:28,884 --> 01:07:30,085
<i>Come on!</i>

828
01:07:31,458 --> 01:07:32,258
Come on!

829
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:34,300
Come on, Gary!

830
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:38,300
Gary! Quickly!

831
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:44,338
Come on, Gary!

832
01:07:57,751 --> 01:07:59,883
This place can kiss my ass.

833
01:07:59,885 --> 01:08:01,019
Mine too.

834
01:08:01,021 --> 01:08:02,854
- Let's go.
- Come on.

835
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:18,135
Come on.
Mason has a head start.

836
01:08:18,137 --> 01:08:22,442
Yeah, let's also not forget
that Mason is bat-shit crazy.

837
01:09:08,554 --> 01:09:11,825
I don't think we have to worry
about Ethan anymore.

838
01:09:21,568 --> 01:09:24,438
You know,
I got exactly the same shirt.

839
01:09:26,539 --> 01:09:28,409
What?

840
01:09:39,418 --> 01:09:41,186
That's Luke's.

841
01:09:41,188 --> 01:09:44,488
That's Luke's handwriting.

842
01:09:44,490 --> 01:09:46,825
They have been underground
for several hours.

843
01:09:46,827 --> 01:09:50,427
They found Wu Fu's chamber.

844
01:09:50,429 --> 01:09:54,298
Then the spiders came.

845
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:59,005
The rest is just
coordinates and symbols.

846
01:10:07,479 --> 01:10:11,381
Jia! Wait!

847
01:10:11,383 --> 01:10:13,550
- What is it?
- A flashlight.

848
01:10:13,552 --> 01:10:16,055
Luke.

849
01:10:22,494 --> 01:10:28,201
It's not Luke. Look. The GPS.
Mason's been here.

850
01:10:35,008 --> 01:10:36,474
Here, take this.

851
01:10:36,476 --> 01:10:38,008
Really?

852
01:10:38,010 --> 01:10:41,014
You will be needing it.
Let's go.

853
01:10:54,994 --> 01:10:56,462
This way.
Through here.

854
01:10:59,633 --> 01:11:05,503
Well, smashed by a rock
and totally waterlogged.

855
01:11:05,505 --> 01:11:07,441
See what I can do this time.

856
01:11:16,212 --> 01:11:17,377
Whoa.

857
01:11:17,379 --> 01:11:19,148
This is the way.

858
01:11:21,384 --> 01:11:24,388
Yes, the murals.

859
01:11:31,962 --> 01:11:36,697
Look. The underground aqueduct.
Water. It all makes sense.

860
01:11:36,699 --> 01:11:38,468
Huh.

861
01:11:44,617 --> 01:11:45,883
Jack.

862
01:11:45,885 --> 01:11:48,885
Get out
and move slowly.

863
01:11:48,887 --> 01:11:51,988
Funnel-webs
can survive underwater.

864
01:11:51,990 --> 01:11:53,492
Get out. Now.

865
01:12:07,439 --> 01:12:09,008
Did it bite me?

866
01:12:27,559 --> 01:12:29,959
It didn't bite you.

867
01:12:29,961 --> 01:12:31,522
It's funnel-web's blood.

868
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:35,300
Should come in next...
next...

869
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,000
No rush, just...

870
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:39,600
Just be... next door
when you're ready.

871
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:20,500
<i>Sister!</i>

872
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:23,800
<i>Luke!</i>

873
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:25,800
<i>You okay?</i>

874
01:13:25,789 --> 01:13:30,358
He's gone,
isn't he?

875
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:31,360
Mason was right.

876
01:13:32,731 --> 01:13:34,266
Everything I touch...

877
01:13:40,338 --> 01:13:44,043
"These things we do,
that others may live."

878
01:13:45,811 --> 01:13:49,015
That's the motto for
Search and Rescue.

879
01:13:52,617 --> 01:13:53,686
Two years ago.

880
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:57,156
The man I lost in Nepal.

881
01:14:00,391 --> 01:14:03,661
He was my teammate
and best friend.

882
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:17,740
He slipped.

883
01:14:17,742 --> 01:14:20,142
Busted his ankle.

884
01:14:20,144 --> 01:14:23,479
Before I could get back to him,

885
01:14:23,481 --> 01:14:26,084
there was this
massive aftershock.

886
01:14:32,724 --> 01:14:34,593
That was the last time
I saw him.

887
01:14:39,396 --> 01:14:43,133
Sometimes
you can't save everyone.

888
01:14:43,135 --> 01:14:46,472
The best you can do is try.

889
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Luke!

890
01:14:59,751 --> 01:15:01,686
Thank you.

891
01:15:18,603 --> 01:15:23,109
I promise you,
we're gonna find him.

892
01:15:39,457 --> 01:15:41,794
I think your brother is
showing us the way out of here.

893
01:15:43,962 --> 01:15:47,196
This is the map
of the underground tomb.

894
01:15:47,198 --> 01:15:50,532
And this, this is the symbol
for water.

895
01:15:50,534 --> 01:15:53,769
The Emperor's myth declares
there is an underground aqueduct

896
01:15:53,771 --> 01:15:56,505
around the tomb
so The Emperor could come and go

897
01:15:56,507 --> 01:15:57,773
in the afterlife.

898
01:15:57,775 --> 01:16:00,213
But it would also act as a way out

899
01:16:00,216 --> 01:16:00,977
to the living world

900
01:16:00,979 --> 01:16:03,879
should he escape death.

901
01:16:03,881 --> 01:16:06,215
Tell them about the
pipe thing-o.

902
01:16:06,217 --> 01:16:09,384
If we follow these pipes
into the tomb

903
01:16:09,386 --> 01:16:12,421
and figure out what's north,

904
01:16:12,423 --> 01:16:14,223
we can get out of here.

905
01:16:14,225 --> 01:16:17,293
How good is that? Eh?
We figured it out.

906
01:16:17,295 --> 01:16:19,661
Come on, high-five.

907
01:16:21,832 --> 01:16:22,932
This way.

908
01:16:22,934 --> 01:16:24,467
- Come on, Gary.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

909
01:16:24,469 --> 01:16:26,436
- This way!
- Gary, come on!

910
01:16:26,438 --> 01:16:27,692
I can't wait to see

911
01:16:27,695 --> 01:16:30,266
what you got for us in the
next room, Mr. Wonka.

912
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:39,014
The Emperor's tomb
is through these gates.

913
01:16:39,016 --> 01:16:40,983
Watch out for the lines.

914
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:43,700
Think before you step.

915
01:16:43,985 --> 01:16:44,985
Careful.

916
01:16:45,455 --> 01:16:46,655
Watchout for the spider lines.

917
01:16:47,521 --> 01:16:49,324
Take your time.

918
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:53,500
Watch that one.

919
01:16:58,730 --> 01:17:00,010
Watch your head.

920
01:17:00,665 --> 01:17:01,992
That one right under you.

921
01:17:03,402 --> 01:17:05,374
Watch that one, guys.

922
01:17:06,103 --> 01:17:07,102
All right.

923
01:17:07,104 --> 01:17:08,107
This way.

924
01:17:29,792 --> 01:17:32,326
What? Is there another
code to crack?

925
01:17:32,328 --> 01:17:34,495
Yes, of course.

926
01:17:34,497 --> 01:17:36,429
But if we push the wrong tile...

927
01:17:36,431 --> 01:17:38,431
No, no, don't tell me,
let me guess.

928
01:17:38,833 --> 01:17:40,933
A giant dragon
will come out of nowhere

929
01:17:40,935 --> 01:17:42,236
and bite my head off.

930
01:17:42,238 --> 01:17:45,137
Funny, Gary.
We need to hurry.

931
01:17:45,139 --> 01:17:48,609
Okay, well,
has anyone got any ideas?

932
01:17:48,611 --> 01:17:50,944
<i>Well, the tiles
seem to be arranged in pairs,</i>

933
01:17:50,946 --> 01:17:51,774
<i>except these two.</i>

934
01:17:51,842 --> 01:17:53,642
<i>It's a pattern.
I know it.</i>

935
01:17:56,216 --> 01:18:02,216
- <i>...need to be a level or a switch.</i>
- <i>...like an encryption...</i>

936
01:18:14,837 --> 01:18:16,873
Luke.

937
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,200
Jia here.

938
01:18:22,845 --> 01:18:24,711
Luke!

939
01:18:25,513 --> 01:18:27,580
Jack!
It's Luke!

940
01:18:27,582 --> 01:18:29,683
You found him?
Luke?

941
01:18:29,685 --> 01:18:30,683
How is he?

942
01:18:30,685 --> 01:18:31,688
He's alive.

943
01:18:33,355 --> 01:18:37,825
Wait! The line.
It's booby-trapped!

944
01:18:37,827 --> 01:18:39,893
Chen, whatever you
were trying to figure out,

945
01:18:39,895 --> 01:18:40,695
you better do it fast.

946
01:18:40,837 --> 01:18:41,837
Okay.

947
01:18:43,998 --> 01:18:45,229
We need to get him up.

948
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Come on.

949
01:18:48,537 --> 01:18:50,137
I got you.

950
01:18:50,139 --> 01:18:52,004
Chen, you got
a way out for us?

951
01:18:52,006 --> 01:18:54,907
The Emperor associated
number six with perfection,

952
01:18:54,909 --> 01:18:55,773
so if we push...

953
01:18:55,779 --> 01:18:58,112
- Chen.
- the number six tile...

954
01:19:00,082 --> 01:19:01,484
Or you could punch it.

955
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:06,823
Come on!

956
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:29,400
<i>Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.</i>

957
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:31,900
<i>Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh.</i>

958
01:19:33,075 --> 01:19:37,748
So, you found it.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

959
01:19:37,850 --> 01:19:41,119
I'm a little pissed
at you, Jia.

960
01:19:41,121 --> 01:19:44,156
You forgot to mention that
funnel-web spiders can swim.

961
01:19:44,158 --> 01:19:46,758
Ran into a little trouble
back there

962
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:48,460
at The Emperor's Jacuzzi.

963
01:19:48,462 --> 01:19:50,795
Don't tell us
you got bit again, Mason.

964
01:19:50,797 --> 01:19:53,497
Yeah, it would be so sad
if that happened.

965
01:19:55,868 --> 01:20:00,171
Luke. We did it, son.

966
01:20:00,173 --> 01:20:03,842
You and I,
we found the miracle!

967
01:20:03,844 --> 01:20:05,576
The Fountain of Youth!

968
01:20:05,578 --> 01:20:08,112
We found hell.

969
01:20:08,114 --> 01:20:10,848
The hell The Emperor created
2,000 years ago.

970
01:20:10,850 --> 01:20:13,485
No. No, no,
you can't believe that.

971
01:20:13,487 --> 01:20:17,488
When I drink this,
I will taste immortality,

972
01:20:17,490 --> 01:20:20,459
the secret men have sought
since the dawn of time.

973
01:20:20,461 --> 01:20:22,893
It's just a pity
it's too precious to share.

974
01:20:22,895 --> 01:20:25,030
Sure you couldn't share
just a little bit?

975
01:20:25,032 --> 01:20:27,499
It's just I've got
this corn here on my pinkie...

976
01:20:27,501 --> 01:20:30,101
Shut up, Gary.
I'm talking now!

977
01:20:32,706 --> 01:20:33,938
You.

978
01:20:33,940 --> 01:20:35,674
I'm on to you.

979
01:20:35,676 --> 01:20:37,476
They're inside you.

980
01:20:37,478 --> 01:20:39,244
Just like they were
inside your mother.

981
01:20:39,246 --> 01:20:40,911
That's how they know
where we are.

982
01:20:40,913 --> 01:20:42,147
She's been leading them to us
all along.

983
01:20:42,149 --> 01:20:43,781
You're lying.

984
01:20:43,783 --> 01:20:45,717
And you lied to us
from the beginning, didn't you?

985
01:20:45,719 --> 01:20:47,818
Yeah. I lied.

986
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:49,754
I'm a businessman!

987
01:20:49,756 --> 01:20:51,755
What about our father, Mason?

988
01:20:51,757 --> 01:20:53,224
You said you didn't know

989
01:20:53,226 --> 01:20:55,160
where he was going
the day his plane went down.

990
01:20:55,162 --> 01:20:58,062
It's because my father
was close to finding something.

991
01:20:58,065 --> 01:21:00,523
I thought they were dead.
Alright!

992
01:21:00,664 --> 01:21:02,398
A plane crash
in that kind of terrain,

993
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,132
the odds were a million to one
they could survive.

994
01:21:04,134 --> 01:21:05,634
What if they were alive...

995
01:21:05,636 --> 01:21:09,305
but because of you
nobody knew where to look!

996
01:21:09,307 --> 01:21:12,740
I made a decision. I did what
was good for the company.

997
01:21:12,742 --> 01:21:14,542
If I'd given away
their location,

998
01:21:14,544 --> 01:21:17,313
our competition
would've gotten here first!

999
01:21:17,315 --> 01:21:18,713
It wasn't your decision
to make!

1000
01:21:18,715 --> 01:21:22,384
And now you're doing it
all over again.

1001
01:21:22,386 --> 01:21:25,121
Playing God with people's lives.

1002
01:21:25,123 --> 01:21:26,290
Playing God?

1003
01:21:27,858 --> 01:21:31,894
This is about becoming God!

1004
01:21:34,896 --> 01:21:36,596
Go to hell!

1005
01:21:36,598 --> 01:21:37,596
Yeah.

1006
01:21:37,598 --> 01:21:39,198
You first.

1007
01:22:04,258 --> 01:22:05,858
Ridley.

1008
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:09,295
Luke! Luke!
Are you okay?

1009
01:22:09,297 --> 01:22:10,863
Jack.

1010
01:22:20,374 --> 01:22:22,374
The elixir.

1011
01:22:22,376 --> 01:22:24,245
Mason never got to try it.

1012
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:28,300
Hand me the bottle!

1013
01:22:31,251 --> 01:22:33,685
<i>Wu Fu made enough of the elixir</i>

1014
01:22:33,687 --> 01:22:35,421
<i>to keep The Emperor alive</i>

1015
01:22:35,423 --> 01:22:37,622
<i>and to keep himself alive</i>

1016
01:22:37,624 --> 01:22:40,294
<i>to serve him for eternity.</i>

1017
01:22:41,763 --> 01:22:44,233
Go get it.

1018
01:22:57,411 --> 01:22:58,780
Here, drink it.

1019
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,500
You never gave up.

1020
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:34,200
Luke!

1021
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:40,400
Luke!

1022
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:48,400
I'll never give up on you.

1023
01:23:52,366 --> 01:23:53,865
Let's go.

1024
01:23:58,272 --> 01:24:01,539
Yeah, I reckon now is
a pretty good time to leave.

1025
01:24:01,541 --> 01:24:02,541
This way.

1026
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:20,300
The terrible thing has happened.

1027
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:21,300
What's wrong?

1028
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:24,400
This... The most frightful thing...

1029
01:25:24,424 --> 01:25:29,595
Oh, my God.
It's some kind of nest.

1030
01:25:29,597 --> 01:25:31,510
They've been leading us here...

1031
01:25:32,232 --> 01:25:35,701
Herding us like cattle
to the slaughter-house...

1032
01:25:35,703 --> 01:25:39,374
<i>Wu Fu foresaw what happened.</i>

1033
01:25:40,941 --> 01:25:43,475
<i>And here the story ends.</i>

1034
01:25:43,477 --> 01:25:45,810
<i>As the creatures multiplied,</i>

1035
01:25:45,812 --> 01:25:49,849
<i>they mutated and eventually
took over the palace...</i>

1036
01:25:49,851 --> 01:25:53,688
<i>and then,
the whole kingdom.</i>

1037
01:25:58,726 --> 01:26:00,658
To get out from here

1038
01:26:00,660 --> 01:26:05,533
we have to find
"North."

1039
01:26:24,184 --> 01:26:25,620
That has to be it.

1040
01:26:28,188 --> 01:26:29,988
Stay close to the wall.

1041
01:26:29,990 --> 01:26:33,060
Let's go.

1042
01:26:35,897 --> 01:26:38,297
Oh, God.

1043
01:26:38,299 --> 01:26:40,865
Yin, come on.

1044
01:26:46,072 --> 01:26:47,976
Look how big it is.

1045
01:26:49,776 --> 01:26:53,010
Look, there's something
strange about the tiles.

1046
01:26:53,012 --> 01:26:53,586
What do you mean?

1047
01:26:53,589 --> 01:26:56,016
Yeah, but not one says
"Push here to exit."

1048
01:26:56,017 --> 01:26:56,835
I'll tell ya why,

1049
01:26:56,838 --> 01:26:59,890
'cause nothing's ever simple
on this freaking joint.

1050
01:27:01,955 --> 01:27:04,189
Huh, great,
now her friend's join her.

1051
01:27:04,191 --> 01:27:06,828
They're communicating
with each other.

1052
01:27:18,505 --> 01:27:19,904
Be careful, Yin.

1053
01:27:19,906 --> 01:27:22,006
Be careful!

1054
01:27:30,218 --> 01:27:32,751
Everything's gonna be okay.

1055
01:27:34,955 --> 01:27:36,221
Hey!

1056
01:27:49,270 --> 01:27:51,002
We gotta go.
Hurry!

1057
01:27:51,004 --> 01:27:52,003
Hold on.

1058
01:27:56,511 --> 01:27:57,976
Hurry!

1059
01:27:57,978 --> 01:27:59,712
Luke, punch the tile!

1060
01:28:04,718 --> 01:28:06,185
Watch out!
It's coming down!

1061
01:28:06,187 --> 01:28:07,722
Yin!

1062
01:28:11,925 --> 01:28:13,829
- Over there!
- Got an exit!

1063
01:28:15,029 --> 01:28:17,162
- Go!
- Gotta get out now!

1064
01:28:17,164 --> 01:28:19,564
- Go!
- Come on, Jia!

1065
01:28:19,566 --> 01:28:21,235
Go!

1066
01:29:36,710 --> 01:29:38,079
Let's go home.
