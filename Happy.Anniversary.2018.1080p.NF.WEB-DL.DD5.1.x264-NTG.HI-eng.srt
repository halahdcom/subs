(INHALES) This is a Ometepe.

00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,147
It's beautiful.

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,982
It's gorgeous. Thanks for showing us that.

6
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:25,608
- Thank you.
- Thanks for that gift.

7
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,987
Lindsay and I hiked to the peak,
and we swam in a crater.

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,740
- MAN 2: Oh, wow.
- Only took us 12 hours up and down.

00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,909
- Is that all?
- Twelve hours? That's it? Fuck.

10
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:38,329
- I uncovered a lot that I'd been burying.
- Oh.

11
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:41,708
The food at the Eagle Lodge.
The breakfast is insane.

12
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,460
- Hao, show them.
- Oh, yeah.

13
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:46,379
We actually love breakfast.
We've seen a ton of breakfasts. Thank you.

14
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,673
I'm sure. And the pictures
are so small you can barely…

15
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,842
You're right. You know, watch this.

16
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:52,260
What?

17
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:54,179

- Just takes a second.

18
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:57,640
LINDSAY: Yeah. It'll work, it'll work.
It's worth the wait.

00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:02,854
Do you want more fernet?

20
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:05,190

- We're still… Yeah.

- Oh, I know.

29
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:28,129
- Why can't they just drink wine?
- Because everybody drinks wine.

30
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,715
Yeah. Well, everyone drinks wine
for a reason.

31
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,634
How long till we have to
hang out with them again?

32
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:36,095
I know. I know it's annoying,
but Lindsay's like family to me.

33
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,555
We went to college together.

A bunch of people went to art school
with Hitler, but eventually they moved on.

- You clicked before ugly bush.
- Bullshit.

50
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,466
You did. It was way before the bush.

51
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,135
No. We grazed the fucking fence.

52
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,928
I actually think
that we scratched the bumper.

53
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,555
So? That's what it's there for.

54
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,099
It's called a bumper.
It's meant to bump into things.

55
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,184
But they charge you for that
when you return the lease,

56
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:26,062
and I think some of the rubber
rubbed off on the fucking fence.

57
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,981
Landlord's gonna take that
out of our security deposit.

58
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:31,401
You're right. We should move out before
our landlord realizes what we've done.

59
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:35,029
We could hide out on Ometepe.

Yeah, I've seen pictures.

62

You know, Lindsay and Hao make
all other humans miserable,

63
00:02:43,306 --> 00:02:44,853
but they actually make
each other really happy.

Oh, my God. Those two?

65

Yeah. I know it's crazy, but he looks
at her like he's just met her.

00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:51,963
That's a fuckin' act.

67
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,131
- No, it's not.
- It is.

68
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,633
No, when they talk to each other,
they're not just talking.

69
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,636
- They're really listening.
- Believe me, it's bullshit, okay?

70
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,721
They're not happy.

I am so sorry.

I know. I wasn't planning
on saying anything today.

You are such a good person, Sam,
and I want to be happy with you.

00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,552
I really, really do, but…

123
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,554
We've been together for three years.
You couldn't talk to me?

124
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:49,640
Every time I try and talk to you
about my feelings, you get mad.

125
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,894
That's because your feelings
are fucking bullshit.

126
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,730
You get off on not being happy
when everything's fucking fine.

Are you fucking serious?

128
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,862
Did that seem fine to you?

129
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,700
I'm not saying that we're perfect. Okay?

130
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,494
Nobody's fucking perfect.

131
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,162
I know that.

132
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:15,875
I just want the most perfect version
of imperfectness.

133
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,006
I, um…

134
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,134
Tell me what's wrong.
What are you missing?

135
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,596
I know I miss the person
that I met three years ago.

136
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,515
You can't do that, okay?

137
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,642
You can't compare me now
to the me three years ago.

138
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,061
- That guy was wooing you.
- You should never stop wooing.

139
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:38,773
This orange juice is freshly squeezed.
I just wooed your ass off.

140
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,191
You drove ten minutes.

141
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:43,194
Into gang territory.
How do you forget that so quickly?

142
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,779
For your favorite scone.

143
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:47,115
We split this thing every time we go.

144
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,450
- You love that fucking scone.
- No, they're fine, okay?

145
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,577
You were so excited to get me
to try them the first time

146
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,831
that I didn't want to disappoint you,
but you love these things, Sam.

147
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,208
My guess is you probably woke up
this morning craving them,

148
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,877
and you knew you had to do something
vaguely nice for our anniversary,

149
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,922
so you decided to kill two birds
with one scone.

150
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,008
In England, they pronounce it “skahn.”

151
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,845
When's the last time
you did something just for me?

152
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,597
Because that's what the guy
that I first met would do.

153
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,266
That guy was romantic.

154
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,652
Come on. Let's go sit down.

155
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:35,705
Shira? No, sorry.

00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,877
Are you absolutely sure
you're not Shira Weinberg?

157
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:43,546
Yeah, I'm almost positive
my name is Mollie.

158
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,839
- Mollie.
- Mm-hmm.

159
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:47,592
- Of course. Nice to meet you, Mollie.
- Nice to meet you.

160
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,221
If I flirt with you right now,
I look like an asshole, right?

161
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,265
Because you know
I'm waiting for somebody else?

162
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,018
You have amazing eyes, Mollie.

163
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,604
I did it. Fuck it, I did it.
I flirted with you anyway.

164
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:02,732
Who am I? I'm Sam. Nice to meet you.

165
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,736
So is it like a blind date?

166
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,363
(CLICKS TONGUE, SIGHS) Well, to be honest…

167
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,699
I love when people specify “to be honest.”

168
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,910
Does that mean I can assume
everything you've said before

169
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,323
and are about to say
to me is bullshit?

170
00:08:19,234 --> 00:08:21,588
- It's an Internet date.
- God help you.

171
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,420
Mmm. I don't think he will,
seeing as I don't believe in him,

172
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,297
which is probably why
he's punishing me now

173
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,925
by making you not Shira Weinberg.

174
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,885
You really don't believe
that there's anything out there?

175
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,970
I don't not believe.

176
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,640
I feel like it's something
that humans can never fathom.

177
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:38,935
Like quarks. Or black Republicans.

178
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:42,647
- I believe in ghosts.
- I am so sorry. I think I did see Shira.

179
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,731
I know it's crazy,

180
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:47,109
but I like people too much
to believe that they just go away.

181
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,613
I wish I liked people that much.

182
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,698
Maybe you just know the wrong ones.

183
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,330
So what is this meeting?
Is it like a thing?

184
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,249
- A thing?
- Is it a date? I want to know…

185
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,833
- Is it a date?
- I'm not answering that question.

186
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:03,918
Okay.

187
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,755
And it looks like your thing
just walked in.

188
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,966
No, no, no, no. That is not Shira.

189
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,759
You're right. She's more of a Dawn.

190
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:15,054
- Oh, that's a Dawn.
- Yeah, she lives at home with her parents.

191
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,514
She's really into firemen.

192
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,349
Yeah, she used to be a cheerleader,

193
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,268
but one of the ones
on the bottom of the pyramid,

194
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,895
because she's beautiful but also sturdy,
knows how to get it done.

195
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,314
- I used to be a cheerleader.
- I'm listening.

196
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,816
It was the worst.

197
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,694
The football players smelled.
The girls were brutal to me.

198
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:33,197
They absolutely tortured me.
If you were just at all different…

199
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,449
Do you still have the uniform or…

200
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,703
I am opening up my soul to you
about the torture of my childhood,

201
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:39,787
and this is your question?

202
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,498
I'm so sorry, but do you have the uniform?

203
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,001
I have it somewhere, yeah.

204
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,630
All right, Mollie. We know about Dawn.

205
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,425
Why don't we give these two a shot?
Who are these two?

206
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:55,261
Well, she's Patricia,
a pharmaceutical rep,

207
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,721
and Dale.

208
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,055
- Oh, wow.
- The doctor.

209
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,349
- Of course he is.
- And he became a doctor

210
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,517
to meet a pharmaceutical rep.

211
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,102
This happened the exact way he wanted?

212
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,520
- Exactly.
- Unbelievable.

213
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,356
It's under Weinberg. W-E-I-N…

214
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,275
- Ah.
- …berg as in “berg.”

215
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,152
- Hey, she's cute.
- Yeah.

216
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:12,945
- I have really good taste in women.
- Mm-hmm.

217
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,828
Hey.

218
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,121
(KISSING)

219
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:25,374
You were nervous that that was my thing.

220
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,170
You were nervous I was gonna
fall in love with Shira Weinberg.

221
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,715
Now, Mollie, if you will, I have to go.

222
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,925
Lateness is one of Shira's pet peeves.

223
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,596
- You're actually gonna go through with it?
- Yeah.

224
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,974
I can't leave her stranded like that.
That'd be cruel.

225
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,100
Also, she is waving.

226
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:46,979
Could you wave back with me
so it looks like we're… Yes. Fantastic.

227
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,439
Okay. Great.

228
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:52,151
Rest assured though, I'll be
thinking about you the entire time.

229
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,363
Bye, Moll.

230
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,993
Hey. Mollie, what do you do for a living?

231
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,330
Really? I expected more from you
than that. That is such a cliché question.

232
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,539
Yeah, it's a cliché question,

233
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,209
but if you don't tell me,
how am I going to be able to stalk you?

234
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:14,090
The edible arrangement you sent?
That guy was romantic.

235
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,425
Romantic. You're pissing in front of me.

236
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,010
Yeah, I've been drinking a lot of water.

237

I'm staying hydrated.
You should be happy for me.

238
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:21,722
And you didn't love that guy.

239
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,683
You hated the me you met.
You know you did.

240
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:25,976
I did not.

241

- You did. You hated my hair.
- Yeah, it was science teacher creepy.

- You hated my clothes.
- Oh, yeah.

243
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,858
Do you remember those shoes?

244
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,944
- You hated my apartment.
- Yeah, it was depressing.

245
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:38,072
What's depressing is your idealizing the
past when you were never happy with me.

246
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:40,825
- You're never happy with anything.
- (SIGHS) There's nothing to eat.

on the bed right now,

Oh, my God. Shut the fuck up, Donny.

Wait, wait. You're all right.

There's nothing out there.

Or maybe there is.

255
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,348
No. I think you just smell
a raccoon or something.

256
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,766
Yeah, either that or

257
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:10,020
there's an evil creature
lurking in the bushes, taunting him.

258
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,356
But you will never catch him

259
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,900
- for there is no creature.
- Oh, my God.

260
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:18,154
Because the creature is you! Whoo… Oh!

My… What? Why do you do that?

- It is kind of funny.

00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:09,723
No. I'm not laughing.

309
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,892
Because Grindhorst sucked my penis
in a surprising way.

310
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:12,810
Oh, God.

311
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,895
You would have loved the way
he sucked my dick.

Today's your big work thing.

00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,063
Yep, which is why I was hoping for
a little more support

320
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,773
and a little less “I'm not happy.”

321
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:03,319
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry my feelings
don't line up with your schedule.

322
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,070
You know, you can't control emotions.

Are you fucking serious? Coming from you?

You're like the Wayne Gretzky
of emotion control.

325
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:13,078
You somehow manage to control
whether or not you fall in love.

326
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:16,916
It's not called “gently reclining”
in love. It's called falling in love.

327
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,626
Because, yeah, it could hurt,

you've been wading into a pool
for three years.

331

Just slowly, painfully,
adjusting to the cold.

332
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,389
At some point, usually when the water
touches your balls

333
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,516
or the bottom of your vagina,
people just jump in.

of hair three times, we wouldn't be late.

00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,945
I'm trying to fix
this piece of hair for you

so that I can make you look good.

going to the dinner party late?

So glad we weren't late.

And does Woofington do human cases,
or is it, like, pet cases?

369
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:44,730
No, it's human.

Yeah, but I might as well start
since it's all bullshit.

- No.
- Why not?

00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,810
Because I don't want to lose you.

I don't want to lose you either.

we have to get married.

Why do we have to decide now?
Why can't we take our time?

Because I don't have any more time, Sam.

Oh, right. So this is the baby thing?

- This is fucking insane.

- Sam…
- Amazing. Amazing.

our relationship doesn't even exist yet.

You don't understand how much pressure
there is for me. It's easy for you.

00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:14,444
You can have a Steve Martin baby
when you're 80.

398
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:18,157
I don't want to have a baby when I'm an
old man who can't pick up his fucking kid.

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,158
You would love that.

400
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:22,828
I could think of nothing you would love
more than not having to carry your baby.

401
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:23,996
Yeah, that would be nice.

402
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,290
Meanwhile I'm a 30-ish-years-old woman.

403
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:29,001
I should have figured this shit out
like yesterday.

404
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:33,213
What, I have, like, four, five years
for me not to have a messed-up baby?

405
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:36,341
If you're not the guy,
I need to budget time to find the guy.

406
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,886
Then there's another three years
of vetting, and my biological clock

407
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:42,222
is just ticking down, tick, tick, tick,
fast approaching zero.

408
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,974
Basically, I'm in The Hurt Locker.

409

The Hurt Locker.
You know what? You're right.

- I do hope you find

412
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:53,525
that perfectly imperfect person,
but I have news for you.

413
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,985
He doesn't exist.

414
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:57,237
You won't let yourself be happy.

415
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,076
It's not easy for me, Sam.

416
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,621
My… My parents, it's…

417
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:20,928
We're not them.

418
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,138
I don't want to stay together
just to stay together.

419
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,641
Barely speak to each other,
sleep in separate rooms.

420
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,684
Oh, my God, you would love your own room.

421
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,186
- Yeah.
- You could stretch out.

422
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,730
You could do that weird
fucking thing that you do in bed.

423
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,232
Yeah, it would be really nice.

424
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:36,902
Look, maybe I…

425
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:41,323
Maybe I'll just stay
with my parents for a little while.

426
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:44,493
Obviously if you want to be near your dad
when he's sick, I get it.

427
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,494
Yeah.

428
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:50,457
And it would be good for me to see things
from another perspective.

429
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,210
What does that mean,
“another perspective”?

430
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,587
You know,
give us space to clear our heads.

431
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,589
Like a little break.

432
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,509
Mollie, is this about… Hey, Mollie?

433
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,262
Mollie…

434
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,015
Is this about your dad,
or is this about us breaking up?

435
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,227
- Space can be good.
- How long you been planning this?

436
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:15,023
It's just a time-out.
It doesn't have to be a huge thing.

437
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,359
Pick up the rest of your shit today.
All right?

438
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,444
Come on. Whoa.

439
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,449
Well, fuck. (SIGHS)

440
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,787
Fine. It's totally okay.

441
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,707
We both needed a break. Just…

442
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:34,710
(GRUNTS) Oh.

443
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,095
I don't need a man.

444
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,682
I got it. You're independent, Mollie.

445
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,393
Mom?

446
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,442
MAN: She's dead to me.

447
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,943
The thing about Mollie is…

448
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,696
Who? Oh, the dead girl,
because she's so dead to me.

449
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,031
Ed, you can't say that…

450
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,867
This woman strings you along
for three fucking years.

451
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:10,620
And not just any years.
The golden fucking years of your mid-30s.

452
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,665
- It's more complicated than that.
- How is it complicated?

453
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,834
She's an awful person.
She doesn't appreciate you.

454
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:19,629
You don't understand, okay?
All you see is happy fun-time friend Sam.

455
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,882
- I'm a blast around you.
- You're not that fun.

You're not privy to all my faults, like
two beers almost always leads to eight,

457
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:29,347
and when I get upset,
I say these venomous, acidic things

458
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,433
that I would never say in a million years.

459
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,351
Also, I'm not as thoughtful
as I was at the beginning.

460
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,728
Basically, you're a human being.

461
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:38,482
And believe me,
you're a really good one, Sam.

462
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:41,109
All right?
And if she can't see that, then fuck her!

463
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,235
Wow, that turned.

464
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,487
Come here.

465
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,197
- Come here.
- Nah.

466
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,199
- Hey, hey.
- I don't want to.

467
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:51,119
I have never seen anyone
more in need of a hug in my life.

468
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,288
Bring that shit in. Come here. Come on.

469
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:54,790
- I don't want to.
- It's happening.

470
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,166
- Don't. Don't.
- Five, four,

471
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:57,584
- three…
- Four, five.

472
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:58,668
- Don't count up.
- Six.

473
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,962
You messed it… Fuck this. There we go.

474
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,090
- There it is. Mmm.
- Mmm.

475
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:05,842
Just breathe. There you go.

476
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:06,760
(EXHALES)

477
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,762
It's a huge problem with American men,

478
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:12,099
how you're uncomfortable
sharing physical affection like this.

479
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,351
Did you know Italian dudes
hold hands in the street?

480
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:15,644
I didn't know that.

481
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,480
- French dudes kiss hello.
- On the mouth?

482
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,065
I was watching footie the other night,

483
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:23,110
and this Portuguese player scored a goal,
and basically a gang bang broke out.

484
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,695
I don't get soccer.

485
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:28,907
I feel better. I do feel better.

486
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,535
(CHUCKLES) Thank you for that.

487
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,558
Oh, you just checked to
see if she texted you.

488
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,113
I'm checking to see if
the buyer called, okay?

489
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,751
It's like you just gave her your digits

490
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,837
and you're waiting for
that first text back.

491
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:51,972
(DING)

492
00:23:58,645 --> 00:23:59,646
(WARBLES)

493
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,276
(WARBLES)

494
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:07,028
(WARBLES)

495
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,533
- (WARBLES)
- (CHUCKLES)

496
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:17,455
Ahhh…

497
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,265
Ahem!

498
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,683
Whoo!

499
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:42,230
We've got to get you back out there.

500
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,065
I'm gonna set you up
with one of Priya's mates.

501
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:47,235
Jesus Christ. Ed, no, no, no, no.

502
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,780
The last thing I want to do in the fucking
universe now is start dating again.

503
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:53,366
I used to think that arranged marriages
were unethical,

504
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,119
but now I'm starting to think
they're the less painful process.

505
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,705
Doing it ourselves? That shit is inhumane.

506
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:02,167
Look at your parents. They had an arranged
marriage, and they're super happy.

507
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,420
My parents met at medical school.

508
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:06,671
- Right.
- Yeah.

509
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,506
- Asshole.
- Right, right.

510
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,592
I was kidding. I was kidding.

511
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:17,599
I know that Sam's a good person deep down,
but is that good enough?

512
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:20,477
And is good enough
good enough for the rest of my life?

513
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,313
- No kidding.
- (EARPHONES: MAN SPEAKING)

514
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,900
And that's when I decided to kill Sam.

515
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:28,443
Yeah.

516
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:31,238
With one of those spiky metal balls,
and nobody's been suspicious,

517
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:34,324
because I've just been dragging his corpse
around Weekend at Bernie's style.

518
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:37,702
- Well, he's a good guy, Mollie.
- (SIGHS)

519
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:40,538
- What are you listening to?
- What? No, I have it…

520
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:43,208
- I have it way down.
- Torah on Tape?

521
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:46,544
You know,
I've never actually read the whole Bible.

522
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:49,381
You still haven't read it.
Somebody's reading it to you.

523
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:50,924
- What?
- Okay.

524
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:53,927
It's just gonna be the one night here.
Then I'm gonna stay with a friend.

525
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,554
Listen, you're gonna work this out
with Sam, okay?

526
00:25:56,638 --> 00:26:00,016
I mean,
you're always like this with decisions.

527
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,018
- This is different.
- How?

528
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:03,895
I don't know. I guess…

529
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:07,691
it doesn't just affect me,
it's also about Sam.

530
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:10,402
And a potential baby creature.

531
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:13,321
- No.
- Oh!

532
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,991
- Mom…
- Oh, wait. Shh.

533
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,076
Oh, I think I felt something.

534
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:23,039
Oh, congratulations. You are the proud
grandmother of a vegan breakfast bowl.

535
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,918
That's mean. That's just mean.

536
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:30,714
Andiamo, bella. We go chemo.

537
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,299
Yeah, we go chemo.

538
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,592
…A high wind advisory
for Riverside County…

539
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:37,595
Ah. Fucking Hal-a Storm.

540
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,139
You don't like Hal Storm?

541
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:40,807
He hates him.

542
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,684
He think he so smart.

543
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:44,769
Hal-a Storm.

544
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:48,231
- One hundred years young today.
- (LAUGHING) Wow!

545
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:50,025
Moses.

546
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,193
- Come on.
- MOLLIE'S MOM: Crazy.

547
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:57,282
So we get into
this very real fucking fight.

548
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,200
Then instead of dealing with it,

549
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,494
she goes and runs off
to her fucking parents.

550
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:05,540
No, I don't buy it.
No, she's probably with a rebound guy.

551
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:08,293
Rebounding right onto
another dude's genitals.

552
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,671
Say what you will about Mollie,
she'd never do anything like that.

553
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,590
Oh, you're naive.

554
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:15,800
- Women are like dogs.
- Wow. I say that as a dog lover.

555
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:20,263
But the truth is,
you have to establish dominance early,

556
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:22,599
- or they'll piss all over your rug.
- Okay.

557
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,351
For the record, we've always hated her.

558
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:26,353
Who's “we”?

559
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,480
Me and your mum. We Facebook message.

560
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:30,315
My mom's on Facebook? This is your problem, mate.

561
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:34,736
Mollie is some flip-over-your-head,

562
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:37,530
bicycle kick,
high-degree-of-difficulty shit.

563
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,574
It doesn't have to be this hard.

564
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:41,701
Go for a girl that's into you.

565
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:45,121
What about the one you whined about
before Mollie? That lasted, like, a year.

566
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:47,916
Georgia.

567
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,645
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

568
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:11,106
Georgia was… She was awesome.

569
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:14,901
She was sweet, she was nice,
but I feel like something was missing.

570
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:16,611
Yeah, the misery.

571
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,364
Maybe Mollie and I are just too different.

572
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,991
Like I see the glass of water
as half full.

573
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,035
She sees the water as poisoned.

574
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,788
Also, there's a chip in the glass,
so when you drink it,

575
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,848
it's gonna cut your esophagus,
you're gonna bleed everywhere.

576
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,922
Why don't we ask that
waiter for a new glass now.

577
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:33,962
She just won't let herself be happy.

578
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,672
And neither will you.

579
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:39,592
Stop punishing yourself.
Find something simpler.

580
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,303
Can we please
just get ready for this pitch?

581
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,598
I can't work in the fucking office
designing deodorant labels anymore.

582
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,226
We have to get our shirts on this website.

583
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,646
- Eddie, is it okay if I do…
- No, not in this heat.

584
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,231
- No, you don't have to.
- Hey, hey.

585
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:56,443
Cold, cold, low spin.
The sexy shit doesn't go in the dryer.

586
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:58,027
- Yeah.
- I got it.

587
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,362
Okay. Good luck, guys.

588
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:00,947
- Bye, muffin.
- Thanks, Priya.

589
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,870
- What?
- I'm trying to remember.

590
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:09,122
- It's cold, cold, low spin.
- Cold, cold…

591
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:10,623
Wait, wait. Cold, cold.

592
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:11,624
- Low spin.
- Low spin.

593
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,876
- Go fuck yourself.
- Fantastic.

594
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,794
You're like Cesar Millan
the way you establish dominance.

595
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:17,630
- This is an entirely different situation.
- That is totally different?

596
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:19,007
Tell me why.

597
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,676
I'm not supposed to say anything
for, like, three months,

598
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,012
- but that's in a week.
- Oh.

599
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,222
- That woman now carries my seed.
- Ed.

600
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,600
It's a total shift
in the dominance paradigm.

601
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,935
My prince is in there.
That makes her a queen.

602
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,688
Are you…? Mmm…

603
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,315
You barely know this girl.

604
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:36,483
I know.

605
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,234
But look at what you're dealing with.

606
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:41,029
Maybe it's better this way, right?
Rip off the Band-Aid.

607
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,448
How does it even…? Did the condom break?

608
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:45,283
There's no condom. I do the pullout.

609
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,577
- You do the pullout method?

from preschool at 4:30.

Great. Great. Kids are important.

Sam. How come he no ask you to marry?

625
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,670
Because he knows
that we're still figuring it out.

Oh, no rush.

Stage four. I have plenty of time.

628
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:46,427
Uh, thank you. I needed more pressure.

00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:49,013
- You better adjust your thinking, Curly.
- Yeah.

630
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:52,016
Because even if I get back together
with Sam,

631
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,893
I don't think we're going to get married.

632

What is this?

633
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,980
- Yeah, marriage is bullshit.
- Ah!

634
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:59,899
And weddings are an even bigger waste.
Why should I get married?

635

So we can get new plates
we're afraid to eat off of?

Beautiful. Capito?

640
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,541
- You want to know why I cry at weddings?
- Ah.

641
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:19,544
- Because I feel bad for the bride.
- (CHUCKLES)

If he asked me today, I'd say no.

But you wrong.
And he should still ask you.

644
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:28,219
That would require him
making a big decision on his own,

and, trust me, that ain't happening.

Ooh, they're great.

00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:37,312
- Yeah, but which do you prefer?
- I don't…

649
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,606
- No, pick one.
- The one in the middle.

00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,598
You have until when-this-dries-o'clock

768
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,018
to convince me
why I need to sell your shit.

769
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:35,521
Thank you so much for… Um…

770
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:37,273
- We feel like our designs…
- (PHONE CHIMING)

771
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:38,482
That's so unprofessional.

772
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,942
If it's important…

773
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,485
(CHIMING)

774
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:42,570
No.

775
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,947
- No.
- No, it's definitely not important.

776
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,032
What's important is you

777
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:48,367
and you understanding
that the way we get our ideas…

778
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:49,952
- (CHIMING)
- Fuck. Fuck.

779
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,454
Who is it?

780
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:53,789
It is… Ugh.

781
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,958
I don't want to tell you.
It's a competing e-tailer.

782
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,835
(SNORTS) We're hot right now,

783
00:38:57,918 --> 00:39:00,254
so a lot of calls are coming in on
my personal cellular device,

784
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,422
but our focus is on you.

785
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,632
- What's her name?
- Her name is Mollie.

786
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:05,468
- Girlfriend.
- Oh, here we go.

787
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,678
- We broke up this morning.
- Who broke up with whom?

788
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,056
- Ah, it's complicated.
- She dumped him.

789
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,599
- Big-time.
- Hey.

790
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,351
Answer it. I don't mind.

791
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:16,354
I'm not gonna answer the phone call.
We're here to do a pitch and…

792
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:20,107
- (CHIMING)
- Fucking what? Oh, my God! I'm sorry.

793
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,318
I'll pick up. Then we don't have to
talk about it ever again.

794
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:24,445
Hey. Mollie? I can't talk now.

795
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:25,988
I need you to come home.

796
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,281
This is not the time.

797
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,743
Shit. Of course, it's your work thing.
I'm sorry. Never mind.

798
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:32,036
- (LINE BEEPING)
- Hello?

799
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:33,871
Hello?

800
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:42,880
(STAMMERS)

801
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,057
We feel like our smaller design

802
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,476
helps us stand out
in an overcrowded marketplace.

803
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,728
- What happened?
- Over there?

804
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,648
Nothing. She wanted eggs.
I'm gonna get her some eggs.

805
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:05,069
That blouse costs $1,500.
Now tell me the truth.

806
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:09,031
It was Mollie.
She wants me to come home right now.

807
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,200
But I'm not gonna come home right now.

808
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:12,410
Do you love this woman?

809
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,374
Hey. I love you.

810
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,711
Hey, I love you too.
- (CHUCKLES) - Bonk.

811
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,844
- Total bonk.
- (CHUCKLES)

812
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:34,140
(CHUCKLING)

813
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,017
That's a long answer.

814
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,185
It shouldn't be.

815
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:43,232
Go home. That should be your priority.

816
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:46,152
I see what you're doing, and it's awesome,
but I'm not going home.

817
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:49,113
I wouldn't want to be in business with
someone who didn't understand that notion.

818
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:51,282
- Do you understand that notion, Sam?
- Yes, ma'am.

819
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,869
I'll be so quick
you won't know that I'm gone.

820
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,704
Preschool pickup is at 4:30.

821
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:57,997
4:30. That's so easy.

822
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,124
- I am so sorry.
- Die in a fire.

823
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:01,208
SAM: Yes.

824
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,879
(LAUGHS) We-We-We feel our costs are…

825
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,717
- (DRYER BUZZES)
- Oh, the whites are done.

826
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:12,386
Mollie!

827
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:16,932
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
What the fuck is that?

828
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,685
(DONNY WHINES)

829
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,356
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, are you okay?
Are you all right?

830
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,942
Yeah, I came back to get
the rest of my stuff,

831
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:29,653
and then Donny
was barking crazier than ever, and…

832
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:33,115
- (COUGHING)
- …turns out there is a creature.

833
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,742
- It's a skunk.
- Yeah.

834
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,744
- It's gonna be okay, all right?
- Yeah.

835
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,454
- Yeah?
- Yeah. (SNIFFLES)

836
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:42,625
Um, I'm not crying. I'm just… It's the…

837
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,543
It's the smell
that's making my eyes water.

838
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:47,046
I know. I can feel it on my tongue.

839
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:50,257
I googled it, and it says that we're
supposed to bathe him in tomato juice.

840
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:53,928
But turns out the only person
who's prepared for a skunking

841
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,554
is my grandma. (SNIFFS)

842
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:56,972
- Oh.
- (DONNY WHINES)

843
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:58,474
I think we have something.

844
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:02,144
Aw. Yeah, that's a good boy.

845
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:04,230
- (DONNY WHINES)
- TOGETHER: Oh.

846
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,314
- Hey.
- I got him.

847
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:06,899
- No, no.
- I got him.

848
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:09,026
Hold still, beast.

849
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:11,195
God. Oh, no, he's licking it.

850
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:12,613
No, Donny, no.

851
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:17,034
No, Donny, no. Do you have a notion
of how disgusting what you're doing is?

852
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:19,703
I don't know. I guess that's good, right?

853
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:20,955
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

854
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:23,791
Should I get the vodka?
Just throw it in the tub?

855
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,709
- Aaah!
- SAM: Oh!

856
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:31,382
It'll come out. It'll come out.

857
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:34,843
Oh!

858
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,679
- Oh, it drips down.
- (LAUGHS)

859
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:39,181
No, no. (SCREAMS)

860
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,350
- (LAUGHS)
- You look like Carrie.

861
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,478
What is that? That's not Carrie.
That's just a scared person.

862
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,397
- Donny! Oh.
- (GRUNTS)

863
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:49,149
(MOLLIE LAUGHS) Oh, no.

864
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,027
- He's on the bed.
- Oh, no!

865
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,946
He's 100 percent on the bed
going like this.

866
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:56,615
- Tomato shit all over our fucking room.
- (LAUGHS)

867
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:19,388
- Time's up.
- What? Oh, no, that's soaking.

868
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:22,141
You can't wear that. You'll catch a cold
or something, freeze your tits off.

869
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:23,642
I'm sorry, I thought you were…

870
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:26,520
Ed?

871
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:29,273
It's nothing. They ruined my top.

872
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:30,899
Oh, my God. Is that Couture?

873
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:32,985
It was.

874
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:36,113
Oh, I'll let you get back to it.

875
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,825
She seemed lovely.

876
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:41,327
We're having a baby.

877
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,412
- Yeah. Mazel tov.
- Yeah.

878
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:46,749
Pullout?

879
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:48,876
When I remember.

880
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:50,252
Yeah.

881
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:55,257
Ooh, up top.

882
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,134
- Very well done today.
- Whoo!

883
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:59,219
- Oh.
- (LAUGHS)

884
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,430
Oh, my God. How do you think that ranks?

885
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:02,598
It was very good.

886
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:05,726
I would probably say top three.
Honestly, I gotta put it in the top three.

887
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,019
Really? That's all?

888
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:08,896
- That's all?
- What beats it?

889
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,189
Montecito.

890
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,358
- Yeah.
- Ah.

891
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,823
Oh, my God. You're gonna love this hotel.

892
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,284
- They give you your own entire casita.
- Mmm.

893
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:24,912
Sounds like a place
that a fancy businessman would stay

894
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:28,290
and, like, order
a very expensive escort for the evening.

895
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:30,250
- Yes, this is the place. Yes.
- Yeah.

896
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:32,836
Let's do it.

897
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:36,590
You want to get a hooker?

898
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:39,134
No, no, I want to be the hooker.

899
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:41,553
And you're the elegantly depraved
hedge fund guy.

900
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:43,931
Yeah?

901
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:47,101
Good evening, prostitute. It's good…
That's stupid. Think depraved.

902
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,895
I'm bad news.
I'm Walter Matthau Bad News Bears.

903
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:50,813
Come here often?

904
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:53,399
No, she's coming to your room.
She's never been there before.

905
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:55,401
I've fucked women twice your size.

906
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:57,861
No, that doesn't add up.

907
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:02,157
Is that butthole open for business?

908
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:05,494
Is that butthole…? Is that tokus…?
No, tushy.

909
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,330
Does that tushy need a banging?

910
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:10,582
I guess I'm a bad boy too.

911
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,960
Yeah, I cheat on my taxes.

912
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,045
Bet you 500 bucks I can fuck you.

913
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:18,757
That's basically what a prostitute is.
Like a weird bet.

914
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:24,555
Ooh!

915
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:39,027
Thanks.

916
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:00,299
Hi.

917
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:03,260
Oh, gosh.

918
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:08,599
I'm not actually a hooker. I'm just
doing this for fun with my boyfriend.

919
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:09,600
Is that worse?

920
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:12,436
Checking in?

921
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:15,314

- I want to be like this.

01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:09,702
- Here we go. Ready?
- I think we'll do one of our classics.

1237
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:11,204
Ready and… Whoo!

Hmm.

Do you like jam? I forget.
Do you love jam or do you like jam?

And I think if you just try the jam.

Your key, sir.

And will your “lady friend”
be arriving shortly?

Okay. You?

kind of shitty.

- Well, I just met a beautiful woman.

- That redhead?
- No, I'm talking about you.

Come on, dude. Fuck.

You see them? Who do you think they are?

- What do you mean?
- Like watch this.

I think he's a professional golfer, right?

1278
01:07:01,767 --> 01:07:04,228
And she's his mistress.
And he knows he's got to stop.

1279
01:07:04,311 --> 01:07:06,105
He knows
he's got to stop doing stuff with her,

1280
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:09,025
but he keeps landing in the top ten
ever since they've been having sex,

1281
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:12,111
so he feels like he can't get rid of her
or he's gonna start losing.

1282
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:14,739
Okay, so who are they?
Tell me who they are.

1283

Joan and Lee first met in October of 1964.

He served with her brother Arnold
in the war.

1294

Even then there was something special
between them.

Do not get a massage here.

The spa plays Enya so loudly,

1298
01:08:08,959 --> 01:08:11,670
and my massage therapist
had these giant sandpaper hands.

1299
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:14,548
I swear to God,
I think she fucked up my neck permanently.

Is it, like, bad here?

1303
01:08:23,015 --> 01:08:24,892
That actually feels really good.

1304
01:08:24,975 --> 01:08:27,144
- Is that the spot? Is that too hard?
- Um…

1305
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:31,315
You could probably get a better angle
if I was lying down.

Yeah. Um… Yeah.

1307

After a few years, they grew apart.

Deaths happened.

1312
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:52,461
It was at Arnie's funeral
that they reconnected.
