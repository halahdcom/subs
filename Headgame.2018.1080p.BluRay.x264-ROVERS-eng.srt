1
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,232
Let me be very clear

2
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,193
with all of you.

3
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,551
One of you in this room
tonight...

4
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,553
is going to die.

5
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,996
Welcome to Headgame.

6
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,956
Out you go, little guy.

7
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,112
- Okay, how do I look?
- Perfect.

8
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,518
Hot, rich guy asks you out
at the gym.

9
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,076
Why can't that happen to me?

10
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,680
It's bad luck to open that
in the house.

11
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,997
Oh.

12
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,237
Okay, he's here.
I got to go.

13
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,590
I love you.

14
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,792
Have fun...

15
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,116
bitch.

00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,200
I was going to say,
where are we going?

22
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,113
We're in the middle of nowhere.

Hey, do you want to meet

35
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,833
I'm betting you'll fit right in.

36
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,552
So, what do you say?

37
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,638
Are you game?

Yeah, I'm game.

39
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,872
I thought you might be.

40
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,113
Now the game is set.

41
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,556
Let's meet our players.

42
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,993
This is Jackson.

43
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,477
Strong-willed, motivated,
extremely confident.

44
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,713
I've done McKinley, K2,
Kilimanjaro, and Everest.

45
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,515
This year I'm doing
Puncak Jaya and Kosciuszko.

46
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,155
Next year I'll do Mt. Vinson
to finish off Seven Summits.

47
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,631
Typically excels
in high-stress situations,

48
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,877
although I don't imagine
he's ever had to deal

49
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,434
with anything like this.

50
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,915
Nevertheless, he's...

51
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,196
Impressive.

52
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,834
I think so.

53
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,639
And he knows it.

54
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,116
Here is Anton.

55
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,437
He spent five years
in the South African military

56
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,074
before coming to the States.

57
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,600
Physically dominant

58
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,911
with an extensive
weapons background.

59
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,237
This is Keith "the Thief."

60
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,874
Everything about him is a lie.

61
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,833
Deceptive and crafty,

62
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,033
he'll be whatever he needs
to be in order to survive.

63
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,118
I've got to show you this.
Put that down.

64
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,390
Here we go.

65
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,353
Okay, loosen up.
Up, up, loosen up.

66
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,756
Ow!

67
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,236
Ow! Fuck, man!

68
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,955
Anton also knows jujitsu.

69
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,400
Yeah, I was on tour for a while.
I was even nationally ranked.

70
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,195
I love tennis.
We should play sometime.

71
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,754
Leah doesn't
play well with others.

72
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,195
I'd crush you.

73
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,629
Banned from the tennis circuit

74
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,599
after assaulting a line judge,

75
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,320
she's extremely competitive.

76
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,876
Leah does not like to lose.

77
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,555
This is Nick.
"Iron Man" Nick.

78
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,514
Marina is bringing Nick,
the iron man.

79
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,393
He's a triathlete.

80
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,833
Very durable and just
an all-around nice guy.

81
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,269
- Oh, a triathlete.
- Yeah, that's right.

82
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,517
Nice. Ever climb the Y?

83
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,279
Oh, yeah. Three times.

84
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,358
All right.

85
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,949
Carlo, skip dinner with Cat.

86
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,197
She won't be much
for conversation.

87
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,073
Her vocal cords were crushed
in an accident

88
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,953
that killed both her parents.

89
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,392
She's a gymnast
and incredibly agile.

90
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,193
I'll get you a drink.

91
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,869
Who are you here with?

92
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,272
- Victor's date is Sarah.
- He's cute.

93
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,632
An orphan with the anxiety
disorder trichotillomania.

94
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,031
Basically,
she pulls her hair out.

95
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,879
No athletic history.

96
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,878
She probably won't
be around long.

97
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,436
She's also a bit awkward.

98
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,070
I don't really know anyone here.

99
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,840
You know me.
Jackie.

100
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,474
Sarah.

101
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,878
Let's do this!

102
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,914
Carly is bringing Mike,
"Magic Mike."

103
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,634
He's a male escort,
so I can't imagine

104
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,593
it was too hard
to get him to come.

105
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,275
And, finally,
my piece is Jackie.

106
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,597
She's the new teacher
at my yoga studio.

107
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,396
She teaches that yoga serves us
so that we may serve others.

108
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,239
You must love yourself

109
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,911
so you can spread that love
everywhere, to everyone.

110
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,839
I'm still working on that part.

111
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,474
What is this stuff?

112
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,713
It's a bottle of vintage.
You'll love it.

113
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,149
Thanks.

114
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,837
Good luck, everyone.

115
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,712
To our guests.

116
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,799
Every one of you
was invited here for a reason.

117
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,879
Now, while at first glance
those reasons are obvious...

118
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,074
Beauty, strength,
intelligence...

119
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,034
what's not quite so obvious
are the qualities

120
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,950
lurking beneath
such glowing exteriors.

121
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,436
Where better to reveal
those hidden qualities

122
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,314
than in the exciting
new arena of friendship.

123
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,079
To new friends.

124
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,954
For a night you can't remember.

125
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,994
And a day you can't forget.

126
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,673
You fascinate me, Jackie.

127
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:23,275
And I haven't felt that
in a long, long time.

128
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,316
What is this on my head?

129
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,591
Some sort of lens.

130
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,713
What did they do?

131
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,914
Good morning.

132
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,510
I hope everyone slept soundly.

133
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,717
You have a big day ahead of you.

134
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,836
What the fuck?

135
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,839
This is a game.

136
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,999
You have one night
to complete it.

137
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,272
Somewhere in this space
is a key.

138
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,080
There is also
a very special door.

139
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,030
To win the game, find the key
and unlock the door to freedom.

140
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,796
But only one of you can win.

141
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,312
What does that mean?

142
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,957
It means we're fucked.

143
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,631
Whatever.
I'm out of here.

144
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,516
Help me, assholes!

145
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,759
- Come on...
- It's welded shut.

146
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,556
The door will only open
when one survivor remains

147
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,991
and the others are all dead.

148
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,351
I'm not playing.
We're not playing.

149
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,155
You hear me?
We're not playing!

150
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,999
You can take your twisted
Hunger Game fantasy

151
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,350
somewhere else.

152
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,150
Your third eye
cameras allow us to see everything you see.

153
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,596
Do not manipulate these cameras.

154
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,998
If you obstruct or obscure
the lens in any way...

155
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,880
This is bullshit!

156
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,113
What the hell?

157
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,393
Wait, wait, wait,
what are you doing?

158
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,831
I'm taking this thing off!

159
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,235
Ah!

160
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,674
Oh, my God.

161
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,880
As you can see,

162
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:20,676
each camera contains
a vial of acid.

163
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,554
After 12 hours, the acid
will degrade those vials

164
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,151
and you will suffer
the same fate as your friend.

165
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,710
Only if you win the game
and escape

166
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,310
can the camera
be safely removed.

167
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,830
For those of you tempted
to do nothing

168
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,269
and sit the game out,

169
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,473
that is not an option.

170
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,873
The game begins...

171
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,795
now.

172
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,315
Hey, guys?

173
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,872
What should we do?

174
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,753
What do you think?

175
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,031
I'm not going to stay here
with the dead guy and the puke.

176
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,680
Betting is
open. Place your chips.

177
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,076
Kris, let's see some data.

178
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,711
This round is now closed.

179
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,551
This place is like a maze.

180
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,434
I feel like we've been
going around in circles.

181
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,436
Hey, what do you do
for a living?

182
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,637
I'm a yoga teacher.
Why?

183
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,599
And you're a climber?

184
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,314
Yeah.

185
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,795
You play tennis.

186
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,639
I'm a tennis pro.

187
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,399
Tennis pro.

188
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,910
Big guy,
you're obviously in shape.

189
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,674
What do you do?

190
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,473
Personal trainer.

191
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,479
- And you're a marathoner?
- Triathlete.

192
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,195
So we all have some sort
of physical prowess.

193
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,234
Well, I can't do a push-up
to save my life.

194
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,477
And she can barely stand up.

195
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,512
I work out.

196
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,719
Sometimes.

197
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,673
Takes a dump on your theory.

198
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,037
They're never going
to let us out of here.

199
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,715
Yeah, well, we all know
what the solution is, huh?

200
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,798
Why don't you just relax?

201
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,310
Hey, I'm relaxed, bubbles.
Why don't you relax, huh?

202
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,434
You mean we have to kill
each other?

203
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,792
No. I refuse to accept that.

204
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,555
None of it matters.

205
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,116
The only thing that matters
is that clock ticking down,

206
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,836
and this little conversation's
a fucking waste of time.

207
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,673
What the fuck?

208
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,951
That's disgusting.

209
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,559
Let's keep moving.

210
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,079
There's something in here.

211
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,519
Now what?

212
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,798
Nothing.

213
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,354
We just leave it.

214
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,876
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

215
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,514
I'm just taking a look, okay?

216
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,279
- Guys, don't.
- I'm not doing anything.

217
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,834
Yeah, that's right, you're not.

218
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,474
What are you, the boss now?

219
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,637
No, I'm just trying
to contain the situation.

220
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,240
Contain the situation?
What a douche.

221
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,080
Okay, okay, all right.
Let's just...

222
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,033
let's just move on.

223
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,469
Okay? Move on.

224
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,160
There are going to be
other weapons.

225
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,589
And we'll leave those, too,

226
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,399
and we'll work together.

227
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,195
We're not animals.

228
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,198
Can you help me out here?

229
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,312
Whatever you do,
just be sure about it.

230
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,954
What, are you
going to follow this guy?

231
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,914
Guys, this is not happening.

232
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,520
Please, just...

233
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,791
just... just think
for a second.

234
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,640
Okay. Let's think.

235
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,513
Let's group think, huh?

236
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,191
All boils down
to one simple question:

237
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,359
do you believe in this thing,
in what's going on?

238
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,029
Do you believe what's going on
around you, huh?

239
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,469
Do you believe what's going
to happen to us

240
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,831
if we don't do anything?

241
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,309
Yes or no?

242
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,640
Yeah.

243
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,794
When that meathead
had his face melt off,

244
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,480
we all knew the answer.

245
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,874
So the real question is
what are you going to do?

246
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,275
Huh?

247
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,840
I want to live.

248
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,996
We all want to live.

249
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,714
Oh, well, that's the rub.

250
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,197
Only one of us
get out of here alive.

251
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,356
No. I believe
there's another way.

252
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,318
No, you don't.

253
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,159
Listen,
what I think we should do is...

254
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,113
Shh! Shh!

255
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,076
There's two sides
to every coin, okay?

256
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,670
What we want to do
and what we don't want to do.

257
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,434
And what I don't want to do

258
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,597
is listen
to another fucking thing

259
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,956
coming out of your mouth.

260
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,519
No, no!

261
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,359
No. No, no, no, no.

262
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,676
No, no, please!
Please!

263
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,190
Oh, my God!

264
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,996
I can't believe it.

265
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,475
I can't fucking believe it.

266
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,000
Let's get out of here.

267
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,429
Run!

268
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,230
Hey...

269
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,754
Whoa.

270
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,551
Kill me later...

271
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,479
after we clean house.

272
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,909
Okay?

273
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,313
I don't want to be here.

274
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,672
I don't want to die.

275
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,239
Listen to me.
You're not going to die, okay?

276
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,874
I promise.

277
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,395
We're going to find
a way out, okay?

278
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,636
We're all going to go home.

279
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,877
I promise.

280
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,560
Hey, hey, check this out.

281
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,877
Some kind of message.

282
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,958
Like a clue?

283
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,800
Yeah, exactly like a clue.

284
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,198
It looks like a baseball.

285
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,079
Why a baseball?

286
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,471
What do you think it means?

287
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,878
It's got to mean something.

288
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,800
It must mean something.

289
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,238
Ah! Oh, my God! Nick!

290
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,833
Wow.

291
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,078
What in the...?
Huh...

292
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,591
What is this place?

293
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,949
That bitch on the P. A. Mentioned
something about a key

294
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,992
and a door.

295
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,873
I got this.

296
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,630
How do you feel about it?

297
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,071
Killing someone?

298
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,272
It happened pretty fast,
you know?

299
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,675
Are you okay?

300
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,196
I knew it meant something.

301
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,471
Oh, wow.
Uh... uh, yeah.

302
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,076
We need to get
the hell out of here.

303
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,680
Baseball.

304
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,040
No killing.

305
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,118
I'm not going to kill anyone.

306
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,357
I can't say the same
for everyone else.

307
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,870
It was you or him.

308
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,238
I just want to get
the fuck out of here.

309
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,359
How do you feel about it?

310
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,998
It was unavoidable.

311
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,800
A police badge.

312
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,400
Musical note.

313
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,319
Sunglasses.

314
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,553
Suggestions?

315
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,990
Sunglasses could mean sun.

316
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,873
Sunlight?

317
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,719
Outside?

318
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,474
Escape?

319
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,080
Why not?

320
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,680
Good job, Sarah.

321
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,437
Whatever it is,
let's just be careful.

322
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,193
It's a ruse.

323
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,550
They're trying to keep us
in one spot.

324
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,232
Yeah. Fuck!

325
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,830
Let's get the fuck out of here.

326
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,512
I don't... I don't want
to go down there.

327
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,870
I'm sure it's fine.

328
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,155
Did you see that?

329
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,199
Down this way.

330
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,953
Do you see that?

331
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,074
These lights.

332
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,159
They aren't random.
It's a pattern.

333
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,671
There's got to be something
valuable on the other side.

334
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,274
Maybe the way out.

335
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,914
How can you be so sure?

336
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,589
Because that's how
these sick bastards work.

337
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,999
Okay, so there's...

338
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,759
seven sections of the hallway.

339
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,314
I'm going to call out
which one the light falls on,

340
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,159
and you remember the sequence.

341
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,278
- I don't understand.
- You don't have to understand.

342
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,312
- But you do. You got it?
- Got it.

343
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,477
You're going to call out the
numbers, remember the sequence.

344
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,629
- Two.
- Two.

345
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,399
- Five.
- Five.

346
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,557
She's playing, man.

347
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,319
- Three.
- Three.

348
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,637
Six.

349
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,395
Less than six hours remain.

350
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,674
We've got to go.

351
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,717
I don't know what you're doing,
but we need to go right now.

352
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,877
Okay. Those sequence of numbers
I counted, what were they?

353
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,754
Two, five, three, six.

354
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,519
- You're sure?
- Yes.

355
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,791
Okay, we start with you,
and we stay in the light.

356
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,719
Everyone stand tight to me.
When I move, you move.

357
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,912
And we stay out of the dark,
no matter what.

358
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,753
Okay...

359
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,360
go.

360
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,676
Five, five, five!

361
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,910
Ah!

362
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,996
Oh, my God.

363
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,838
Three.

364
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,997
Holy shit.

365
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,399
All right.

366
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,512
We did it. We did it.

367
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,280
She totally owned
your shadow trap.

368
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,880
No one's ever done that before.

369
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,999
Are you happy about it?

370
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,919
Never said that.

371
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,396
Plah. She's filler.

372
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,876
Like the rodent and the misfit.

373
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,276
Ground meat to feed the beasts.

374
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,558
She's not a real challenger.

375
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,796
You never know.

376
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,878
Want to bet she dies next?

377
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,520
I don't bet.

378
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,677
I run the odds so you can.

379
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,078
With nothing at stake.
How convenient.

380
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,394
Like it matters if I bet or not.

381
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,796
Tell me, when was
the last time Victor won?

382
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,593
Never.

383
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,877
I've never lost.

384
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,072
That's just as important.

385
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,035
Sad, Victor.
Most play to win.

386
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,072
You play not to lose.

387
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,634
Take it easy
on the vapor spikes, cowboy.

388
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,639
Might increase your chances
of not losing.

389
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,038
I could out-spike you
any day of the week.

390
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,838
Now that is a wager
I'm willing to take.

391
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,158
You gonna let him bitch you out?

392
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,080
Come on, Vic.

393
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,035
- Let's do it.
- Fine.

394
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,914
- Yes?
- Yeah! Let's do it!

395
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,315
Which way do we go?
Huh?

396
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,431
Let's kill these fuckers.

397
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,517
Do you have any pets, Jackie?

398
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,674
I have a dog at home.

399
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,520
A Maltese.

400
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,596
She's probably wondering
where I am.

401
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,112
We need to go home now, Jackie.

402
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,551
I know, Sarah.

403
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,553
We're going to figure
something out.

404
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,794
I promise.

405
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,751
Why did they do this to us?

406
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,076
Because...

407
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,919
Because we're not like them.

408
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,114
We're good people.

409
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,193
Some people...

410
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,957
are just empty inside.

411
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,757
They don't feel anything.

412
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,480
For anyone.

413
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,837
I believe we're all born good.

414
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,753
Somewhere along the way...

415
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,115
...something turned them
into monsters.

416
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,997
What's your story, Nick?

417
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,270
Parents?

418
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,592
They died a long time ago.

419
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,957
Sarah, how about you?

420
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,310
No.

421
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,670
I haven't talked
to my family in a long time.

422
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,876
I bet everyone here
is just like us.

423
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,232
No family.

424
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,794
Unattached.

425
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,959
Alone.

426
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,595
A bunch of lost souls.

427
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,990
Let's go.

428
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,393
Someone will come
looking for us.

429
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,798
Who?

430
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,434
And even if they did...

431
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,433
they're probably not in time.

432
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,279
They're watching us,
aren't they?

433
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,275
Probably.

434
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,833
It's okay.

435
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,317
Getting in the mood, are we?

436
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,077
It's a shame she has to die.

437
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,317
I wonder who's going
to kill her.

438
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,638
You think it's going
to be her, don't you?

439
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,759
Well, thanks for the tip.

440
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,753
That doesn't look good.

441
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,919
Flashlight?

442
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,558
Wait, let me see.

443
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,833
A key.

444
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,553
It's phosphorescent paint.

445
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,036
Black light.

446
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,313
It just ends.

447
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,554
There it is.

448
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,719
Who's going up there?

449
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,797
We don't have time for this.

450
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,158
Let's go.

451
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,320
Kris's girl
is going to get the key...

452
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,557
unless she falls
in the hole first.

453
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,559
Jackie, careful.

454
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,319
- Jackie, please be careful.
- I see it.

455
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,471
Don't look down.

456
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:33,716
Shh.

457
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,195
Can you hear that?

458
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,478
- They there.
- Shh.

459
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,000
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

460
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,634
Be careful.

461
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,194
Come on.

462
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,551
Let's go say hello.

463
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,070
Looks like we're
going to get a fight.

464
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,356
I got it. I got it.

465
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,835
Whoa, good job.

466
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,272
Nick!

467
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,679
I got it. I got it.

468
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:23,990
I got this.

469
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,916
Okay, come on.

470
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,594
Come on.

471
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,951
Sarah, climb up here.
You'll be safe with me.

472
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,157
Come on, get it!

473
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,317
I'm going to kill you!
You give me that key!

474
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,673
Bring it, boy!

475
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,314
Sarah?

476
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,436
Get to fucking you up. Come on!

477
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,954
Sarah...

478
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,759
don't look down, okay?

479
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,320
Just come to me.

480
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:17,670
Sarah.

481
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,957
It's Sarah, right?
Come here.

482
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,276
Come to me.

483
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,709
Give me your hand
and you'll be safe.

484
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,792
Don't listen to a word she says.

485
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,878
It's not safe out there.

486
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,470
You know I'm right.
Just look down.

487
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,598
Don't listen to her, Sarah.

488
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,315
Don't listen to her.

489
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,074
The fall will kill you, Sarah.

490
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,397
Please, just make
your way towards me, Sarah.

491
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,831
- You don't want to die, do you?
- I'm here for you.

492
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,918
- I'll protect you.
- I'll help you get out of here.

493
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,919
Give me the key
and I'll let you live.

494
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,280
I can help you get out of here.

495
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,119
- Please come to me.
- Give me the key!

496
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,754
I'll protect you, Sarah.

497
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,635
I just want to go home.

498
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,833
I just want to go home.

499
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,552
- No!
- Fuck!

500
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:16,750
No!

501
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,233
Keith, go get the key!

502
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,153
Jackie!

503
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,194
Let go.

504
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,517
It's over.

505
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:40,995
You bitch!

506
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,520
You fucking bitch.

507
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,715
Oh, my God.

508
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,440
Jackie!

509
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,277
Say hi to Sarah for me.

510
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,353
No!

511
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,670
Fuck.

512
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:37,799
Help me, please.

513
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,320
Please.

514
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,557
Help.

515
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,479
Help me, please.

516
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,794
Where is the key?

517
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,118
I haven't found the goddamn key.

518
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,430
Well, let's find it.

519
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,639
There's no key.

520
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,116
The other chick
must have got here first.

521
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,750
Well, let's get them.

522
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:58,429
How come you didn't
get here first?

523
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,320
I didn't come this way.

524
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,830
Bullshit. I took the same
staircase you did.

525
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,436
It practically
led me right here.

526
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:07,869
How could you miss it?

527
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,279
You're hiding something.

528
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:21,199
Where's the key?

529
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,119
I don't have it.

530
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,913
Bullshit.

531
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,156
I don't have it.

532
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,511
Then who does?

533
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,632
I told you, that quiet bitch.

534
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,832
Hmm.

535
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,997
She took the other staircase,

536
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,271
which clearly doesn't lead here.

537
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,758
You're lying.

538
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,440
Search him.

539
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,871
What the fuck is this?

540
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,754
I found it.

541
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,314
I found it in the barrel.

542
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,112
What were you
gonna do with that, huh?

543
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,118
Stab us in the back?

544
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,549
Hmm?

545
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,914
So you don't have the key?

546
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,440
No.

547
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,279
And you don't know who does?

548
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,596
No, I swear.

549
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,997
Then you're useless to us.

550
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,398
You silly little bitch!

551
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,069
She's alive.
She's fucking alive?

552
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,035
You.

553
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,392
I don't want to fight you.

554
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,072
I don't understand.

555
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,760
Nick.
Have you seen Nick?

556
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,199
Okay, let's...
let's find him.

557
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,190
Together.

558
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,991
That's hot.

559
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,237
Let's make it a little hotter.

560
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,791
You smell that?

561
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,320
Gasoline.

562
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:18,910
Uh-uh.
Don't move!

563
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,396
You're hurt.
Let us help you.

564
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:24,670
Shut up.

565
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:30,235
You think losers like us
were brought here to win?

566
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,070
We're meant to die.

567
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,232
Entertainment
for the asshole overlords

568
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:39,592
while contenders like her
fight it out.

569
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,594
We're sideshow freaks.

570
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,636
We're intermission.

571
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,473
This isn't you.

572
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:50,830
You don't have to do this.

573
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,919
You and your
"glass half full" bullshit.

574
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:55,918
You don't know me.

575
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:58,112
My glass...

576
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:59,640
my glass is full of blood.

577
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,071
There it is.

578
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:13,993
The door, we found it.

579
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,678
- It's locked.
- Oh, come on.

580
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,234
Now what?

581
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,877
Let them come to us.

582
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,837
- Okay, sit here.
- It's okay.

583
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,554
Shh, just let me take a look.

584
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:44,316
Oh.

585
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,756
You going to look around?

586
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,111
Okay. Be careful.

587
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:51,113
And don't leave without us.

588
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,751
What are you doing?

589
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,036
I'm going to re-dress it.

590
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,230
Okay.

591
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:14,999
Sorry.

592
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,513
I see you picked up a stray.

593
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,634
You trust her?

594
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,077
She's just like us.

595
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,192
Scared and wants to get
out of here alive.

596
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,477
Okay.

597
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:30,875
Okay.

598
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,673
It's not much, but...

599
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:33,916
...it'll help.

600
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,396
It's perfect. Thanks.

601
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,039
You saved my life.

602
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,037
And you took one.

603
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:06,996
Yeah.

604
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:13,599
I just ran as fast as I could.

605
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,076
Almost on time.

606
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,710
But I knew in that split second
I had a choice to make.

607
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,071
Kill him, or let you die.

608
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,518
And I'm not going
to let you die.

609
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:12,240
Come on.

610
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,630
If that's the door,

611
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:30,354
they still need the key.

612
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,916
They're waiting us out.

613
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:44,396
Okay, look,
Anton is the main threat.

614
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,920
So you draw him towards me,

615
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,440
keep the key away from him,

616
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,239
and I'll do the dirty work.

617
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,592
She thinks I'm dead.
Let's use that to our advantage.

618
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:54,120
How?

619
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:56,915
I need you to take
your clothes off.

620
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:08,229
You wait here in case
he circles back around.

621
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:33,157
Still alive, Jackie?

622
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:35,840
That's too bad.

623
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:44,840
You?

624
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:27,069
Now!

625
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:32,676
Nick!

626
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:43,953
Nick.

627
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:46,876
Nick.

628
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:48,799
We have to go.
Come on.

629
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,275
You're going to be okay.

630
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,676
We're gonna get out of here.
I swear, Nick.

631
01:04:58,880 --> 01:04:59,711
Come on.

632
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,836
Somebody do something!

633
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:11,635
Please, no, no.

634
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:43,631
Player termination.

635
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:45,797
Down to our final three players.

636
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,473
Going somewhere?

637
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,517
I'm not going anywhere.

638
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,671
I don't think any of us are.

639
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:11,310
One...

640
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:19,352
The door will only open
when one survivor remains.

641
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:27,400
You have to kill me.

642
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,159
No, I can't.
I can't do that.

643
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:31,317
I wouldn't do that.

644
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:34,274
I'm dying.

645
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:36,915
So just save yourself.

646
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:38,679
Please.

647
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:42,237
Nick... I can't.

648
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:44,352
I don't want to do that.
I can't do that.

649
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,313
You can't let both of us die.

650
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,079
They'll win.

651
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:50,237
Don't let it happen.

652
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:51,914
So just do it.

653
01:08:57,360 --> 01:08:58,680
Go on.

654
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,989
Let me figure something out.
I'm gonna figure something out.

655
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,679
Wait...

656
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:26,835
Time is running out, Jackie.

657
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:29,710
Please.

658
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,438
We did it.

659
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:55,835
We did it.

660
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:03,712
What did you do?

661
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,718
What did you do?

662
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:07,320
No.

663
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:13,110
All right, it's okay.

664
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:14,674
It's okay. It's okay.

665
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:16,030
It's okay. It's okay.
It's over.

666
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:17,754
It's over. It's over.

667
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,229
It's over.

668
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:20,476
It's over. You won.

669
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:22,319
You won. You won.
You won.

670
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:24,193
I can't... I can't...

671
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:25,993
I can't...

672
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:34,113
Quite the surprise.

673
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,517
Better luck next time, Carlo.

674
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:04,669
Shh. It's okay. Relax.

675
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,553
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.

676
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,240
Where am I?

677
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:12,840
You're safe.

678
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:15,157
Don't fucking touch me!

679
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:27,639
You're safe now.

680
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,838
You've been reborn.

681
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:33,236
You're free to do
whatever you want to do,

682
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:34,954
be whoever you want to be.

683
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:39,232
How could you do this to me?

684
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:45,034
Who are you?

685
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:54,549
Everyone brings a piece
to the game.

686
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:00,274
You were mine.

687
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:03,070
Are you game?

688
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:06,680
Yeah...

689
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:08,149
I'm game.

690
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:24,391
I'm just like you.

691
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:27,314
We're all just like you.

692
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:28,914
You're one of us now.

693
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:32,438
What do you mean, "one of us"?

694
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:37,277
You might not remember.

695
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,840
You were initiated, Jackie.

696
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:46,116
We have rules in this game.

697
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:48,915
And our loser must die...

698
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:55,074
Help! Somebody!

699
01:14:57,680 --> 01:14:59,558
...at the hands of the winner.

700
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:03,437
Help me!

701
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:05,000
Help!

702
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:06,839
Somebody, help me!

703
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,918
This feeling is natural.

704
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,918
- Help me!
- It'll pass.

705
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:14,870
Help me!

706
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:34,071
If you want to go...

707
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:36,920
go.

708
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:38,873
We're not going to stop you.

709
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:42,676
But there's something
you should know.

710
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:44,314
Your roommate.

711
01:15:58,040 --> 01:15:59,394
They haven't found the killer.

712
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:13,791
But they're looking.

713
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:17,200
That's your name, right?

714
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:21,873
They're looking for you.

715
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:26,152
Your prints were all over it.

716
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:31,758
And you haven't been seen since.

717
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:34,953
So if you want to go...

718
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,359
By all means.

719
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,917
Quite the game.

720
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:18,998
You were watching?

721
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:20,714
We always are.

722
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:23,196
You know that, Kris.

723
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:26,635
Did you win?

724
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:27,876
No.

725
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:31,517
But I didn't lose.

726
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:33,234
Drink?

727
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,511
I'm here about the girl.

728
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:36,995
She's recovering.

729
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,356
Not as quickly
as some of the others.

730
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:47,313
She'll be well soon enough.

731
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:51,594
Will she?

732
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:55,157
I've never seen someone
like her win before.

733
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:59,991
She inspired hope
where there was none.

734
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:01,953
She outsmarted
and she outfought.

735
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:03,719
She was a sheep...

736
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:05,752
meant to die.

737
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:09,357
But she didn't.

738
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:10,789
She won.

739
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:16,397
She's not like the others, Kris.

740
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:21,353
And we're not convinced that
she'll become a team player.

741
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:24,917
So we want her dealt with
immediately.

742
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:26,873
What?

743
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:29,436
You can't do that.

744
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:31,831
She won the game. She's worthy.
She's more than worthy.

745
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:35,353
I'm absolutely sure of it.

746
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:39,600
But we're not.

747
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:43,511
And that's all that matters.

748
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:52,392
Are you familiar with the term
"adelphophagy," Kris?

749
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:57,480
It literally means
"to eat one's brother."

750
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:01,313
Sand sharks.

751
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,159
They do this in the womb.

752
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,236
Devour their siblings

753
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:10,080
so they grow strong enough
to survive in the wild.

754
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:16,076
The dominant shark,
there is no instinct

755
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:19,398
to help or to hope.

756
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,356
Only to kill or to be killed.

757
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,153
And that instinct...

758
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:31,678
starts before they're even born.

759
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:38,869
Please.

760
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:41,640
Please.

761
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:43,678
Ask the elders to reconsider.

762
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:47,560
In all my time
running this game,

763
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:49,792
I have never asked them
for anything.

764
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,720
I believe I've earned
their trust.

765
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:55,037
She will come around,
and when she does,

766
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:57,038
she will be special.

767
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:59,152
We need someone like her.

768
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:00,840
We need?

769
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:03,715
Or you need?

770
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:09,992
Both.

771
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:18,679
She will be your responsibility
from now on, son.

772
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:27,794
If she is to stay...

773
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:31,559
she will be the one...

774
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:40,073
to cut the dead weight
from our ranks.

775
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:45,920
The game...

776
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:51,032
how did it start?

777
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:52,117
That...

778
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:58,436
is a very long and old story.

779
01:22:58,640 --> 01:22:59,710
But...

780
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,479
I can tell you
how it started for me.

781
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:06,434
It started with a feeling.

782
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:08,836
This intense feeling of...

783
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:12,679
being alive...

784
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,398
for the first time.

785
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:26,680
I think ever since then,
I've been chasing after that.

786
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:31,356
Then why don't you bet?

787
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:35,634
Because I run the game.

788
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:38,794
They say it's quite an honor.

789
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,276
They say a lot of things.

790
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:44,200
But don't worry about me.

791
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:46,232
You get to bet.

792
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:48,591
Just make sure you don't lose.

793
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:53,194
I'd rather help you
run the game.

794
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:57,592
I mean, if it's okay
with the others.

795
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:01,151
It's okay because
I say it's okay.

796
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:03,352
I can't tell you
how happy that makes me.

797
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:09,000
In fact...

798
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:12,440
that calls for a drink.

799
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,752
Uh... but last time...

800
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:19,038
Trust me.

801
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:32,679
It's okay.

802
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:33,956
It'll pass.

803
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:36,914
I want you here with me.

804
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:39,077
It doesn't do anything
for me anymore.

805
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:42,114
I wish it did.

806
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:43,959
I miss it.

807
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,958
Well, what does?

808
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:48,356
Come on, I want you to...

809
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:50,592
I want you to feel what I feel.

810
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:01,954
You mix this.

811
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:06,115
Three parts vodka to one part.

812
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:09,280
For the game.

813
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:11,517
But this...

814
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:13,074
is the real deal.

815
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:17,510
Pure.

816
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,432
I forgot how that feels.

817
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:06,517
For a night
you can't remember...

818
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:10,318
and a day you can't forget.

819
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:25,679
Good morning.

820
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:28,799
I hope everyone
got a good night's rest.

821
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:33,719
Kris? Kris?

822
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:35,877
Unfortunately,

823
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:39,960
your time here is running out.

824
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:42,152
Enjoy your last 90 seconds

825
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:44,790
on this earth.

826
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,070
This is not a game.

827
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:48,437
Please don't.

828
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:51,394
There is no magic key.

829
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,752
There is no special door
for you to find.

830
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:56,872
There is no winner.

831
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:59,589
There is no escape.

832
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:33,676
Well...

833
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:34,916
that was...

834
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:37,038
Unavoidable.

835
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:39,994
How do you feel, Jackie?

836
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:46,674
Alive.

837
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:50,355
So now what?

838
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:52,552
Well, that's up to you.

839
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:19,913
This is endgame.

840
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:22,629
And it ends...

841
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:28,913
...now.
