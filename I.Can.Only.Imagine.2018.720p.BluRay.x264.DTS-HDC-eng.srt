00:32:05,233 --> 00:32:07,032
'cause you're gonna have
to support yourself

477
00:32:07,034 --> 00:32:08,568
one of these days.
How do you even know?

478
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:10,904
You've never even heard me sing.

479
00:32:10,906 --> 00:32:12,571
Well, that's not my fault.

480
00:32:12,573 --> 00:32:15,274
All I hear out of you
is whining and moaning.

481
00:32:15,276 --> 00:32:19,378
Okay. I'm singing
this morning at church.

482
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,548
10:00 on radio AM 1080.

483
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,582
Why don't you come watch me sing?
No, I can't do that.

484
00:32:23,584 --> 00:32:25,585
Why not?
No. I just don't belong there.

485
00:32:25,587 --> 00:32:27,923
Why?
I just don't. I don't!

486
00:32:29,925 --> 00:32:31,858
Don't belong there.

487
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,062
Okay.

488
00:32:39,367 --> 00:32:41,166
(IMITATING VOICE)
My boy Bart's, oh,

489
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:43,136
he's nothin'
but a big disappointment.

490
00:32:43,138 --> 00:32:45,972
I wish he'd never been born.
Everything'd been just fine.

491
00:32:45,974 --> 00:32:48,073
Hey...
All my problems are because of Bart.

492
00:32:48,075 --> 00:32:49,474
Hey, hey,
you put words in my mouth.

493
00:32:49,476 --> 00:32:51,043
I'm gonna put a fist
in your face.

494
00:32:51,045 --> 00:32:52,878
Yeah, I'm a little big
for that, Dad.

495
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,414
You think?
I think those days are over.

496
00:32:54,416 --> 00:32:56,348
Is that what you think?
Yeah! I do, yeah!

497
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,217
Listen, you have
to talk to me with respect.

498
00:32:58,219 --> 00:33:00,286
I'm the one that puts
the food on the table.

499
00:33:00,288 --> 00:33:02,422
I earn the living around here,
and I'm the one who stayed.

500
00:33:02,424 --> 00:33:04,190
I don't see your Momma anywhere.

501
00:33:04,192 --> 00:33:05,925
Yeah, well, nobody blames
her for leaving, Dad!

502
00:33:05,927 --> 00:33:06,727
I would've left, too!

503
00:33:10,165 --> 00:33:12,298
Just shut up.
Just shut up and eat.

504
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,000
I'm not hungry.
Eat your food.

505
00:33:14,002 --> 00:33:15,303
I'm not hungry!

506
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:20,876
All right, then.

507
00:33:27,916 --> 00:33:32,085
You kidding me?!
Stay away from me!

508
00:33:32,087 --> 00:33:34,385
I'm serious!
Don't touch me!

509
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:38,327
I'm done with you! You're crazy!
Get away from me!

510
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:18,498
Bart, what happened
to your head?

511
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,333
It's bleeding.

512
00:34:20,335 --> 00:34:22,101
Oh, it's nothing, it's fine.
Are you okay?

513
00:34:22,103 --> 00:34:23,539
Are you sure?
I'm fine

514
00:34:25,706 --> 00:34:27,373
SHANNON: I'm wondering
if you guys could all

515
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:29,275
maybe pray for a friend of mine?

516
00:34:29,277 --> 00:34:33,279
This friend I think is lying
to me about their life.

517
00:34:33,281 --> 00:34:35,581
I don't know what to do
because I wanna help,

518
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:37,650
and they just won't let me,
and I just feel like

519
00:34:37,652 --> 00:34:41,386
the more I try,
it kind of gets worse and worse.

520
00:34:41,388 --> 00:34:45,027
And so now when I look at them,
all I see is a mask.

521
00:34:46,328 --> 00:34:48,460
Pray for them.

522
00:34:48,462 --> 00:34:52,331
No one can live a lie forever,
okay?

523
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:54,099
Okay, thanks.

524
00:34:54,101 --> 00:34:55,735
BART: Course they know
you're talking about me.

525
00:34:55,737 --> 00:34:57,503
Do you know how embarrassing
that is?

526
00:34:57,505 --> 00:34:59,639
I was just trying
to get you to listen!

527
00:34:59,641 --> 00:35:01,239
What is going on with you?!

528
00:35:01,241 --> 00:35:04,076
I'm fine.
You're not fine!

529
00:35:04,078 --> 00:35:06,045
Is it your dad?
I could help.

530
00:35:06,047 --> 00:35:09,014
Just let me come over.
I don't want you at my house.

531
00:35:09,016 --> 00:35:11,217
Why?
'Cause I just don't.

532
00:35:11,219 --> 00:35:13,018
Where is this coming from?

533
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,020
I don't know, maybe from deep
inside my mask.

534
00:35:15,022 --> 00:35:16,723
That's not funny.
It's kinda funny.

535
00:35:16,725 --> 00:35:18,523
Please, don't do this.
You got me all figured out.

536
00:35:18,525 --> 00:35:21,127
You push everyone away!
Don't add me to that list.

537
00:35:21,129 --> 00:35:22,628
I love you.
I've always loved you!

538
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,500
Yeah, well,
I've never really loved you.

539
00:35:27,067 --> 00:35:29,101
I mean, we're...
we're graduating soon.

540
00:35:29,103 --> 00:35:31,103
You're going off to college.
I'm chasing some stupid dream.

541
00:35:31,105 --> 00:35:33,172
Right?
I never said your dream was stupid.

542
00:35:33,174 --> 00:35:35,241
I mean, this has been fun.
No regrets for me, all right?

543
00:35:35,243 --> 00:35:36,742
But people change,
you know what I mean?

544
00:35:36,744 --> 00:35:38,677
We obviously can't
get along anymore.

545
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:42,618
I'm leaving, Shannon.
After graduation I'm... I'm gone.

546
00:35:48,589 --> 00:35:50,623
SHANNON: Please don't.

547
00:35:50,625 --> 00:35:53,358
BART: What?

548
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,460
SHANNON: Go.

549
00:35:55,462 --> 00:35:57,498
BART: I can't stay here, Shannon.

550
00:36:25,726 --> 00:36:28,161
MAN: You know, Mike,
it's amazing how people quit

551
00:36:28,163 --> 00:36:31,163
when they don't get paid.
MAN: Look, we are opening

552
00:36:31,165 --> 00:36:33,632
for the opening act
at a youth conference.

553
00:36:33,634 --> 00:36:35,835
It's impossible,
that's the whole problem.

554
00:36:35,837 --> 00:36:38,570
"Whether you think you can
or you think you can't,

555
00:36:38,572 --> 00:36:40,639
you're right"...
that's Confucius.

556
00:36:40,641 --> 00:36:42,340
I don't even know
what that means.

557
00:36:42,342 --> 00:36:44,143
And it's offensive to me
as an artist.

558
00:36:44,145 --> 00:36:46,244
An artist?
We're making 90 bucks!

559
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:47,646
Right.
Between the three of us.

560
00:36:47,648 --> 00:36:49,648
We have no vocals.
We got no show.

561
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,583
It's impossible.

562
00:36:51,585 --> 00:36:53,686
BASSIST: Yeah, well, the
only impossible things

563
00:36:53,688 --> 00:36:55,420
are the things
that we call impossible.

564
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:56,855
What is that? Aristotle?

565
00:36:56,857 --> 00:36:59,525
No, that one's a fortune cookie.

566
00:36:59,527 --> 00:37:02,161
Nathan,
nobody understands you, man!

567
00:37:02,163 --> 00:37:03,728
Hey, guys.
You're always so cranky, man.

568
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:05,331
Yeah, since Des Moines.
Oh, Des Moines.

569
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:07,232
Why bring up Des Moines again?

570
00:37:07,234 --> 00:37:09,634
Hey, guys, if you guys
need a singer, I'll sing.

571
00:37:09,636 --> 00:37:12,737
I'm, uh... (CHUCKLES)
I also patch cables,

572
00:37:12,739 --> 00:37:14,739
and, you know,
I can run the board,

573
00:37:14,741 --> 00:37:20,212
and turn the lights on,
and I write songs, too.

574
00:37:20,214 --> 00:37:21,482
Kind of. Sometimes.

that's all the songs we got.

WOMAN: Encore!

612
00:39:12,326 --> 00:39:13,793
You know what?

613
00:39:13,795 --> 00:39:15,494
Let me tell you a story
before we go.

614
00:39:15,496 --> 00:39:19,998
Um... 'cause when I was, uh...

615
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,802
ten, 11 years old,
life was tough.

616
00:39:23,804 --> 00:39:26,639
I mean, it...
it was real tough, actually.

617
00:39:26,641 --> 00:39:29,641
I needed something,
and I remember, I've...

618
00:39:29,643 --> 00:39:32,677
I've always loved music,
you know?

619
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:37,016
And I found some songs
that I just...

620
00:39:37,018 --> 00:39:41,353
man, I... I held onto,
you know what I mean?

621
00:39:41,355 --> 00:39:44,889
Like an anchor in a storm.
And they got me through.

622
00:39:44,891 --> 00:39:48,960
And they told me about
a Father in heaven that...

623
00:39:48,962 --> 00:39:50,730
that wanted me.

624
00:39:50,732 --> 00:39:54,567
You know,
a Father that loves me so much

625
00:39:54,569 --> 00:39:57,503
that He died for me.

626
00:39:57,505 --> 00:39:59,337
A Father
that would never leave me.

627
00:39:59,339 --> 00:40:01,974
And I listened to these songs
over and over

628
00:40:01,976 --> 00:40:06,378
and over and over again and...
and they gave me hope.

'Cause I wrote him a letter

655
00:42:06,833 --> 00:42:08,666
every week
for the past two years.

Uh, it's Bart.

665
00:42:35,929 --> 00:42:38,531
Sorry. And what's the name
of your band again?

666
00:42:38,533 --> 00:42:41,800
It's MercyMe, you know,
'cause when I told my memaw

667
00:42:41,802 --> 00:42:43,668
that we were starting a band,
she was, like,

668
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:45,637
"Mercy me, get a real job."

669
00:42:45,639 --> 00:42:47,540
And I was, like,
"Aw, Memaw!" (LAUGHS)

670
00:42:47,542 --> 00:42:49,741
And then the guys were like,
"Did she really say that?"

671
00:42:49,743 --> 00:42:52,545
I was, like, "Yeah, we
have to name the band Mercy..."

672
00:42:52,547 --> 00:42:55,114
So that's what we called it.

673
00:42:55,116 --> 00:42:57,215
Son, the sheer volume of words

674
00:42:57,217 --> 00:43:00,654
that comes outta your mouth
is... exhausting.

you've found your song,

00:43:13,835 --> 00:43:15,537
Found your soul,
you know what I'm saying?

679
00:43:18,572 --> 00:43:23,007
Look, that last thing you did,
that was... that was special.

680
00:43:23,009 --> 00:43:26,712
Next gig, you should do that
the whole time, the entire show.

That's not the kind of music
that we sing, though.

683
00:43:30,618 --> 00:43:33,152
Trust me, son, you have no idea
what kind of music you sing.

684
00:43:33,154 --> 00:43:35,221
We write our own music.
We don't just do covers.

685
00:43:35,223 --> 00:43:37,590
Well, then write
something like that,

686

No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

00:49:08,489 --> 00:49:11,956
we're playing this, uh,
big showcase tomorrow,

786
00:49:11,958 --> 00:49:15,027
and, uh, it's a big deal for us,

787
00:49:15,029 --> 00:49:17,429
and we just, uh... we're ready.

788
00:49:17,431 --> 00:49:22,103
But we're a...
touch frightened too, um...

789
00:49:24,371 --> 00:49:28,373
I guess that's it.
Just wanted to tell you that.

790
00:49:28,375 --> 00:49:29,344
Uh...

791
00:49:52,199 --> 00:49:54,099
Little off-Broadway,
I know, but it's the best

792
00:49:54,101 --> 00:49:55,967
I could do on short notice.
Are you kidding me?

793
00:49:55,969 --> 00:49:57,869
This is perfect.

794
00:49:57,871 --> 00:49:59,871
Oh, and, guys,
this is your sound man, Dingo.

795
00:49:59,873 --> 00:50:02,040
Anything you need,
you just let him know.

796
00:50:02,042 --> 00:50:03,976
You got us a sound guy?
(GRUNTS)

797
00:50:03,978 --> 00:50:05,978
Did you get a label to come?

798
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:07,980
No.

799
00:50:07,982 --> 00:50:11,183
I got five.
Working on a few more.

800
00:50:11,185 --> 00:50:14,322
I just need you to make sure
this place is full.

801
00:50:17,891 --> 00:50:19,891
And bring the rain, gentlemen.

802
00:50:19,893 --> 00:50:21,392
Yeah you got it.
Absolutely.

803

(CROWD CHATTERING IN BACKGROUND)

804

Buddy, you ready for this?

805
00:50:37,011 --> 00:50:38,146
BRICKELL: Good crowd, huh?

806
00:50:40,413 --> 00:50:43,014
Bart, we've got
a little situation

807
00:50:43,016 --> 00:50:45,018
I need to talk to you about.

808
00:50:47,121 --> 00:50:48,356
Come on.

809
00:50:51,458 --> 00:50:53,925
So, Bart, there's somebody
I want you to meet.

810
00:50:53,927 --> 00:50:55,293
This is a friend of mine.

811
00:50:55,295 --> 00:50:57,029
He came down here tonight
to see us.

812
00:50:57,031 --> 00:50:58,529
Whoa, Smitty?!
This is Michael W. Smith.

813
00:50:58,531 --> 00:51:00,666
(LAUGHS) Smitty, right?

814
00:51:00,668 --> 00:51:02,634
That's what your friends
call you, right?

815
00:51:02,636 --> 00:51:04,469
Yeah, yeah, uh,
nice to meet you.

816
00:51:04,471 --> 00:51:08,473
I am, like, a huge fan
from, like, all the...

817
00:51:08,475 --> 00:51:10,074
sorry, like, That's okay, man.

818
00:51:10,076 --> 00:51:11,576
All the way back.
Way back.

819
00:51:11,578 --> 00:51:14,679
Your tour with was just
so inspiring for me.

820
00:51:14,681 --> 00:51:17,148
I remember you wore
that vest, that red vest!

821
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:20,052
Dude, that was bold.
I don't think I wore a red vest.

822
00:51:20,054 --> 00:51:21,485
I would buy that vest.
No, you did.

823
00:51:21,487 --> 00:51:23,721
You wore this red vest.
You remember?

824
00:51:23,723 --> 00:51:26,291
Di... did I wear a red vest
on our tour?

825
00:51:26,293 --> 00:51:27,458
He did.
WOMAN: Yes, you did.

826
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:29,728
It was velvet.
(GASPS)

827
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:31,529
Oh, man.

828
00:51:31,531 --> 00:51:33,230
What?

829
00:51:33,232 --> 00:51:36,303
Miss Bart, I'm...
oh, we're... okay.

830
00:51:40,074 --> 00:51:41,476
Uh...

831
00:51:43,344 --> 00:51:45,610
You okay?
I just threw up a little bit.

832
00:51:45,612 --> 00:51:48,980
Yeah. No, I'm good.
I just... you are like...

833
00:51:48,982 --> 00:51:52,049
The first Christian tape
I ever got was "Never Alone."

834
00:51:52,051 --> 00:51:56,288
And it was like...
like an anchor for me.

835
00:51:56,290 --> 00:51:58,090
Thank you so much.
That means so much to me.

836
00:51:58,092 --> 00:52:00,525
Yeah, it was just...
It was... it was great.

837
00:52:00,527 --> 00:52:02,127
There you are.

838
00:52:02,129 --> 00:52:04,029
We're just so excited
to cheer you on.

Go get him, please.

Here's Amy Grant!
You are like a super hero...

We gotta roll. Sorry.
What, we're hanging out.

842
00:52:09,737 --> 00:52:11,703
Hi, guys.
This is Mike.

843
00:52:11,705 --> 00:52:15,406
Hey. Good luck, Bart.
Yeah, good... have a good one.

844
00:52:15,408 --> 00:52:17,442
Did you see who that was?
I did.

845
00:52:17,444 --> 00:52:20,112
That was Amy Grant.
She talked to me.

Whoo! What's up GMA?

Are you guys ready
to rock tonight?

Man, we are so glad
to be here with you!

Ever feel like everything
in your life

is just building and building
and building to one big moment?

That's how we feel tonight!
Let's do this!

Whoo!

857
00:53:23,576 --> 00:53:27,279
Bart.
You're stressing me out, man.

858
00:53:27,281 --> 00:53:31,549
Sorry.
It's nerves, you know.

859
00:53:31,551 --> 00:53:33,653
I wish they'd hurry up.

860
00:53:35,855 --> 00:53:37,755
I thought it was good, right?
It felt good.

861
00:53:37,757 --> 00:53:39,724
It was good.
It was good, man.

862
00:53:39,726 --> 00:53:42,330
Best show we ever played.
Crowd was into it, man.

863
00:53:44,431 --> 00:53:46,665
I'm gonna go talk to them.
No! Hey! Hey!

864
00:53:46,667 --> 00:53:49,366
Don't do that, Bart!
Brickell's got it.

865
00:53:49,368 --> 00:53:51,369
Let him do his job.

What if he can't?

Hey!
Wait! Wait!

868
00:54:02,148 --> 00:54:04,215
Dude, no!
That's a mistake.

869
00:54:04,217 --> 00:54:06,617
But if you could see
how far they've come from

870

Nice to meet y'all.

from these guys,

Don't y'all agree? I think we're
pretty much finished up here anyway.

Ah, come on,
I wanna know what you think!

Let me, let me finish up here...
I want to know what they think.

I'm sorry to have to be
the one tell you this, kid,

but, um...
you're just not good enough.

Not yet, anyway.

Seventh graders at youth camp,
that's one thing, Bart.

888
00:55:04,877 --> 00:55:06,811
But this,
this is about record sales.

889
00:55:06,813 --> 00:55:08,547
And I just can't sell
what you're doing up there.

Seventh gr...
we packed the house, man.

891
00:55:10,817 --> 00:55:12,784
We've been selling our
own albums for years now.

892
00:55:12,786 --> 00:55:16,554
I mean, what... what world
are you guys living in?

893

MAN: Reality.

894

Look, you need to embrace
reality, Bart.

895

Your stuff...

896
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:27,799
You're not good enough, Bart.
Dreams don't pay the bills.

897
00:55:27,801 --> 00:55:30,569
All it does...

898
00:55:30,571 --> 00:55:34,306
is keep you from all this...

899
00:55:34,308 --> 00:55:36,974
from knowing what's real.

900
00:55:36,976 --> 00:55:38,643
What about the stuff
we played at the end?

901
00:55:38,645 --> 00:55:40,410
The worship music?

902
00:55:40,413 --> 00:55:41,913
Oh, it was beautiful,
magical, truly.

903
00:55:41,915 --> 00:55:43,447
I've got a brother-in-law
in Denver.

He's looking for
a worship pastor.

905
00:55:45,252 --> 00:55:47,319
I could put you two together.
Is she serious?

906
00:55:47,321 --> 00:55:49,887
It's the truth you're mad at,
not me.

907
00:55:49,889 --> 00:55:52,324
My high school football team,
there were a couple of guys

908
00:55:52,326 --> 00:55:55,293
that were good enough to make
a big noise in a small town.

909
00:55:55,295 --> 00:55:56,994
<i>But that was it.
You know what?</i>

910
00:55:56,996 --> 00:55:59,563
<i>They're still there.
They're stuck.</i>

911
00:55:59,565 --> 00:56:01,732
<i>And that's what'll happen
to you.</i>

912
00:56:01,734 --> 00:56:03,668
You gotta be good at something we can sell.
Just stop!

913
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:05,337
Do you guys not get it?

914
00:56:05,339 --> 00:56:07,403
We've given everything
for this moment.

915
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:09,340
There is no plan B for us.
We will do whatever it takes.

916
00:56:09,342 --> 00:56:11,408
We will work harder
than anybody else.

917
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:13,445
Tell me what you need me to do.
I work with a lot of bands,

918
00:56:13,447 --> 00:56:16,715
and I can recognize who's
gonna make it and who isn't.

919
00:56:16,717 --> 00:56:20,351
And I gotta tell you the truth,
Bart you won't.

920
00:56:20,353 --> 00:56:22,487
How dare you say that?
You don't even know me.

921
00:56:22,489 --> 00:56:26,023
Go home.
That's what you should do.

922
00:56:26,025 --> 00:56:27,759
<i>Dad, I can do this.
No, you can't.</i>

923
00:56:27,761 --> 00:56:29,427
I can do this!
No, you can't!

924
00:56:29,429 --> 00:56:30,929
And you're gonna blink
your eyes,

925
00:56:30,931 --> 00:56:33,031
and you're gonna realize
that you're nothing,

926
00:56:33,033 --> 00:56:34,732
<i>and that life
has got you nowhere</i>

927
00:56:34,734 --> 00:56:37,869
because you chased
some stupid dream!

928
00:56:37,871 --> 00:56:39,371
Wake up!

929
00:56:39,373 --> 00:56:40,804
Let me finish up here.
No!

930
00:56:40,806 --> 00:56:42,873
No, I'm not leaving!
I'm not leaving!

931
00:56:42,875 --> 00:56:44,611
Yes, you are.
Let me finish up.

932
00:56:51,984 --> 00:56:54,719
What happened?
What'd they say?

933
00:56:54,721 --> 00:56:57,388
Bart? You okay?

934
00:56:57,390 --> 00:56:59,427
You're not good enough, Bart.

935
00:57:01,594 --> 00:57:03,230
You're not.

936
00:57:04,864 --> 00:57:08,866
Well, <i>that</i> didn't take
very long.

937
00:57:08,868 --> 00:57:10,802
BART: So what now?
What do we do now?

938
00:57:10,804 --> 00:57:12,570
I don't know.
Give me a second.

939
00:57:12,572 --> 00:57:14,706
There's gotta be
something we can do.

940
00:57:14,708 --> 00:57:16,574
Let me think a second.
Just gonna take that from them out there?

941
00:57:16,576 --> 00:57:18,677
You're the manager.
Do you not have an idea?

942
00:57:18,679 --> 00:57:20,512
Hold on.
What is the next step?

943
00:57:20,514 --> 00:57:23,415
Sometimes there is no
next step, Bart! Okay?

944
00:57:23,417 --> 00:57:25,416
You just ticked off
half of Nashville in there.

945
00:57:25,418 --> 00:57:28,420
What's he talking about?
You know what?

946
00:57:28,422 --> 00:57:30,788
If this is all there is...

947
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:32,023
then I'm done.

948
00:57:32,025 --> 00:57:34,491
What?
Then I quit.

949
00:57:34,493 --> 00:57:35,793
What?
Wow, really?

950
00:57:35,795 --> 00:57:37,561
Classy.
What about us?

951
00:57:37,563 --> 00:57:39,998
What about the band?
What band, Mike?

952
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,933
What about it?
They hated it.

953
00:57:42,935 --> 00:57:44,638
They hated all of it.
They hated us.

954
00:57:47,607 --> 00:57:48,942
I'm done.

955
00:57:50,444 --> 00:57:51,712
Sorry to disappoint.

956
00:57:57,851 --> 00:58:00,988
Can I come in, or you wanna sulk
a little longer?

957
00:58:07,893 --> 00:58:08,862
So...

958
00:58:11,464 --> 00:58:15,666
You just gonna quit?
Is that it?

959
00:58:15,668 --> 00:58:17,569
You got a better idea?

960
00:58:17,571 --> 00:58:21,473
I'm tired, man. I'm...

961
00:58:21,475 --> 00:58:23,406
I got nothing left.

962
00:58:23,408 --> 00:58:27,978
I'm gonna be honest with you,
like I told you I would be.

963
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:30,482
Sometimes when you're up there,

964
00:58:30,484 --> 00:58:32,784
it's like you're singing
somebody else's music.

965
00:58:32,786 --> 00:58:34,619
It's like a fake imitation.

966
00:58:34,621 --> 00:58:36,724
I don't believe it.
I don't believe <i>you.</i>

967
00:58:39,458 --> 00:58:42,627
Well, this has gone
from bad to worse, thank you.

968
00:58:42,629 --> 00:58:45,496
But then there're times...

969
00:58:45,498 --> 00:58:47,532
when I see something real.

970
00:58:47,534 --> 00:58:49,670
I see something authentic.

971
00:58:52,605 --> 00:58:56,875
But as soon as it shows up,
it's like you're afraid, and...

972
00:58:56,877 --> 00:59:00,911
and then it vanishes
just as quick as it came.

973
00:59:00,913 --> 00:59:03,547
And that's what makes you
a puzzle to me.

974
00:59:03,549 --> 00:59:06,518
Let me ask you something, Bart.

975
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:07,922
What're you running from?

976
00:59:11,525 --> 00:59:12,593
My dad.

977
00:59:17,096 --> 00:59:19,596
He, uh...

978
00:59:19,598 --> 00:59:20,931
he...

979
00:59:20,933 --> 00:59:22,866
He beat you, didn't he?

980
00:59:22,868 --> 00:59:25,203
You ain't got
no poker face, kid.

981
00:59:25,205 --> 00:59:28,572
And I carry that.
I have to live with that.

982
00:59:28,574 --> 00:59:31,543
You know?
I always will.

983
00:59:31,545 --> 00:59:32,713
Then write about it.

984
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,081
Stop running from it.

985
00:59:37,083 --> 00:59:41,219
Let that pain
become your inspiration.

986
00:59:41,221 --> 00:59:44,989
And then you'll have something
that people can believe in.

987
00:59:44,991 --> 00:59:48,496
But to do that, you got to face
your fears, son.

988
00:59:52,565 --> 00:59:53,701
You know, Bart...

989
00:59:55,768 --> 00:59:58,735
I may not always believe
in your music,

990
00:59:58,737 --> 00:59:59,871
but I do believe in you.

991
00:59:59,873 --> 01:00:02,674
You sold me, kid.

992
01:00:02,676 --> 01:00:04,612
Don't quit.

993
01:00:19,659 --> 01:00:21,494
Hey, guys, uh...

994
01:00:27,534 --> 01:00:28,502
I'm sorry.

995
01:00:32,038 --> 01:00:35,943
Um... there's some things
I need to take care of.

996
01:00:37,844 --> 01:00:39,847
Some stuff I need to sort out.

997
01:00:44,583 --> 01:00:45,752
I gotta go home.

998
01:00:54,226 --> 01:00:56,996
But I'd really, really like it
if you guys would wait for me.

999
01:00:59,632 --> 01:01:01,900
So we're still a band?

1000
01:01:01,902 --> 01:01:05,637
No, uh, we're a family.

1001
01:01:05,639 --> 01:01:07,007
Okay.

1002
01:01:13,647 --> 01:01:17,648
BART: <i>The band continued east,
and I headed back west</i>

1003
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:19,152
<i>hoping they would wait on me.</i>

1004
01:01:21,154 --> 01:01:24,087
<i>I knew I needed to deal
with things at home.</i>

1005
01:01:24,089 --> 01:01:28,192
<i>I needed to face the pain,
but the closer I got,</i>

1006
01:01:28,194 --> 01:01:32,500
<i>the only thing I felt
was... dread.</i>

(DOOR OPENS)

1011
01:02:10,804 --> 01:02:12,006
Hey, Bart.

1012
01:02:14,273 --> 01:02:15,576
Are you hungry?

1013
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:21,179
I, uh... I heard you
come in last night,

1014
01:02:21,181 --> 01:02:26,183
so, I made some bacon
and, uh, cinnamon rolls

1015
01:02:26,185 --> 01:02:30,890
and... a-a frittata, which I
just learned how to make.

1016
01:02:32,192 --> 01:02:34,192
When did you learn how to cook?

1017
01:02:34,194 --> 01:02:36,630
Oh, I been learning
a lot lately.

1018
01:02:38,632 --> 01:02:41,201
Why don't you go on in there?
I-I set the table.

1019
01:02:43,636 --> 01:02:44,904
Go on.

1020
01:02:47,741 --> 01:02:49,009
Here.

1021
01:02:56,116 --> 01:03:01,755
The key to the frittata
is how hot you make the pan.

1022
01:03:04,089 --> 01:03:05,325
That's the secret.

1023
01:03:10,897 --> 01:03:12,366
Go on and sit down.

1024
01:03:15,801 --> 01:03:17,870
Take that one.
Yeah, go ahead.

1025

01:03:29,281 --> 01:03:33,217
Well, uh... wanna say grace?

1027
01:03:33,219 --> 01:03:35,923
What?

1028
01:03:37,790 --> 01:03:38,958
I'll do it.

God, it's me here, Arthur.

1030

found God or something?

1035

to some preachers on the radio

and, uh, re... uh,
reading the Bible and whatnot.

What part?

1038
01:04:25,904 --> 01:04:28,206
All of it.

1039
01:04:28,208 --> 01:04:32,242
And, uh, couple of times,
actually.

1040
01:04:32,244 --> 01:04:35,813
And, uh, it's pretty confusing.

1041
01:04:35,815 --> 01:04:38,851
It's... like <i>Leviticus.</i>

1042

What is that?
I-I-I don't get it.

1043
01:04:45,792 --> 01:04:46,960
What prayer?

1044
01:04:48,828 --> 01:04:51,262
You said God answered a prayer.
What prayer?

I've got a few projects

1049
01:05:04,978 --> 01:05:06,777
going on around here.

1050

that you'd help me with.

Uh... I been, uh,
rebuilding that Jeep of mine.

1053
01:05:16,054 --> 01:05:18,889
And, man, when I was your age,

1054
01:05:18,891 --> 01:05:21,092
I made some memories
in that Jeep.

1055
01:05:21,094 --> 01:05:25,362
And I was hoping
that maybe we could, uh,

1056

get it running again and...

(FORK DROPS) What is this?

1059
01:05:39,011 --> 01:05:41,179
Well, I-I-I wrote you

1061
01:05:42,315 --> 01:05:45,016
Yeah. Threw 'em away.

Nope.

a memory, that's all.

for me to do, Dad.

that we have together are bad.

I'll get some ketchup.

1072
01:06:29,161 --> 01:06:30,396
I got a memory for you, Dad.

1073
01:06:32,364 --> 01:06:35,065
That night you beat me so badly

1074
01:06:35,067 --> 01:06:37,804
that I had to sleep on my
stomach 'cause I was so bruised?

Yeah, I remember that.

1078
01:06:51,618 --> 01:06:55,652
That, uh...
that tore me up.

1079
01:06:55,654 --> 01:06:59,123

about what I did to you then.

01:25:38,408 --> 01:25:40,075
It's good to be back.

1255
01:25:40,077 --> 01:25:43,480
Man, I, uh...
I haven't been on stage

1256
01:25:43,482 --> 01:25:45,147
since I lost my dad.

1257
01:25:45,149 --> 01:25:48,084
And, uh,
I'm learning to deal with it.

1258
01:25:48,086 --> 01:25:50,587
And I deal with it
the only way I know how,

1259
01:25:50,589 --> 01:25:53,222
and that's to write a song.
And I'm gonna...

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

1261

1262
01:26:00,232 --> 01:26:02,001
This is called
<i>I Can Only Imagine.</i>

1263
01:26:50,515 --> 01:26:52,548

1264

Yeah, he did.

I can't stop listening to it.

1268

I'm gonna start

(LAUGHS) Yeah, right.
Good one, guys, Real good joke.

Amy Grant.

Uh, that...
that was her, man.

That... that was Amy Grant
you hung up on.

1287

Are you serious? Give me the phone!
Yeah, that happened.

Any? Hello? Hello?
Actual Amy Grant?

1289
01:28:04,355 --> 01:28:06,489
Jim, how do I re-dial?
It's a rotary phone, Bart.

1290
01:28:06,491 --> 01:28:08,590
There's gotta be a way to redial.
Call her back.

1291
01:28:08,592 --> 01:28:11,729
How do I get in...
(PHONE RINGS)

1292
01:28:15,367 --> 01:28:17,534
Hey, Amy.

1293
01:28:17,536 --> 01:28:22,571
AMY: <i>Bart... you didn't write
this song in ten minutes.</i>

1294
01:28:22,573 --> 01:28:24,807
It took a lifetime.

1295
01:28:24,809 --> 01:28:27,610
Scott gave me a <i>Imagine</i>
when I was dealing

1296
01:28:27,612 --> 01:28:30,879
with a friend losing a battle,
you know?

1297
01:28:30,881 --> 01:28:34,851
And it got me through.
I couldn't stop listening.

1298
01:28:34,853 --> 01:28:37,386
I mean,
it's a career-maker.

1299
01:28:37,388 --> 01:28:40,522
And I know some songs
can be real personal.

1300
01:28:40,524 --> 01:28:42,694
Is this what you really want?

1301
01:28:51,402 --> 01:28:54,773
You know, I've never told
anybody my story.

1302
01:29:00,411 --> 01:29:02,481
My dad was a monster.

1303
01:29:04,683 --> 01:29:08,418
I mean,
that's the only word for it.

1304
01:29:08,420 --> 01:29:12,922
And I saw God transform him

1305
01:29:12,924 --> 01:29:17,363
from a man that I hated into
the man I wanted to become...

1306
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:20,799
into my best friend.

1307
01:29:23,734 --> 01:29:26,436
And I didn't realize it
soon enough.

1308
01:29:26,438 --> 01:29:29,308
I guess that I didn't think
that God could do that.

1309
01:29:33,444 --> 01:29:36,579
And so I wrote this song.

1310
01:29:36,581 --> 01:29:38,851
And I want as many people
as possible to hear it.

1311
01:29:40,652 --> 01:29:42,387
And you can do that.

1312
01:29:45,590 --> 01:29:46,859
I can't.

1313
01:29:49,393 --> 01:29:51,326
So...

1314
01:29:51,328 --> 01:29:54,364
yes.

1315
01:29:54,366 --> 01:29:55,900
This is what I want.

1316
01:29:58,435 --> 01:30:01,838
So, Brick. You know us.

We lay our cards on the table.

1318
01:30:03,942 --> 01:30:08,645
Amy needs a comeback song.
We believe this is it.

1319
01:30:08,647 --> 01:30:10,946
Amy is doing a homecoming date

1320
01:30:10,948 --> 01:30:13,282
here in Nashville
to kick off a fall tour.

1321
01:30:13,284 --> 01:30:16,652
We'd like to showcase it there.

anything I've written before.

(LAUGHTER)

1514
01:45:13,550 --> 01:45:15,584
<i>I Can Only Imagine,</i>
the song, was written

1515
01:45:15,586 --> 01:45:18,620
after my father passed away
with cancer many years ago.

1516
01:45:18,622 --> 01:45:21,289
Uh, he was abusive
most of my... my life.

1517
01:45:21,291 --> 01:45:23,291
If he had a bad day,
he took it out on me.

1518
01:45:23,293 --> 01:45:25,627
And he was diagnosed with cancer
when I was in high school.

1519
01:45:25,629 --> 01:45:28,629
I saw Jesus
change him completely.

1520
01:45:28,631 --> 01:45:30,531
He went from
a monster to being a man,

1521
01:45:30,533 --> 01:45:32,867
that was desperately and
passionately in love with Jesus.

1522
01:45:32,869 --> 01:45:36,271
And it kind of set me on
this warpath for the Gospel.

1523
01:45:36,273 --> 01:45:38,405
'Cause if the Gospel
can change that dude,

1524
01:45:38,407 --> 01:45:40,776
the Gospel can change anybody,
you know?
