1
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,914
Thanks.
Have a good class.

2
00:00:41,998 --> 00:00:43,883
Okay, someone has to address
the towel situation.

3
00:00:43,904 --> 00:00:45,926
Because, like,
I labeled the bins

4
00:00:45,947 --> 00:00:47,863
specifically for
certain towels.

5
00:00:47,884 --> 00:00:48,947
Hi, Renee Bennett.

6
00:00:49,874 --> 00:00:50,874
Oh.

7
00:00:50,894 --> 00:00:53,926
Uh, Renee Bennett.
Is this not where I go?

8
00:00:53,947 --> 00:00:55,832
No, this is where you go.
Just sign in here.

9
00:00:55,853 --> 00:00:57,853
-Do you need shoes?
-Yes.

10
00:00:57,874 --> 00:00:59,811
-Okay, what size?
-Eight.

11
00:00:59,832 --> 00:01:00,874
-Eight?
-Seven.

12
00:01:02,811 --> 00:01:04,926
-Seven. Okay.
-Nine and a half.

13
00:01:04,947 --> 00:01:05,967
A nine and a half?

14
00:01:05,988 --> 00:01:07,791
-Nine...
-Okay. Yeah.

15
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:08,875
Double-wide?

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Double what?

17
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:13,791
Double-wide.

18
00:01:13,812 --> 00:01:14,875
Like the trailer?

19
00:01:14,895 --> 00:01:16,948
-Um...
-Double-wide. Just...

20
00:01:17,854 --> 00:01:19,020
Do we have
a double-wide shoe?

21
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:22,000
It's just like a regular shoe,
but it's wider,

22
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,885
and then it's wider for that.

23
00:01:23,906 --> 00:01:25,843
I guess for just wider feet.

24
00:01:25,864 --> 00:01:27,020
You know what, I think
we have a male instructor

25
00:01:27,792 --> 00:01:28,876
who used to be,
like, a fireman.

26
00:01:28,896 --> 00:01:31,803
Maybe he matches
your big foot?

27
00:01:31,824 --> 00:01:32,907
I'm just going to take these.
These are perfect.

28
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,855
Okay. Have a good class.

29
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,782
So, your first time?

30
00:01:44,886 --> 00:01:45,949
Mmm-hmm.

31
00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:46,969
Me, too.

32
00:01:48,991 --> 00:01:50,908
-Really?
-Yeah.

33
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,887
We all got to
start somewhere, right?

34
00:01:55,887 --> 00:01:56,887
Yeah.

35
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,981
-All right, well, good luck.
-Yeah.

36
00:02:04,002 --> 00:02:05,908
-See you in there.
-See you.

37
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:14,930
Sorry.

38
00:02:16,961 --> 00:02:17,971
Sorry.

39
00:02:39,816 --> 00:02:40,962
Oh, shit, are you okay?

40
00:02:40,983 --> 00:02:43,795
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

41
00:02:43,816 --> 00:02:44,827
Yeah.

42
00:02:45,806 --> 00:02:47,899
No, seriously, are you okay?
'Cause that looks bad.

43
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,806
Yeah, no, I'm just going
to get some smaller shoes.

44
00:02:50,827 --> 00:02:52,953
-Are you okay?
-Um... Yeah.

45
00:03:35,944 --> 00:03:37,955
Hey, guys, this is Jen,
and today I wanted to share

46
00:03:37,975 --> 00:03:39,986
another really cool
hair tutorial with you.

47
00:03:40,007 --> 00:03:44,007
This look is a very punk rock
faux-hawk using ponytails.

48
00:03:44,027 --> 00:03:45,861
I'm going to start at the top

49
00:03:45,882 --> 00:03:47,850
and add a bump
to the top of my head.

50
00:03:47,882 --> 00:03:49,017
Back comb with some hair spray

51
00:03:49,788 --> 00:03:50,996
until you have
a lot of volume there.

52
00:03:51,017 --> 00:03:52,902
Now I'm taking
another little section

53
00:03:52,923 --> 00:03:53,975
a little bit wider.

54
00:03:54,841 --> 00:03:56,820
Now tie this part back.

55
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,914
Now at the very end
of your ponytail,

56
00:03:58,935 --> 00:04:01,789
I have this little bit
of hair at the end.

57
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,851
So I'm just going to give it
a lot of volume.

58
00:04:03,872 --> 00:04:04,987
So, this is the final look.

59
00:04:05,008 --> 00:04:07,945
I hope you guys
enjoyed this rock star,

60
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:11,841
kind of punk rock
mohawk faux-hawk.

61
00:04:11,862 --> 00:04:13,018
If you did, don't forget
to give this video

62
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:15,863
a thumbs up
and subscribe to the channel

63
00:04:15,884 --> 00:04:16,946
for more hair tutorials.

64
00:04:16,967 --> 00:04:18,998
This is Jen, and I will
talk to you guys next time.

65
00:04:25,988 --> 00:04:27,009
-Hi.
-Hi.

66
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:28,904
Are you shopping for a gift?

67
00:04:28,925 --> 00:04:31,884
No, just kind of
browsing for me.

68
00:04:32,842 --> 00:04:34,988
Okay. Um...
So sizing is a little limited

69
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:36,009
here in the store,

70
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:38,916
but you could probably
find your size online.

71
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,874
Hey, hi.

72
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,896
A guy ran by. It was weird.

73
00:05:03,854 --> 00:05:04,917
-I'm trying.
-Just, like, ask.

74
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:06,021
Just get in there.

75
00:06:57,005 --> 00:06:58,036
Mason?

76
00:06:58,901 --> 00:07:00,953
Should we have
more, like, banter?

77
00:07:03,871 --> 00:07:04,892
Nah, I'm good.

78
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:06,954
We should have fun in here.

79
00:07:06,975 --> 00:07:10,975
We should come in and be,
like, excited to interact.

80
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:15,881
I had sex last night.

81
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:16,954
Uh... Oh, cool.

82
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:19,819
I was alone.

83
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,017
Forget it.

84
00:07:22,912 --> 00:07:24,799
Did you get that email
from Corporate?

85
00:07:24,976 --> 00:07:26,945
Complaints about
the Clafoutis lipstick?

86
00:07:26,965 --> 00:07:28,018
The Clafoutis?

87
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:29,840
Customers are saying

88
00:07:29,861 --> 00:07:30,986
it's way more orange
than it looks online.

89
00:07:31,007 --> 00:07:32,882
No. Okay, then tell me

90
00:07:32,903 --> 00:07:34,809
this isn't
the exact same color.

91
00:07:34,924 --> 00:07:35,955
Look at this.

92
00:07:37,903 --> 00:07:38,965
Look.

93
00:07:38,986 --> 00:07:40,840
I just write code.

94
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:42,038
Come on, Mason.

95
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,882
This is exactly
why they should just

96
00:07:43,903 --> 00:07:44,903
let us run the website

97
00:07:44,924 --> 00:07:46,873
from the 5th Avenue
headquarters.

98
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:48,029
Right?

99
00:07:48,894 --> 00:07:49,894
God!

100
00:07:49,914 --> 00:07:51,873
Why does Lily LeClaire,
like, hide us

101
00:07:51,894 --> 00:07:53,883
in this weird
Chinatown basement?

102
00:07:53,904 --> 00:07:56,841
I'm so sick of it.
Aren't you sick of this?

103
00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:58,800
No.

104
00:07:58,821 --> 00:08:00,810
I'm getting out of here.
I'm getting a coffee.

105
00:08:00,831 --> 00:08:02,977
A real coffee. Not that crap.

106
00:08:02,998 --> 00:08:03,998
Do you want anything?

107
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:06,811
-Bagutti.
-You mean a baguette?

108
00:08:06,832 --> 00:08:08,863
-Yeah.
-You want a whole baguette?

109
00:08:08,884 --> 00:08:09,936
Half.

110
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:11,926
Half a baguette.
That's not weird.

111
00:08:15,853 --> 00:08:16,863
-Yeah?
-Yeah,

112
00:08:16,884 --> 00:08:17,905
the highlighter does it.

113
00:08:19,842 --> 00:08:21,832
Viv, you look gorgeous.

114
00:08:21,853 --> 00:08:23,822
-Right?
-You look really beautiful.

115
00:08:23,842 --> 00:08:24,842
Ooh.

116
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:27,009
Wow. I mean, I do look pretty.

117
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,854
Just... I don't know
if I look like me.

118
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:30,948
No, you don't
look like yourself.

119
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,979
But you do look
like Selena Gomez

120
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,802
in that video
where she says, "It ain't me."

121
00:08:35,823 --> 00:08:37,906
It is you.
Like, I recreated it.

122
00:08:37,927 --> 00:08:41,885
Are you sure I don't look like
sort of a lady of the night?

123
00:08:41,906 --> 00:08:42,916
Like a prostitute?

124
00:08:42,937 --> 00:08:44,021
Come over here, boys.

125
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:46,041
No, and they don't talk
like that anymore.

126
00:08:46,812 --> 00:08:47,916
Like, it's kind of rad
that your work

127
00:08:47,937 --> 00:08:48,949
lets you take all this stuff.

128
00:08:48,969 --> 00:08:49,969
I know.

129
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,824
Well, it's more
like implied...

130
00:08:51,844 --> 00:08:53,042
You know, they're not like,
"Here's a gift bag."

131
00:08:53,813 --> 00:08:55,865
But I steal it.

132
00:08:55,886 --> 00:08:56,959
No, but
a lot of it's recalled.

133
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,980
They wouldn't care.

134
00:08:58,001 --> 00:08:59,897
Like, this one they said
looks like contraception.

135
00:08:59,917 --> 00:09:01,813
Oh, hey, it really does.

136
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:02,990
That's exactly
what my pill pack looks like.

137
00:09:03,011 --> 00:09:04,990
Yeah, but a lot of people
like having sex

138
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,803
and not having a baby,

139
00:09:06,824 --> 00:09:08,001
so I don't know
what the problem is.

140
00:09:08,022 --> 00:09:09,814
I met this baby the other day

141
00:09:09,835 --> 00:09:11,991
that was, like, wack as hell.
Honestly.

142
00:09:12,012 --> 00:09:13,918
-Really?
-Okay.

143
00:09:13,939 --> 00:09:15,825
This is the Groupie sight?

144
00:09:15,845 --> 00:09:17,835
It's not "Groupie."
It's Grouper Date.

145
00:09:17,856 --> 00:09:19,002
And you're not bailing
because we need three people

146
00:09:19,023 --> 00:09:20,825
in order to get matched
on a date.

147
00:09:20,845 --> 00:09:21,939
-Yes.
-Yeah, but look at them.

148
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,960
Come look at these pictures.

149
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:24,845
These are the people
we're competing with?

150
00:09:25,887 --> 00:09:27,908
Three Eurasian
cocktail waitresses.

151
00:09:27,929 --> 00:09:28,929
Yeah?

152
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,836
Three
Australian wakeboarders.

153
00:09:31,888 --> 00:09:32,961
And the Hadids!

154
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,951
Is that the mom?

155
00:09:34,982 --> 00:09:36,003
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

156
00:09:36,024 --> 00:09:38,044
I'm not competing with this.
I'm not doing it.

157
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:41,909
Well, Renee, the thing is,
like, different kinds of men

158
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,034
are looking
for different things.

159
00:09:43,805 --> 00:09:44,951
Like, I mean, I know

160
00:09:44,971 --> 00:09:46,899
that my guy is going to
be interested

161
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,940
in the fact
that I like true crime

162
00:09:49,961 --> 00:09:51,034
and inter-species
animal friendships.

163
00:09:51,806 --> 00:09:52,889
Please...

164
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,858
And I've added them all
on dares...

165
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:55,931
No, don't put that
on the profile.

166
00:09:55,952 --> 00:09:57,972
My God, Viv, nobody cares
about the profile.

167
00:09:57,993 --> 00:09:59,879
No one even
looks at the profile.

168
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,004
The picture
is all that matters,

169
00:10:01,025 --> 00:10:02,920
and you get
a picture of yourself

170
00:10:02,941 --> 00:10:04,889
and you feel, like,
really good about it

171
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,858
and you hide your double chin,
you hide your acne,

172
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:09,025
and you hide your cellulite.

173
00:10:09,045 --> 00:10:10,910
And then when the guy
meets you in person,

174
00:10:10,931 --> 00:10:12,838
he's, like, so disappointed.

175
00:10:12,859 --> 00:10:13,984
Or you take
a picture of yourself

176
00:10:14,005 --> 00:10:16,015
where you feel like
it really looks like you.

177
00:10:16,036 --> 00:10:17,994
And then
you check your profile

178
00:10:18,015 --> 00:10:21,890
and no one is liking it
or clicking it or twitting it

179
00:10:21,911 --> 00:10:22,994
or poking you.

180
00:10:23,015 --> 00:10:24,015
And you didn't even want

181
00:10:24,036 --> 00:10:25,911
to go out with this guy
in the first place.

182
00:10:25,932 --> 00:10:28,921
But he's rejecting you,
and it's not fair,

183
00:10:28,942 --> 00:10:29,984
and I'm sick of it.

184
00:10:32,005 --> 00:10:33,015
Well...

185
00:10:34,974 --> 00:10:38,829
You raise a lot
of interesting points, Renee.

186
00:10:38,849 --> 00:10:40,860
And thank you
for that pep talk.

187
00:10:40,881 --> 00:10:41,881
Yes, thank you.

188
00:10:41,902 --> 00:10:44,808
I feel like this is
exactly what we needed.

189
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:45,860
You guys are jerks.

190
00:10:45,881 --> 00:10:47,849
Let's just take a fun picture.

191
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,016
-Yeah.
-Let's just do it.

192
00:10:49,037 --> 00:10:51,027
-I'm a photo queen!
-Look at this face!

193
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,849
-Whoo!
-Okay.

194
00:10:55,038 --> 00:10:56,038
That's not good.

195
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,903
We look like
we're being attacked, Viv.

196
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:00,975
- That's bad.
- I look mid-poop.

197
00:11:01,017 --> 00:11:03,903
It looks like you're, like,
having sex with me.

198
00:11:05,882 --> 00:11:06,903
Viv!

199
00:11:08,882 --> 00:11:09,882
Okay...

200
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:11,007
Come on... And three.

201
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:12,944
And that's the one.

202
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:19,862
What the hell, Mason?

203
00:11:21,008 --> 00:11:22,956
I spilled salad dressing
on myself.

204
00:11:22,976 --> 00:11:24,028
God, look, I know this office

205
00:11:24,049 --> 00:11:25,893
isn't the epicenter
of anything,

206
00:11:25,914 --> 00:11:27,049
but once we stop
feeling compelled

207
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,810
to participate
in things like pants,

208
00:11:29,831 --> 00:11:31,841
we've gone too far outside
the social contract.

209
00:11:31,862 --> 00:11:33,820
We're in a crisis, Renee.
The server's down.

210
00:11:33,841 --> 00:11:34,841
It's happened before,
it always

211
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:35,914
comes back online,
but not this time.

212
00:11:35,935 --> 00:11:37,915
No... Wait, wait.

213
00:11:37,936 --> 00:11:39,050
How are we going to get
the web traffic reports

214
00:11:39,821 --> 00:11:40,863
to Corporate
for their 11:00 a.m.?

215
00:11:40,884 --> 00:11:42,019
It's our only job
in this stupid office!

216
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,832
I'm already
printing out the reports,

217
00:11:43,852 --> 00:11:44,863
and it's not stupid.

218
00:11:45,811 --> 00:11:46,852
Maybe a little.

219
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:47,977
Either way, you can
leave our stupid office

220
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,029
in about 10 seconds.

221
00:11:49,884 --> 00:11:50,915
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

222
00:11:50,936 --> 00:11:52,998
You think I'm going
to Lily LeClaire today?

223
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:55,925
Oh, no, I am not
going to Lily LeClaire.

224
00:11:55,946 --> 00:11:56,989
I promise you that, okay.

225
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,895
-I did not shower.
-You never shower.

226
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,905
I never shower for work.

227
00:12:00,926 --> 00:12:02,822
Okay, I shower at night.

228
00:12:02,843 --> 00:12:04,937
When I shower is my business.
I'm not going there.

229
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,999
No, I'm wearing
bathing suit bottoms

230
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,833
'cause I have no clean undies.

231
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:09,968
I have
a Bed Bath and Beyond bag

232
00:12:09,989 --> 00:12:11,010
for my purse. No!

233
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,812
Repeat after me.

234
00:12:13,905 --> 00:12:14,968
I am brave.

235
00:12:14,989 --> 00:12:16,926
-I am brave.
-I am blonde.

236
00:12:16,947 --> 00:12:18,896
-I am blonde.
-And I got this.

237
00:12:18,917 --> 00:12:19,948
And I got this.

238
00:12:19,969 --> 00:12:21,865
-I am brave!
-I am brave!

239
00:12:21,886 --> 00:12:22,979
-I am blonde!
-I am blonde!

240
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,823
-And I got this!
-And I got this!

241
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:25,854
I am brave!

242
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:23,972
For Steve in Marketing.

243
00:13:23,993 --> 00:13:26,055
Okay, great. I'll make sure
she gets them.

244
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:33,993
Is that Avery LeClaire?

245
00:13:35,024 --> 00:13:37,014
-Yeah.
-There she is again. Oh!

246
00:13:42,983 --> 00:13:45,879
Oh, my God.
She's right there.

247
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,973
Is that so cool?

248
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,025
What's that?

249
00:13:48,046 --> 00:13:50,931
You know,
being the receptionist here?

250
00:13:50,952 --> 00:13:52,025
Just being around it all?

251
00:13:52,046 --> 00:13:54,890
No, I'm just
an intern filling in.

252
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,973
They're trying to find
a new receptionist, actually.

253
00:13:57,858 --> 00:13:58,858
Shut up.

254
00:13:59,015 --> 00:14:00,931
Oh, come on.
It's like a dream job.

255
00:14:01,015 --> 00:14:03,911
Um, I'll make sure
Marketing gets these papers.

256
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:04,943
Okay.

257
00:14:04,964 --> 00:14:06,057
I'm gonna head out.

258
00:14:06,828 --> 00:14:07,995
Can we all say hello
to my grandmother, Lily,

259
00:14:08,016 --> 00:14:09,047
who will be joining us today?

260
00:14:09,818 --> 00:14:10,849
Hello, Lily.

261
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,932
We are in our third quarter
of our fiscal year,

262
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:14,974
and as you are all aware
the research results

263
00:14:14,995 --> 00:14:17,953
have come in
on our diffusion line.

264
00:14:17,974 --> 00:14:20,901
Do you have to say
"diffusion" like that?

265
00:14:21,057 --> 00:14:23,954
-Like what?
-Like it means "low end"?

266
00:14:23,975 --> 00:14:25,017
It does mean "low end."

267
00:14:25,954 --> 00:14:27,892
It also means "accessible."

268
00:14:28,892 --> 00:14:30,850
Or "thoughtfully priced."

269
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:31,881
Say it like that.

270
00:14:33,048 --> 00:14:34,850
Okay.

271
00:14:36,006 --> 00:14:37,985
It seems that
we have some work to do

272
00:14:38,006 --> 00:14:40,871
on our diffusion line

273
00:14:40,892 --> 00:14:44,048
because we are new
to the diffusion landscape.

274
00:14:44,819 --> 00:14:45,934
We need to get people
used to seeing

275
00:14:45,955 --> 00:14:47,955
our products not just
at Saks and Bendel's,

276
00:14:47,976 --> 00:14:50,841
but also at Target and Kohl's.

277
00:14:51,841 --> 00:14:52,882
Jenn, go.

278
00:14:53,028 --> 00:14:55,861
Well, it says here that 74%

279
00:14:55,882 --> 00:14:57,028
of core diffusion
demo respondents

280
00:14:57,049 --> 00:14:59,049
strongly believe that we are

281
00:15:00,018 --> 00:15:01,059
elitist pricks.

282
00:15:02,059 --> 00:15:04,924
Okay, so what I am hearing
is that

283
00:15:05,914 --> 00:15:07,914
we need to pivot in order...

284
00:15:08,852 --> 00:15:10,883
This is
not rocket science, Avery.

285
00:15:10,904 --> 00:15:13,821
We're just trying to start

286
00:15:13,842 --> 00:15:17,050
a line of accessible cosmetics
at Target.

287
00:15:17,821 --> 00:15:19,977
Who here has gone
makeup shopping at Target?

288
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:21,821
-You?
-No!

289
00:15:21,842 --> 00:15:22,873
-Either of you?
-Mmm.

290
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:23,987
No.

291
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:27,853
Unbelievable.

292
00:15:28,843 --> 00:15:30,915
People think
that we are elitists

293
00:15:30,936 --> 00:15:33,843
who do not belong at Target,

294
00:15:33,863 --> 00:15:34,968
and they may be right.

295
00:15:35,051 --> 00:15:37,832
But when people
walk into this office,

296
00:15:37,926 --> 00:15:40,999
I want them to see
that Lily LeClaire

297
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,947
includes everyone.

298
00:15:43,853 --> 00:15:45,843
Even bargain shoppers.

299
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,969
"Must be passionate
about beauty..."

300
00:15:54,989 --> 00:15:56,010
Me.

301
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,958
"...and dream
of sitting in our lobby..."

302
00:15:59,969 --> 00:16:01,000
Me.

303
00:16:01,062 --> 00:16:03,021
"...at the center of it all.

304
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:08,031
"Must be stylish
and full of confidence."

305
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:11,917
I mean...

306
00:16:12,824 --> 00:16:14,897
Maybe not full of confidence.

307
00:16:15,949 --> 00:16:18,928
"The first face people see
when they come to our office,

308
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:21,959
"in some ways, the real face
of our beauty line."

309
00:16:23,938 --> 00:16:25,042
Whatever.

310
00:16:31,002 --> 00:16:32,929
Yes, it is the perfect job,

311
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,908
of course I know that.
I'm just...

312
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:36,898
I don't even see
a point in applying.

313
00:16:36,918 --> 00:16:37,960
I have no shot.

314
00:16:38,929 --> 00:16:39,950
Yeah.

315
00:16:40,064 --> 00:16:42,866
I'm not exactly
the face they're looking for.

316
00:16:44,866 --> 00:16:46,856
Oh. Hey, Jane,
can I call you back?

317
00:16:54,826 --> 00:16:55,836
Hi.

318
00:16:55,951 --> 00:16:57,940
Um, Renee. We kind of met
at SoulCycle...

319
00:16:57,961 --> 00:16:59,992
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah, yeah.

320
00:17:00,013 --> 00:17:01,044
How's your vagina?

321
00:17:02,065 --> 00:17:03,919
-Oh.
-Like, the whole region?

322
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,961
Thanks for asking.

323
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,930
The region is kind of
as good as can be expected.

324
00:17:07,951 --> 00:17:08,951
Was there blood?

325
00:17:08,971 --> 00:17:10,065
There was not not-blood.

326
00:17:10,836 --> 00:17:11,858
Hey, hi.

327
00:17:12,004 --> 00:17:13,004
Wow.

328
00:17:13,025 --> 00:17:14,045
-Hi.
-I'm sorry,

329
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:15,066
I'm so lost.

330
00:17:15,837 --> 00:17:18,858
Could you tell me where to
find that squeezy dish soap?

331
00:17:18,879 --> 00:17:19,900
-Uh...
-Now, you're probably

332
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,004
wondering why I'm not
asking, you know,

333
00:17:21,025 --> 00:17:22,931
the person
that obviously works here.

334
00:17:22,952 --> 00:17:23,972
But...

335
00:17:23,993 --> 00:17:25,014
I don't work here.

336
00:17:25,035 --> 00:17:27,972
But I've gotten
really good at dishes.

337
00:17:27,993 --> 00:17:29,889
And so, I was just wondering

338
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,035
if you might
have some dishes...

339
00:17:31,056 --> 00:17:32,921
Oh, my gosh,
I'm so sorry, I forgot.

340
00:17:32,942 --> 00:17:33,942
It's in aisle 10.

341
00:17:33,963 --> 00:17:36,057
-Hey, we're good, sir.
-Oh.

342
00:17:36,828 --> 00:17:38,973
I was thinking, you can
give me your number...

343
00:17:38,994 --> 00:17:41,859
Um, I'm so sorry,
I don't give out my number.

344
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,828
It's nice to meet you.

345
00:17:43,953 --> 00:17:45,036
-So...
-It's nice to meet you.

346
00:17:45,057 --> 00:17:46,859
Good luck with the dishes
and everything else.

347
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,890
Thank you.

348
00:17:50,015 --> 00:17:52,838
Does that kind of stuff
happen all the time?

349
00:17:52,942 --> 00:17:53,985
What, him?

350
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:56,995
Yeah, like a guy, like,
trying to hook up

351
00:17:57,016 --> 00:17:59,027
with you in
a totally normal place?

352
00:17:59,047 --> 00:18:01,922
Yeah, I'm sure that happens
to you all the time, too.

353
00:18:01,954 --> 00:18:02,964
Uh, no.

354
00:18:02,985 --> 00:18:04,912
That has literally never
happened to me in my life.

355
00:18:04,933 --> 00:18:06,006
Yeah, well,
I don't believe you.

356
00:18:06,027 --> 00:18:07,027
Wait, can I ask you
a question?

357
00:18:07,047 --> 00:18:08,047
Yeah.

358
00:18:08,068 --> 00:18:10,068
Did you ever go on a trip
to, like, Italy or something,

359
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,902
and you land at the airport
and then, like,

360
00:18:13,922 --> 00:18:15,059
you meet these two guys,

361
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,861
and they're like, "Hey, come
on this yacht with us,"

362
00:18:17,882 --> 00:18:20,965
and then you wind up going on
a yacht trip in, like, Capri.

363
00:18:20,986 --> 00:18:22,830
And it's like
this whole other part

364
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:23,965
of your trip
you didn't even foresee.

365
00:18:24,923 --> 00:18:25,975
- But, like...
- Yeah.

366
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,934
I had one like that
last summer.

367
00:18:27,955 --> 00:18:28,986
In Greece, though, not Italy.

368
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:30,017
I knew it.

369
00:18:30,038 --> 00:18:31,975
-I knew it! I knew it!
-Yeah.

370
00:18:31,996 --> 00:18:34,017
God, I knew
that stuff happened.

371
00:18:34,038 --> 00:18:36,018
Oh, man, I've just...

372
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:38,841
I've always wondered
what it feels like to be just

373
00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:41,904
undeniably pretty.

374
00:18:43,966 --> 00:18:47,039
And just have all those parts
in life open up to you

375
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,997
that you only
get to experience

376
00:18:49,018 --> 00:18:50,883
when you look like you.

377
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,070
Just once...

378
00:18:56,988 --> 00:18:58,061
I mean...

379
00:18:58,832 --> 00:18:59,946
I don't think that
this mascara

380
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,852
or Wet n Wild bronzer

381
00:19:01,873 --> 00:19:03,905
can do that kind
of heavy lifting. So...

382
00:19:06,009 --> 00:19:07,905
I'll just pray for a miracle.

383
00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:09,967
Hey. It's not in 10.

384
00:19:10,925 --> 00:19:13,915
Nine. It was aisle nine.
Do you want me to show you?

385
00:19:13,936 --> 00:19:15,998
Can we get you back
to register two?

386
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:17,978
I don't work here.

387
00:19:26,593 --> 00:19:29,500
<i> Make my wish right.</i>

388
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,552
I wish I were big.

389
00:19:54,646 --> 00:19:56,563
This is crazy! This is crazy!

390
00:19:57,678 --> 00:19:58,688
I wish...

391
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:01,543
I wish I was beautiful!

392
00:20:17,699 --> 00:20:18,699
Please.

393
00:20:19,606 --> 00:20:21,596
Please, please,
please. Please.

394
00:20:51,566 --> 00:20:53,566
What's up, SoHo, I'm Luna!

395
00:20:57,597 --> 00:20:58,701
Are you ready?

396
00:21:01,462 --> 00:21:02,514
All right, y'all, I don't know

397
00:21:02,535 --> 00:21:03,640
what you came
in here for today,

398
00:21:03,661 --> 00:21:06,692
but what I do know is that
the miracle is already here.

399
00:21:07,671 --> 00:21:10,505
You just have to open
your heart and receive it.

400
00:21:10,525 --> 00:21:11,650
I want you
to look in the mirror

401
00:21:11,671 --> 00:21:14,525
and visualize the change
you came in here for.

402
00:21:14,546 --> 00:21:16,650
Is it spiritual?
Is it physical?

403
00:21:17,494 --> 00:21:18,525
Is it emotional?

404
00:21:18,692 --> 00:21:21,661
Today I want you
to look in the mirror.

405
00:21:21,682 --> 00:21:24,495
You're not going to see
what you normally see.

406
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:25,641
Today you're going to see

407
00:21:25,662 --> 00:21:29,506
what you've
always wanted to be.

408
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:31,578
So, you ready
to get your life?

409
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:35,547
SoHo, are you ready
to get your life?

410
00:21:35,568 --> 00:21:36,620
<i>- Change your life!</i>

411
00:21:36,641 --> 00:21:39,526
Change your body!
Change your life!

412
00:21:39,547 --> 00:21:40,662
Yeah!

413
00:21:42,485 --> 00:21:43,610
<i>- Three, two, one!</i>

414
00:21:48,632 --> 00:21:49,684
Oh, my God, are you okay?

415
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,632
We got a white girl down.

416
00:22:03,632 --> 00:22:04,632
Hey.

417
00:22:08,653 --> 00:22:11,476
You hit your head really hard
on the way down.

418
00:22:12,528 --> 00:22:14,612
Sorry. Oh, God.

419
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:17,685
Here's an ice pack.

420
00:22:18,466 --> 00:22:21,466
Oh, God, thank you.

421
00:22:21,612 --> 00:22:22,643
And some water.

422
00:22:24,674 --> 00:22:27,509
And we have
a complimentary bandana.

423
00:22:29,509 --> 00:22:31,665
You didn't have to do that.
This is too much.

424
00:22:34,529 --> 00:22:36,509
This is huge.

425
00:22:46,467 --> 00:22:47,529
Did something
happen to your arm?

426
00:22:49,687 --> 00:22:51,697
Should I call a doctor?

427
00:22:53,645 --> 00:22:56,562
Yeah...

428
00:23:07,489 --> 00:23:08,530
Are your legs okay?

429
00:23:08,572 --> 00:23:11,677
No! They're not okay.

430
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:18,490
They're amazing. Oh, my God.

431
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:20,552
Do I look super toned to you?

432
00:23:20,636 --> 00:23:21,646
Uh...

433
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:23,656
I don't know
how to answer that.

434
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:26,656
-Oh, my God, feel my abs!
-Uh...

435
00:23:26,677 --> 00:23:27,688
Rock hard, right?

436
00:23:28,469 --> 00:23:29,469
Feels full.

437
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:30,605
-It's a rock.
-Uh-huh.

438
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:32,543
Wait...

439
00:23:43,668 --> 00:23:44,678
Wait.

440
00:23:45,699 --> 00:23:47,657
Wait, no.

441
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,470
Wait.

442
00:23:50,658 --> 00:23:51,658
Wait.

443
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:56,565
-That's me?
-Yeah.

444
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,710
No.

445
00:24:04,502 --> 00:24:08,471
What? Oh, my God,
do you see this?

446
00:24:08,523 --> 00:24:09,523
Yes?

447
00:24:09,544 --> 00:24:13,607
I mean... Look at me!
Look at my jawline!

448
00:24:14,503 --> 00:24:16,566
No, no, I always
wanted this to happen.

449
00:24:16,586 --> 00:24:17,701
You dream this will happen,

450
00:24:18,472 --> 00:24:19,524
but I never thought
it would really happen!

451
00:24:19,545 --> 00:24:20,659
I mean, look at me!

452
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,701
Look at my boobs!
Look at my ass!

453
00:24:27,701 --> 00:24:29,524
I'm beautiful!

454
00:24:32,567 --> 00:24:34,681
All right, if you're good,

455
00:24:35,692 --> 00:24:38,515
I'm going to take this back
and go to the front.

456
00:24:38,535 --> 00:24:39,681
As long as you don't sue.

457
00:25:11,672 --> 00:25:13,526
Hey, great dress.

458
00:25:13,547 --> 00:25:14,569
Thanks. It's from Target.

459
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,600
Of course it is.

460
00:25:16,621 --> 00:25:18,517
Aren't girls like us so lucky,

461
00:25:18,537 --> 00:25:19,673
that we can shop like anywhere

462
00:25:19,694 --> 00:25:21,683
and still look fly as hell.

463
00:25:21,714 --> 00:25:23,642
-I guess.
-Yeah!

464
00:25:26,704 --> 00:25:29,714
Oh, gosh! Thank you.

465
00:25:30,485 --> 00:25:31,662
Chivalry, alive and well.

466
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,486
Jimmy, come here!

467
00:25:51,497 --> 00:25:52,601
For Lisa in HR.

468
00:25:52,622 --> 00:25:54,580
My name's Renee Bennett,

469
00:25:54,601 --> 00:25:56,581
and I'm applying
for the receptionist job.

470
00:26:10,685 --> 00:26:12,487
Don't scream.

471
00:26:12,591 --> 00:26:14,539
Slowly turn around.

472
00:26:15,654 --> 00:26:18,572
Okay, I know you don't
recognize me.

473
00:26:18,592 --> 00:26:19,624
-I know that.
-Mmm.

474
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:22,697
But I'm going to prove to you
that I am your friend.

475
00:26:22,717 --> 00:26:24,665
-Your good friend...
-Hey, sluts.

476
00:26:24,686 --> 00:26:27,655
Oh, my God. Okay.
Don't scream.

477
00:26:27,676 --> 00:26:30,551
No, no one is screaming.

478
00:26:30,634 --> 00:26:32,551
Don't even make
the noise you just made.

479
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:36,634
Okay. Okay, now I know
you don't recognize me.

480
00:26:37,509 --> 00:26:38,604
You're thinking,
"Who is this girl?

481
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:39,656
"And why is she here?

482
00:26:39,677 --> 00:26:43,489
"What was she doing covering
our screaming-ass mouths?"

483
00:26:43,573 --> 00:26:45,552
You guys, it's me.

484
00:26:45,718 --> 00:26:47,604
Renee.

485
00:26:51,677 --> 00:26:52,677
What's happening?

486
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:54,614
Full spin.

487
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,594
Oh, my God,
you don't believe me.

488
00:26:59,615 --> 00:27:00,615
Why would you?

489
00:27:00,636 --> 00:27:02,678
Okay, I'm going to prove
to you that I'm Renee.

490
00:27:02,699 --> 00:27:04,594
All right, I'm just going
to tell you something

491
00:27:04,615 --> 00:27:05,646
that there's no way
I would know

492
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:06,667
unless I was Renee.

493
00:27:06,688 --> 00:27:08,532
Okay. Um...

494
00:27:08,615 --> 00:27:09,709
Oh, remember the summer

495
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,605
we all were gonna
get those tattoos

496
00:27:11,626 --> 00:27:14,521
of the  characters<i>90210</i>
on our ankles. Right?

497
00:27:14,542 --> 00:27:16,532
But we decided not to
because we were like,

498
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:17,605
"What if we don't always feel

499
00:27:17,626 --> 00:27:18,699
"this strongly
about the actors?"

500
00:27:18,719 --> 00:27:20,689
-Thank God.
-How would anyone know that?

501
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:23,575
Everyone would
know that, right?

502
00:27:23,595 --> 00:27:26,522
Because I actually
got Andrea Zuckerman

503
00:27:26,543 --> 00:27:29,606
tattooed on my ankle before
you guys bailed on the idea.

504
00:27:29,627 --> 00:27:31,481
I forgot that, I'm sorry.

505
00:27:31,502 --> 00:27:32,689
-I still feel so bad.
-No.

506
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:34,637
What's something only
I would know? Help me.

507
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:37,522
You have HPV.

508
00:27:37,585 --> 00:27:39,595
-Everybody has HPV.
-I have it, too.

509
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:42,680
The point is, it's me! Renee!

510
00:27:43,576 --> 00:27:44,659
And I don't know
how this happened

511
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,701
and I can't explain it.

512
00:27:45,721 --> 00:27:47,523
All I know is that Luna

513
00:27:47,544 --> 00:27:49,680
reached into
my Soul Cycled soul

514
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:52,607
and just gave me
what I've always wanted.

515
00:27:52,628 --> 00:27:54,555
The chance to be beautiful!

516
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:56,628
Oh.

517
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:59,544
-Yeah, well, that's great.
-Yeah.

518
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:02,535
-I'm so happy for you...
-Are you?

519
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:04,670
...that you are
working out and that

520
00:28:04,691 --> 00:28:07,618
that clearly is making,
like, a big change for you.

521
00:28:07,639 --> 00:28:09,545
I mean, like,
I hear really good things

522
00:28:09,566 --> 00:28:12,545
about Soul Cycle and,
like, you look great.

523
00:28:12,577 --> 00:28:16,545
Great? Guys, I'm a Kardashian.
One of the Jenner ones.

524
00:28:16,566 --> 00:28:19,577
Maybe now that
your contacts are in...

525
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:21,629
I don't wear contacts.
I don't wear glasses.

526
00:28:21,649 --> 00:28:23,536
I was just taking a swing,

527
00:28:23,557 --> 00:28:25,505
-and it was a miss.
-Yeah.

528
00:28:25,525 --> 00:28:28,494
You're trying to make sense
of this, and you can't.

529
00:28:28,515 --> 00:28:30,619
That's true.
We cannot make sense of this.

530
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,723
But I want you guys to know

531
00:28:32,494 --> 00:28:33,619
that even through I look like
this very different,

532
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,692
very hot person,

533
00:28:36,598 --> 00:28:37,692
it's still me in here.

534
00:28:38,567 --> 00:28:39,567
It's Renee.

535
00:28:40,505 --> 00:28:41,682
I'm not going anywhere.

536
00:28:41,703 --> 00:28:43,650
- Okay.
- Okay?

537
00:28:43,671 --> 00:28:44,693
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

538
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:46,610
But I am going to go to
the bar and get us drinks.

539
00:28:46,631 --> 00:28:47,651
I could use one.

540
00:28:47,672 --> 00:28:49,579
-Tequila?
-Sure.

541
00:28:49,693 --> 00:28:52,724
How would I know that,
unless I was Renee?

542
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:54,631
Okay.

543
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:06,600
Hey, Mason. I'm sorry
I can't make it again.

544
00:29:07,652 --> 00:29:09,621
I'll have to work remotely,
I have pink eye.

545
00:29:10,527 --> 00:29:11,632
Yeah, it's really bad.

546
00:29:12,621 --> 00:29:14,611
It's like, it looks like
my eyes are bleeding.

547
00:29:15,517 --> 00:29:16,600
Um...

548
00:29:17,496 --> 00:29:19,652
Yeah, no, I know
it doesn't affect your voice,

549
00:29:19,673 --> 00:29:21,600
but it's like
the really bad kind

550
00:29:21,621 --> 00:29:23,715
that causes flare-ups
in prison populations.

551
00:29:24,486 --> 00:29:25,580
Look, I gotta go,
I'm going to the doctor.

552
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,643
Hopefully,
I'll be in tomorrow,

553
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:30,508
but I'm going
in the subway, so I'm...

554
00:29:30,664 --> 00:29:32,487
Hello? Hello?

555
00:29:32,508 --> 00:29:33,560
116.

556
00:29:35,695 --> 00:29:36,716
Uh...

557
00:29:38,497 --> 00:29:39,726
You probably haven't
been here before,

558
00:29:40,497 --> 00:29:41,664
but you have to wait in line
and take a number.

559
00:29:42,487 --> 00:29:43,633
-Oh, right.
-I can grab it for you.

560
00:29:43,653 --> 00:29:44,653
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

561
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:46,716
-I just... Here.
-Thank you.

562
00:29:47,488 --> 00:29:48,665
And this guy just
calls out a number

563
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:49,686
completely out of sequence.

564
00:29:49,707 --> 00:29:50,707
Okay.

565
00:29:50,727 --> 00:29:52,519
It's like a weird game
of bingo.

566
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,623
-All right.
-But no one wins. So, yeah.

567
00:29:57,519 --> 00:29:58,540
What's your number?

568
00:30:03,582 --> 00:30:04,717
So this is how it happens?

569
00:30:05,717 --> 00:30:08,572
Just like that? Wow.

570
00:30:08,655 --> 00:30:11,562
Just like what?
What happens, like what?

571
00:30:11,583 --> 00:30:12,655
That is very clever.

572
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:15,541
I don't know why that's...
What is clever?

573
00:30:15,562 --> 00:30:16,572
I'm just asking
what the number is.

574
00:30:16,593 --> 00:30:19,510
What's your number?
And then I go, "Oh, 118..."

575
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:21,551
And then you're like,
"No, your phone number."

576
00:30:21,728 --> 00:30:23,635
-Oh.
-Yeah. You are good.

577
00:30:23,708 --> 00:30:25,635
How long have you been hanging
onto that little nugget?

578
00:30:25,655 --> 00:30:27,551
I haven't. I haven't been
holding onto that.

579
00:30:27,572 --> 00:30:28,572
That's not a nugget.

580
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:29,625
You hang out in
a lot of dry cleaners

581
00:30:29,646 --> 00:30:31,584
and hit on perfect girls?

582
00:30:33,677 --> 00:30:34,719
All right, give me your phone.

583
00:30:35,563 --> 00:30:36,573
My phone?

584
00:30:36,594 --> 00:30:37,625
Give me your phone, I'm going
to give you my number.

585
00:30:37,646 --> 00:30:39,656
-Are you still talking to me?
-Don't chicken out now, son.

586
00:30:39,677 --> 00:30:41,490
-I'm not chickening out.
-Here, come on.

587
00:30:41,511 --> 00:30:42,709
Give me, we'll exchange
phones. That's what'll happen.

588
00:30:42,729 --> 00:30:44,698
Here, give me your phone,
you take my phone,

589
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:46,709
put your number in.
Level the playing field.

590
00:30:46,729 --> 00:30:47,729
Do people do this?

591
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,604
And this way you don't have
to feel intimidated.

592
00:30:49,729 --> 00:30:51,532
I know what it's like.

593
00:30:51,553 --> 00:30:54,699
Okay. Yeah. That's me.

594
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,720
Okay.

595
00:30:56,491 --> 00:30:58,543
And you know,
I'm slammed right now.

596
00:30:58,616 --> 00:31:00,564
But I will do my best
to pencil you in.

597
00:31:00,585 --> 00:31:02,626
Right after the jailhouse
pink eye clears up?

598
00:31:04,605 --> 00:31:05,605
Who are you?

599
00:31:05,637 --> 00:31:07,512
Number 118!

600
00:31:09,543 --> 00:31:10,584
That's me.

601
00:31:13,669 --> 00:31:14,669
Hi.

602
00:31:16,513 --> 00:31:19,596
Oh, I couldn't get
the red vomit stain out of it.

603
00:31:19,617 --> 00:31:21,544
What was it, like sangria?

604
00:31:21,617 --> 00:31:23,648
Some wine, like a red?
Something like that?

605
00:31:23,669 --> 00:31:25,627
It had chunks in it,
did you know that?

606
00:31:25,648 --> 00:31:27,596
And then you let it
sit for a while,

607
00:31:27,617 --> 00:31:28,617
and I couldn't really...

608
00:31:28,648 --> 00:31:29,648
That's fine.

609
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,533
I could take
another whack at it,

610
00:31:31,554 --> 00:31:32,555
if you want.

611
00:31:32,586 --> 00:31:34,670
I'm not a magician. 119!

612
00:31:36,639 --> 00:31:39,597
So, look, I have not
logged into our account

613
00:31:39,618 --> 00:31:40,691
since our profile went live

614
00:31:40,711 --> 00:31:42,503
'cause I thought we could
all do it together.

615
00:31:42,524 --> 00:31:44,493
Yeah, I think
that's the best idea.

616
00:31:44,514 --> 00:31:45,722
Um, excuse me, bartender.

617
00:31:46,493 --> 00:31:48,576
Can I please get
a couple shots of tequila?

618
00:31:48,607 --> 00:31:49,659
-Uh...
-Can you stop it?

619
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,680
It's a coffee shop.

620
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:53,567
Now, listen. This is going to
be awesome. Trust me.

621
00:31:53,587 --> 00:31:55,608
I'm about to make it
rain responses.

622
00:32:02,608 --> 00:32:03,608
Hit refresh.

623
00:32:03,629 --> 00:32:05,567
-Yeah, refresh.
-Always refresh.

624
00:32:09,671 --> 00:32:11,702
-Are we on the Wi-Fi or...
-Yeah, we are.

625
00:32:11,723 --> 00:32:15,693
So, it's true. Guys really
only care about photos.

626
00:32:15,734 --> 00:32:19,599
My God, stop.
This is clearly my fault.

627
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,724
What? Why?

628
00:32:21,495 --> 00:32:22,620
No, I take
full responsibility for this.

629
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:23,724
Guys, this is
because the old me

630
00:32:24,495 --> 00:32:25,620
was clearly dragging
our stock down.

631
00:32:25,641 --> 00:32:29,693
I, like, feel bad for her.
I wanna like hug this girl.

632
00:32:29,713 --> 00:32:31,630
You look like you.

633
00:32:31,651 --> 00:32:34,495
All we have to do
are get new photos of me.

634
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:37,652
You know, like, a photo shoot
for the new Renee.

635
00:32:37,673 --> 00:32:41,725
Like maybe a hip-hop vibe.
Like St. Tropez.

636
00:32:42,652 --> 00:32:44,600
You know,
let's get this in a bikini,

637
00:32:44,694 --> 00:32:48,610
on a jet ski with,
like, Lil Wayne,

638
00:32:48,631 --> 00:32:51,600
or Lil' Bow Wow,
or one of the Lil's.

639
00:32:51,621 --> 00:32:52,694
I don't think that's a thing.

640
00:32:52,714 --> 00:32:53,714
Which thing?

641
00:32:53,735 --> 00:32:55,496
The whole...
Like, all those things.

642
00:32:55,517 --> 00:32:59,507
One of the... A big one...
Big... Medium George?

643
00:32:59,528 --> 00:33:00,611
I don't know who it is,
but it's going to be

644
00:33:00,632 --> 00:33:01,632
hip-hop
and it's going to be hot.

645
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:05,653
No, we're going to do it.
Hot bikini action.

646
00:33:05,705 --> 00:33:07,538
You know,
I don't have a yacht, but...

647
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:09,611
Does your brother
still have a kayak?

648
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,632
<i>Hi, this message</i>

649
00:33:10,653 --> 00:33:11,663
is for Renee Bennett.

650
00:33:11,684 --> 00:33:14,611
Please call Helen Grey's
office at Lily LeClaire

651
00:33:14,632 --> 00:33:17,612
to set up your interview
for the receptionist position.

652
00:33:40,603 --> 00:33:41,624
Renee Bennett?

653
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:43,717
Yeah. I'm Renee. Hi.

654
00:33:44,707 --> 00:33:46,572
No, I'm looking
for Renee Bennett

655
00:33:46,592 --> 00:33:47,634
for the receptionist job.

656
00:33:47,655 --> 00:33:49,624
That's me. Here.

657
00:33:51,572 --> 00:33:52,572
Okay.

658
00:33:56,582 --> 00:33:59,646
You must be Renee.
I'm Helen Grey, CFO.

659
00:33:59,666 --> 00:34:01,531
We spoke on the phone.

660
00:34:01,552 --> 00:34:03,635
And this is our CEO,
Avery LeClaire.

661
00:34:03,656 --> 00:34:04,656
Hello, Renee.

662
00:34:04,677 --> 00:34:05,677
Hello.

663
00:34:05,698 --> 00:34:07,562
Take a seat,
make yourself comfortable.

664
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,656
Thank you so much.

665
00:34:10,552 --> 00:34:13,593
Uh, it's nice to finally meet
you face to face, Ms. Grey.

666
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:16,739
And I of course know
who you are, Miss LeClaire.

667
00:34:17,583 --> 00:34:20,511
Renee currently works
in the online division.

668
00:34:20,542 --> 00:34:21,574
Oh, wow, super.

669
00:34:21,594 --> 00:34:25,553
Yeah, but I figure I can be
real with you guys,

670
00:34:25,574 --> 00:34:29,615
like Gayle King real, and say
that it would be a shame

671
00:34:29,647 --> 00:34:33,553
to waste all this in
a tiny Chinatown office.

672
00:34:34,501 --> 00:34:36,542
I think we've got more
of a front-of-house

673
00:34:36,563 --> 00:34:37,699
situation on our hands.

674
00:34:38,584 --> 00:34:40,574
Am I right or wrong?
Yeah.

675
00:34:40,594 --> 00:34:42,616
Renee, we appreciate
you taking the initiative,

676
00:34:42,637 --> 00:34:43,637
but you're not exactly

677
00:34:43,658 --> 00:34:44,700
the obvious choice
for this job.

678
00:34:46,512 --> 00:34:47,523
Helen.

679
00:34:48,648 --> 00:34:49,741
No, I totally get it.

680
00:34:50,575 --> 00:34:51,720
Because I already
work for the company,

681
00:34:51,741 --> 00:34:53,595
and this job would actually be

682
00:34:53,616 --> 00:34:55,668
a pay cut
to my current salary.

683
00:34:55,689 --> 00:34:57,700
It doesn't make much sense
why I'm here.

684
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,595
So what are your goals,
exactly?

685
00:35:02,565 --> 00:35:04,680
To work here

686
00:35:07,586 --> 00:35:09,513
as a receptionist.

687
00:35:09,576 --> 00:35:10,576
Wow.

688
00:35:12,555 --> 00:35:14,544
Okay, because most girls,
they view this

689
00:35:14,565 --> 00:35:16,617
as a stepping stone
to modeling

690
00:35:16,638 --> 00:35:19,607
or to opening their
own e-commerce boutique.

691
00:35:19,628 --> 00:35:23,577
I hear you. And yes,
modeling is an option for me.

692
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,577
You are taking a risk.

693
00:35:25,597 --> 00:35:27,660
Is this girl going to
walk out of this office

694
00:35:27,681 --> 00:35:30,566
and right onto the runway
and never look back?

695
00:35:30,681 --> 00:35:32,504
Is that realistic for me?

696
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:36,597
1,000%. But it's not who I am.

697
00:35:37,681 --> 00:35:40,629
My only real goal
is to come here

698
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:43,525
to this office every day,

699
00:35:43,702 --> 00:35:45,661
and help people feel
the same way I feel

700
00:35:45,682 --> 00:35:48,609
when I step off that elevator,

701
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:53,505
that this is
the only place to be.

702
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:08,693
Yes, yes,
yes, yes! I got it!

703
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,735
I work here now!

704
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:24,631
Mason, you in here?

705
00:36:25,662 --> 00:36:26,715
It's me, Renee.

706
00:36:26,736 --> 00:36:28,569
Can we talk in the office?

707
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,580
We can just talk here,
it's fine.

708
00:36:30,611 --> 00:36:32,600
Things have changed
for me, Mason.

709
00:36:32,684 --> 00:36:35,538
They're moving me to HQ.

710
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,590
It's headquarters.

711
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:39,663
Everything I've ever wanted...

712
00:36:39,684 --> 00:36:41,507
I really need you to leave.

713
00:36:41,527 --> 00:36:43,538
I really would rather
you not hear the splash.

714
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:44,642
Don't worry.

715
00:36:45,538 --> 00:36:47,549
I talked to them,
and HR is already

716
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:48,685
interviewing
for my replacement.

717
00:36:49,518 --> 00:36:51,539
HR is just human resources.

718
00:36:51,685 --> 00:36:53,612
Go, please. Go.

719
00:36:53,633 --> 00:36:55,653
And I know you're happy here.

720
00:36:55,674 --> 00:36:57,601
But anyway, I gotta go.

721
00:36:57,622 --> 00:36:59,518
If you just finally
got the courage

722
00:36:59,539 --> 00:37:01,706
to ask me out, it's too late,
buddy.

723
00:37:01,726 --> 00:37:03,591
Go please. Go.

724
00:37:04,601 --> 00:37:06,695
I'll miss you. You want me
to leave it open?

725
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:08,623
-No.
-No?

726
00:37:12,665 --> 00:37:13,665
Shit!

727
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,520
Whoo!

728
00:37:43,093 --> 00:37:44,207
You're gonna wanna
head to marketing,

729
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:46,041
and you're gonna wanna
have a great time.

730
00:37:47,093 --> 00:37:49,134
She's headed to you,
she's adorable.

731
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:54,239
Good morning.

732
00:37:56,177 --> 00:37:57,208
Hi, you know what,

733
00:37:57,229 --> 00:37:59,125
I think I pressed
the wrong floor.

734
00:37:59,146 --> 00:38:01,083
I'm looking for Lily LeClaire,
and this is not...

735
00:38:01,104 --> 00:38:02,104
Nope, that's us.

736
00:38:02,229 --> 00:38:03,271
Welcome to Lily LeClaire.

737
00:38:04,167 --> 00:38:07,073
You're probably used to seeing
Angie sit here,

738
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,260
but I promise
to win you over, too.

739
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,240
She served her bottle
of water room temp.

740
00:38:11,272 --> 00:38:14,095
Now, I prefer
to serve it chilled.

741
00:38:14,136 --> 00:38:16,178
I also serve it with a straw,

742
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:19,095
so you don't have to mess
with your fierce lipstick.

743
00:38:19,115 --> 00:38:20,251
God, I love that shade.

744
00:38:20,272 --> 00:38:24,147
What is it, Rogue Red?
Fall 2015?

745
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,178
I don't know any Angie.

746
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:29,251
What confused me
when I walked into this place,

747
00:38:29,272 --> 00:38:32,283
honestly, is you and...

748
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,189
I know, right?

749
00:38:36,283 --> 00:38:38,189
You're not the only one. Okay.

750
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:41,252
People don't expect a girl
sitting back here

751
00:38:41,273 --> 00:38:43,189
to just be so on the ball.

752
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:44,252
See, that's not what I was...

753
00:38:44,273 --> 00:38:46,200
But I know what it means
to work hard.

754
00:38:46,283 --> 00:38:48,262
And I don't plan on
coasting off the benis

755
00:38:48,283 --> 00:38:50,106
of this face or this body.

756
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:52,054
I'm going to bring it
every day.

757
00:38:52,189 --> 00:38:53,242
I can see by your portfolio

758
00:38:53,263 --> 00:38:55,128
that you're here
from the Rose Sheet,

759
00:38:55,169 --> 00:38:56,169
which happens to be

760
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:58,086
my absolute favorite
trade publication.

761
00:38:58,201 --> 00:39:01,055
So I'll let them know that
you're here for your 10:30,

762
00:39:01,076 --> 00:39:02,097
and you can have a seat.

763
00:39:02,117 --> 00:39:03,138
Or if you prefer,

764
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:05,180
get steps in to meet
your Fitbit goal for the day.

765
00:39:05,201 --> 00:39:06,294
This hallway loops around,

766
00:39:07,065 --> 00:39:08,242
and I'll let you know
when they're ready.

767
00:39:09,107 --> 00:39:11,201
Welcome to Lily LeClaire.

768
00:39:12,055 --> 00:39:13,055
Thanks.

769
00:39:13,076 --> 00:39:14,087
And my name is Renee,

770
00:39:14,108 --> 00:39:16,233
if you need
absolutely anything at all.

771
00:39:17,056 --> 00:39:18,191
Ever, ever.

772
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,077
Hi, Lily LeClaire,
you've got Renee.

773
00:39:22,098 --> 00:39:23,139
Oh, I'll put you through.

774
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,202
Hello, Renee.

775
00:39:29,223 --> 00:39:30,295
It's all right.
I overheard your name.

776
00:39:31,295 --> 00:39:33,139
I'm here to meet Avery,

777
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,099
but could you not make me wait
next to that lady.

778
00:39:36,255 --> 00:39:38,192
I don't think I'll be
as nice to her as you were.

779
00:39:39,286 --> 00:39:43,151
Oh, thank God. Okay, okay.

780
00:39:44,296 --> 00:39:46,192
You're Grant LeClaire.

781
00:39:46,213 --> 00:39:47,213
Yes.

782
00:39:47,234 --> 00:39:51,109
Holy shit. Holy shit.

783
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:52,286
Relax, you're good.

784
00:39:53,213 --> 00:39:55,213
Okay, okay.

785
00:39:55,234 --> 00:39:56,287
Right. Um...

786
00:39:57,162 --> 00:39:59,204
Well, Grant,
I noticed on <i>Page Six,</i>

787
00:39:59,297 --> 00:40:03,058
that you are often
photographed drinking

788
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:06,120
these Pressed Juicery
Greens 1.5.

789
00:40:06,141 --> 00:40:07,214
Correct? I saw that

790
00:40:07,235 --> 00:40:09,277
and I brought it here, in case
you were ever to come in.

791
00:40:10,297 --> 00:40:12,225
-Thank you.
-You're welcome,

792
00:40:12,245 --> 00:40:13,266
Grant LeClaire.

793
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,183
Sorry, what, you've seen me
holding these?

794
00:40:17,069 --> 00:40:18,236
So you got them in
just for me?

795
00:40:18,257 --> 00:40:20,257
I've also seen you holding
a lot of Brazilian models,

796
00:40:20,278 --> 00:40:22,163
but I didn't think they'd fit
in the mini-fridge.

797
00:40:27,142 --> 00:40:29,111
Okay, cool, I thought
you were gonna be mad

798
00:40:29,132 --> 00:40:30,298
'cause I called you out
so hard.

799
00:40:31,069 --> 00:40:32,090
Who hired you, Renee?

800
00:40:32,111 --> 00:40:35,080
Avery. Your sister.

801
00:40:35,153 --> 00:40:36,215
Yes, I know who she is.

802
00:40:36,236 --> 00:40:39,112
Good. 'Cause Thanksgiving
would be really weird.

803
00:40:39,164 --> 00:40:42,122
I don't know if you guys
do things like Thanksgiving.

804
00:40:42,143 --> 00:40:43,206
Yeah, we do.

805
00:40:43,227 --> 00:40:45,122
Oh, my God, that's crazy.

806
00:40:45,237 --> 00:40:46,299
So, Avery, huh?

807
00:40:48,299 --> 00:40:50,133
Good for her.

808
00:40:51,102 --> 00:40:52,102
Yes.

809
00:40:55,258 --> 00:40:57,081
Oh, my God.

810
00:41:02,061 --> 00:41:03,207
This is our first
diffusion line,

811
00:41:03,228 --> 00:41:05,228
and I really owe it
to my grandma

812
00:41:05,248 --> 00:41:06,269
to get it right.

813
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:10,092
We are at a critical stage
for both the product itself,

814
00:41:10,113 --> 00:41:11,280
and the packaging
and the copy.

815
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:14,207
So, now for the exciting part,
let's look at out samples.

816
00:41:14,228 --> 00:41:15,300
This is our...

817
00:41:16,175 --> 00:41:18,259
I'm so sorry. So sorry.

818
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,229
I am so sorry!

819
00:41:20,249 --> 00:41:22,239
Okay, going to put it all back
right where it was.

820
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,260
Here is the blush.

821
00:41:24,104 --> 00:41:26,291
All right, and here is
the packaging,

822
00:41:27,062 --> 00:41:28,281
and I just need to find
the application brush,

823
00:41:28,301 --> 00:41:30,197
and then we can move on
with our lives.

824
00:41:31,093 --> 00:41:33,062
There is no application brush.

825
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:35,291
Oh.

826
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:40,260
Really?

827
00:41:41,177 --> 00:41:42,219
Okay. Got it.

828
00:41:43,136 --> 00:41:44,219
Does that come
as a surprise to you?

829
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,240
Because if you knew
our products,

830
00:41:45,261 --> 00:41:46,271
you'd know that
our blush never comes

831
00:41:46,292 --> 00:41:48,105
with an application
blush brush.

832
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:49,125
Of course I know that.

833
00:41:49,146 --> 00:41:50,209
Same as the Shimmering
Face Powders.

834
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:53,188
I just figured
for this particular product,

835
00:41:53,209 --> 00:41:54,282
you know,
that there might be one.

836
00:41:54,302 --> 00:41:57,115
But never mind, you guys,
you know how this works,

837
00:41:57,136 --> 00:41:58,198
and I'm just
the beautiful face

838
00:41:58,219 --> 00:42:00,209
keeping this place running.
So...

839
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:03,178
I think we'd all like to hear
what you'd have to say, Renee.

840
00:42:08,064 --> 00:42:09,095
Well...

841
00:42:10,251 --> 00:42:13,126
Well, with high-end products,

842
00:42:13,147 --> 00:42:14,210
we expect our customers

843
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:16,303
to have high-end
makeup brushes.

844
00:42:17,189 --> 00:42:21,137
But regular girls
put their blush on

845
00:42:21,158 --> 00:42:22,178
in the rearview,

846
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:24,107
on the way
to their crappy jobs.

847
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,273
And they're going to be pissed

848
00:42:25,294 --> 00:42:28,096
when they open an $8.50 blush,

849
00:42:28,117 --> 00:42:29,304
and they have
no way they can use it.

850
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:31,284
Then you just wind up
using your finger.

851
00:42:32,086 --> 00:42:34,096
You know,
it never goes on right.

852
00:42:34,117 --> 00:42:36,294
Then you hit a bump,
or you have an itch

853
00:42:37,065 --> 00:42:39,242
and you wind up
looking like <i>Braveheart.</i>

854
00:42:41,086 --> 00:42:44,160
Or some more
up-to-date reference.

855
00:42:45,233 --> 00:42:47,170
That was very helpful, Renee.

856
00:42:47,201 --> 00:42:48,201
Really?

857
00:42:49,201 --> 00:42:51,087
Okay, great.

858
00:42:51,285 --> 00:42:54,076
If anybody needs anything,
any water or anything,

859
00:42:54,097 --> 00:42:55,118
just give me a signal.

860
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:57,128
The signal will
just be something like,

861
00:42:57,149 --> 00:42:59,305
"Renee, we could use
some more water."

862
00:43:00,243 --> 00:43:02,087
Or something, you know...

863
00:43:02,108 --> 00:43:05,161
"Thirsty, more water."

864
00:43:06,171 --> 00:43:07,171
Thank you.

865
00:43:27,255 --> 00:43:30,120
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hi, Ethan.

866
00:43:30,141 --> 00:43:31,162
Um...

867
00:43:31,245 --> 00:43:34,162
I know calling
a new love interest

868
00:43:34,182 --> 00:43:35,307
can be stressful,

869
00:43:36,297 --> 00:43:39,172
so I just wanted
to take that pressure off you.

870
00:43:39,193 --> 00:43:40,245
You know, you wonder like,

871
00:43:40,266 --> 00:43:42,182
"How long
should I wait to call?"

872
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:45,162
Or, "Is she too good for me?"
Blah, blah, blah.

873
00:43:47,152 --> 00:43:49,121
But, uh, I'm just gonna

874
00:43:49,142 --> 00:43:51,069
take all the heavy lifting
off of you

875
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:53,267
and let you know
that you are taking me out.

876
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,204
<i>Who is this again?</i>

877
00:43:56,142 --> 00:43:59,131
Oh, yeah,
Renee from the dry cleaner.

878
00:44:01,142 --> 00:44:02,246
Aren't you glad
we're doing this?

879
00:44:02,267 --> 00:44:04,298
I'm pretty scared of you,

880
00:44:05,069 --> 00:44:07,204
so I was a little afraid
to not do this.

881
00:44:07,225 --> 00:44:08,226
Right.

882
00:44:08,268 --> 00:44:09,268
So what do you do?

883
00:44:09,289 --> 00:44:12,257
Uh... I'm at CNN,
working in operations.

884
00:44:13,091 --> 00:44:14,226
It's not what I want to do.
I'm trying to segue

885
00:44:14,247 --> 00:44:15,268
-into being a cameraman...
-Oh.

886
00:44:15,289 --> 00:44:19,091
But it's sort of
a boys' club over there.

887
00:44:19,111 --> 00:44:21,111
So I can't just...

888
00:44:22,091 --> 00:44:23,091
What?

889
00:44:24,299 --> 00:44:26,091
Well, only girls complain

890
00:44:26,111 --> 00:44:27,226
about things
being a boys' club.

891
00:44:28,268 --> 00:44:29,269
Yes, good point,

892
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:30,290
but I mean it's like

893
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:32,248
a different breed
of, like, boys' club.

894
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:35,248
Like tattoos,
C-class driver's licenses.

895
00:44:35,269 --> 00:44:37,269
I'm sure you're just
in your head about it.

896
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:38,290
They call me "Wheat Thin."

897
00:44:39,144 --> 00:44:42,154
Because of "Ethan."
That's clever.

898
00:44:44,144 --> 00:44:46,112
"Wheat Thin-Ethan."
That is it!

899
00:44:46,133 --> 00:44:47,133
Hot dog.

900
00:44:47,154 --> 00:44:48,227
Wheat Thin-Ethan.

901
00:44:49,081 --> 00:44:50,301
That's not even as bad
as what I thought they meant.

902
00:44:51,082 --> 00:44:54,186
No, I mean, I used to be
where you are right now.

903
00:44:54,301 --> 00:44:58,228
I was working in this
tiny office, like tiny.

904
00:44:59,124 --> 00:45:01,311
And I never thought
I'd make it to 5th Avenue.

905
00:45:03,186 --> 00:45:07,103
But, I mean, look at me now.
I'm a receptionist.

906
00:45:08,124 --> 00:45:10,197
I haven't
said that out loud yet.

907
00:45:10,218 --> 00:45:14,239
I, Renee, am a receptionist.

908
00:45:15,292 --> 00:45:18,271
Oh, that was my hot dog.
You ate both of them.

909
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:21,312
Ooh, a bikini contest!
We're going!

910
00:45:24,302 --> 00:45:26,229
You sure this is
where you want to be?

911
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:28,125
There's a bar
just down the thing,

912
00:45:28,146 --> 00:45:29,281
they're doing
Latin rhythms night.

913
00:45:29,302 --> 00:45:31,135
Oh, we should hit that next.

914
00:45:31,167 --> 00:45:33,178
Yeah. Or sooner.

915
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:36,230
Right here.
Anybody sitting here? No?

916
00:45:36,251 --> 00:45:38,084
You sure no one's
sitting here?

917
00:45:38,105 --> 00:45:39,136
Yeah, it's, like, starting.

918
00:45:39,157 --> 00:45:41,230
You know, I'm cool with this.

919
00:45:41,251 --> 00:45:45,147
As long as you're
comfortable sitting here

920
00:45:45,168 --> 00:45:47,313
while these women
are kind of naked.

921
00:45:48,084 --> 00:45:49,272
Kind of? They look great.

922
00:45:50,272 --> 00:45:51,293
What are you doing?

923
00:45:51,313 --> 00:45:53,085
Well, I don't have
a bathing suit,

924
00:45:53,106 --> 00:45:54,106
so I have to improvise.

925
00:45:54,273 --> 00:45:57,116
Kind of hotter
than a bathing suit,

926
00:45:57,137 --> 00:45:58,241
because it's, like,
unexpected,

927
00:45:58,262 --> 00:46:00,096
and you can, like,
see most of my butt.

928
00:46:00,116 --> 00:46:01,273
Wait, are you entering
the bikini contest?

929
00:46:01,294 --> 00:46:02,314
-Yeah!
-No!

930
00:46:03,096 --> 00:46:04,314
It's 500 bucks to the winner.
Did you see the sign?

931
00:46:05,085 --> 00:46:06,189
Yeah, but I think
that you probably

932
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:08,169
had to pre-register online,

933
00:46:08,189 --> 00:46:09,252
and then there's
also the issue

934
00:46:09,273 --> 00:46:11,158
of the non-regulation bikini.

935
00:46:11,179 --> 00:46:12,210
Honestly,
that Latin rhythms night...

936
00:46:12,231 --> 00:46:13,262
It'll be more fun.

937
00:46:13,283 --> 00:46:15,149
Oh, wait,
I see what's going on.

938
00:46:16,097 --> 00:46:17,107
You're worried that the guys

939
00:46:17,128 --> 00:46:18,305
are going to be drooling
all over me.

940
00:46:19,086 --> 00:46:22,107
-Uh-uh.
-Oh, my God, that's so sweet.

941
00:46:22,128 --> 00:46:25,232
But don't worry, okay?
I'm here with you.

942
00:46:26,253 --> 00:46:29,232
I came with you
and I'm leaving with you.

943
00:46:30,138 --> 00:46:32,263
But I do need your help
with something.

944
00:46:33,211 --> 00:46:36,139
Now, what do you think?
Shoe on or shoe off?

945
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,087
-This is off.
-Right.

946
00:46:38,108 --> 00:46:39,108
This is me with it on.

947
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:41,160
Does it say, like, "Barefoot
hippie, she doesn't care..."

948
00:46:41,181 --> 00:46:43,108
Honestly,
at the end of the day,

949
00:46:43,129 --> 00:46:44,160
I don't know
if it's gonna have

950
00:46:44,181 --> 00:46:45,233
a dramatic effect either way,

951
00:46:45,254 --> 00:46:46,254
so I would go shoes on

952
00:46:46,275 --> 00:46:48,202
because the carpet
is disgusting.

953
00:46:48,223 --> 00:46:50,129
Okay, cool. Wish me luck.

954
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:52,264
-Good luck. Yeah.
-I got this.

955
00:46:54,223 --> 00:46:56,088
So scared.

956
00:46:56,109 --> 00:47:01,151
Welcome to the semi-annual
Ruby's Bangin' Bikini Contest.

957
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:03,192
We're going to start it out,
and do it proud.

958
00:47:03,213 --> 00:47:05,255
Here she comes everybody,
let's bring out our girls.

959
00:47:06,078 --> 00:47:07,192
Lacey J.

960
00:47:07,213 --> 00:47:09,099
She's pursuing her certificate

961
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:11,119
in heating
and cooling maintenance.

962
00:47:11,192 --> 00:47:13,151
Fire and ice, she sure is!

963
00:47:13,307 --> 00:47:16,172
Is there a doctor
in the house? No!

964
00:47:16,192 --> 00:47:18,079
But there is
a dental assistant

965
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:19,120
and her name is Tiffany!

966
00:47:20,256 --> 00:47:22,110
Look at that!

967
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:23,214
Oh! Whoa!

968
00:47:23,235 --> 00:47:25,183
Work it out, honey!

969
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:28,100
Watch out, guys,
it's about to heat up!

970
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,100
Because here comes Vanessa!

971
00:47:30,152 --> 00:47:33,204
Our Vanessa here has been
to 11 of our United States.

972
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:35,266
So give it up for Vanessa!

973
00:47:35,298 --> 00:47:38,215
Oh, we've got
a late entry here.

974
00:47:38,299 --> 00:47:40,299
I hope her buns are tighter
than this penmanship

975
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:43,121
'cause this is really
hard to read.

976
00:47:43,278 --> 00:47:47,142
But keep it going
for Renee Bennett?

977
00:47:47,163 --> 00:47:48,163
Renee Bennett.

978
00:47:51,194 --> 00:47:53,246
Whoa, are you here
for the barback job?

979
00:47:54,278 --> 00:47:55,299
You're in the contest? Okay.

980
00:47:55,319 --> 00:47:57,309
-I got it. I got it.
<i>-You got it? Okay.</i>

981
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:02,185
Hello, everyone, I am Renee!
As advertised!

982
00:48:02,258 --> 00:48:06,133
Renee hails
from the Long Island,

983
00:48:06,154 --> 00:48:08,216
and she is a receptionist.

984
00:48:08,258 --> 00:48:10,164
Holler!

985
00:48:10,206 --> 00:48:12,195
Um, Renee enjoys
watching people

986
00:48:12,216 --> 00:48:14,154
trying to cover up
their disappointment

987
00:48:14,175 --> 00:48:17,154
from their dreams being
shattered on shows such as

988
00:48:17,175 --> 00:48:20,134
Antiques Roadshow
Shark Tank.<i>and </i>

989
00:48:20,269 --> 00:48:22,238
And Renee is not afraid

990
00:48:22,259 --> 00:48:26,248
of returning things
for store credit!

991
00:48:29,092 --> 00:48:31,123
Renee was kicked out not once,

992
00:48:31,144 --> 00:48:32,144
but twice from

993
00:48:32,165 --> 00:48:33,290
a New Kids
on the Block concert

994
00:48:33,311 --> 00:48:35,321
for crying too hard.

995
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,311
Joey! Am I right? Joey!

996
00:48:41,083 --> 00:48:42,083
Marry me!

997
00:48:42,104 --> 00:48:44,197
And although you ladies all
seem super chill,

998
00:48:44,218 --> 00:48:45,260
I did not come here

999
00:48:45,281 --> 00:48:47,270
<i>- to make friends. Okay?</i>

1000
00:48:48,197 --> 00:48:50,124
DJ, hit it!

1001
00:50:24,316 --> 00:50:27,265
And now it's time
to tally the votes.

1002
00:50:27,286 --> 00:50:29,098
Are you guys ready?

1003
00:50:31,234 --> 00:50:35,098
The winner of this year's
Ruby's Bangin' Bikini Contest,

1004
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:39,088
Lacey J. from New Brunswick,
New Jersey! Lacey!

1005
00:50:42,223 --> 00:50:45,286
Take a lap! Come on, Lacey!
Beautiful!

1006
00:50:47,141 --> 00:50:49,141
Don't worry, Romeo,
she'll be right out.

1007
00:50:49,162 --> 00:50:51,172
Yeah, I didn't know
if they go backstage.

1008
00:50:51,193 --> 00:50:52,214
Is there a backstage here?

1009
00:50:52,235 --> 00:50:54,110
Yeah, it usually leads
to a rehab.

1010
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:56,089
But that Renee?
That's your girl, right?

1011
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,193
-Uh... Friend for now.
-Friend?

1012
00:50:58,214 --> 00:51:00,162
Just friend, this is
our first kind of night out.

1013
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,328
All right, I didn't ask
for a podcast.

1014
00:51:02,099 --> 00:51:04,318
Either way, your lady
killed it tonight.

1015
00:51:05,089 --> 00:51:06,089
She is awesome.

1016
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:07,214
She is the complete package.

1017
00:51:07,235 --> 00:51:09,204
Yeah, I'm getting
to know that.

1018
00:51:09,225 --> 00:51:11,308
Um, I've never seen
anything like that.

1019
00:51:11,329 --> 00:51:13,111
Now the girl who won,

1020
00:51:13,131 --> 00:51:15,142
who happens to be
my god-niece,

1021
00:51:15,163 --> 00:51:17,152
of course, she was hotter.

1022
00:51:17,173 --> 00:51:18,329
But let's say this,

1023
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:21,131
it's a lonely dark night,
you got a flat.

1024
00:51:21,152 --> 00:51:22,204
Who do you want next to you?

1025
00:51:22,256 --> 00:51:24,100
Your girl. Yeah.

1026
00:51:24,121 --> 00:51:25,204
Your girl can handle herself

1027
00:51:25,225 --> 00:51:27,194
in a knife fight,
and I like that.

1028
00:51:27,215 --> 00:51:28,215
Dude, up here.

1029
00:51:28,236 --> 00:51:29,237
Uh, thank you.

1030
00:51:29,257 --> 00:51:30,268
Tonight's your night,
good luck.

1031
00:51:34,247 --> 00:51:36,268
-Hey, that was so great.
-Hi.

1032
00:51:36,289 --> 00:51:38,195
Sorry, I got you all wet.

1033
00:51:38,216 --> 00:51:40,278
Oh, yeah, that's water, right?

1034
00:51:41,112 --> 00:51:42,268
Yeah, I think it's water.

1035
00:51:43,122 --> 00:51:45,299
I'm sorry it didn't go
the way you wanted it to.

1036
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,184
I mean, it was awesome.

1037
00:51:47,205 --> 00:51:50,258
Yeah. No, it didn't.
It went way better.

1038
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:51,310
What?

1039
00:51:51,331 --> 00:51:54,217
We each get two free drinks
and an appetizer!

1040
00:51:54,238 --> 00:51:55,279
That's what I was hoping.

1041
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:57,165
-On the house.
-What are the parting gifts?

1042
00:51:57,185 --> 00:51:58,269
I was looking
at the coconut shrimp

1043
00:51:58,290 --> 00:51:59,310
'cause I didn't get
any hot dog.

1044
00:52:00,123 --> 00:52:01,217
You snooze,
you lose your hot dog.

1045
00:52:01,238 --> 00:52:02,238
You're really not upset?

1046
00:52:02,258 --> 00:52:03,321
No, not really.

1047
00:52:04,092 --> 00:52:07,196
I mean, these things are
so, like, political.

1048
00:52:08,133 --> 00:52:09,331
-Yeah.
-I won't get into all of it.

1049
00:52:10,102 --> 00:52:12,124
Mostly because
I have no information...

1050
00:52:12,218 --> 00:52:13,311
No, I can see
a place like this

1051
00:52:13,332 --> 00:52:14,332
running kind of a shady...

1052
00:52:15,103 --> 00:52:16,259
Yeah. I feel like I did win.

1053
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,166
The crowd was going crazy.

1054
00:52:18,186 --> 00:52:21,249
And you know what,
I know I look good.

1055
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:24,301
I don't need some, like, room
of drunk guys to confirm that.

1056
00:52:25,186 --> 00:52:27,322
Can I be you when I grow up?

1057
00:52:29,124 --> 00:52:31,124
You should've won,
you were ripped off.

1058
00:52:32,156 --> 00:52:33,156
Thanks.

1059
00:52:33,177 --> 00:52:34,260
I think I've earned this,
right?

1060
00:52:34,333 --> 00:52:37,271
That was just sitting there.
That's not even mine.

1061
00:52:37,292 --> 00:52:39,250
Mmm.

1062
00:52:44,271 --> 00:52:46,208
Renee.

1063
00:52:46,229 --> 00:52:47,333
I thought I smelled
animal products.

1064
00:52:48,125 --> 00:52:50,156
-Mmm.
-Can I ask you something?

1065
00:52:50,177 --> 00:52:51,177
Mmm-hmm.

1066
00:52:51,198 --> 00:52:53,147
Just because you seem to have
such great insight

1067
00:52:53,168 --> 00:52:55,136
about our diffusion line
earlier.

1068
00:52:55,168 --> 00:52:58,209
Yeah, of course.
I'm here to help.

1069
00:52:59,157 --> 00:53:02,147
My grandma is coming
to review everything

1070
00:53:02,168 --> 00:53:04,168
for the big pitch to the
Target people in Boston,

1071
00:53:04,188 --> 00:53:05,199
and I just really
want to make sure

1072
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:06,261
that I get everything right.

1073
00:53:07,334 --> 00:53:09,178
Super, yeah.

1074
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:12,220
-Oh!
-So, I had this great idea.

1075
00:53:13,105 --> 00:53:14,294
You know how
at our traditional outlets

1076
00:53:14,314 --> 00:53:15,335
like Bergdorf's
or Bloomingdale's,

1077
00:53:16,106 --> 00:53:17,314
we have a dedicated makeup
counter with a specialist

1078
00:53:17,335 --> 00:53:18,335
to help teach
about the products

1079
00:53:19,106 --> 00:53:20,106
and how to apply them.

1080
00:53:20,127 --> 00:53:22,127
I thought what if,
even at Target,

1081
00:53:22,148 --> 00:53:23,148
during our peak hours,

1082
00:53:23,169 --> 00:53:24,169
we offer the same thing

1083
00:53:24,189 --> 00:53:25,252
to our diffusion line
customers.

1084
00:53:27,252 --> 00:53:28,252
Yeah.

1085
00:53:28,325 --> 00:53:30,148
Oh, shit, you hate it.

1086
00:53:31,127 --> 00:53:32,169
No, I don't hate it.

1087
00:53:32,189 --> 00:53:34,127
No, if you think it's a shitty
idea, please tell me,

1088
00:53:34,148 --> 00:53:36,118
'cause I am really freaking
out about this whole thing.

1089
00:53:36,232 --> 00:53:37,232
From what I can gather,

1090
00:53:37,253 --> 00:53:39,128
just, you know,
from my friends,

1091
00:53:39,295 --> 00:53:41,305
those professionals
at the makeup counter

1092
00:53:41,326 --> 00:53:43,128
are actually a deterrent.

1093
00:53:43,274 --> 00:53:45,253
There's these, like, beautiful

1094
00:53:45,274 --> 00:53:47,336
statuesque women
just staring at you,

1095
00:53:48,305 --> 00:53:51,284
with your pimples and your
asymmetrical face,

1096
00:53:51,305 --> 00:53:54,128
and they just make you
feel bad about yourself.

1097
00:53:54,211 --> 00:53:56,191
I mean, it makes them
feel bad about themselves.

1098
00:53:56,212 --> 00:53:58,181
That's why these regular girls

1099
00:53:58,202 --> 00:54:02,139
flock to the anonymous aisles
of a big superstore.

1100
00:54:02,264 --> 00:54:04,160
So they can just go in
and buy their makeup

1101
00:54:04,181 --> 00:54:06,233
without somebody
standing there,

1102
00:54:06,254 --> 00:54:09,160
making them just feel like
they're not good enough.

1103
00:54:09,337 --> 00:54:11,337
Like it's a waste of time
to even try.

1104
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:14,275
I'm just a stupid idiot,
dumb bitch.

1105
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:17,099
Oh, my God. You?
No, you're not.

1106
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,213
You're, like, amazing.

1107
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,338
You're everything I could
ever want to be.

1108
00:54:22,161 --> 00:54:23,172
It's this voice.

1109
00:54:24,265 --> 00:54:26,265
Your voice? You...

1110
00:54:27,151 --> 00:54:29,182
Something wrong
with your voice?

1111
00:54:29,203 --> 00:54:30,276
I haven't noticed anything...

1112
00:54:30,297 --> 00:54:32,109
It's a little high-pitched.

1113
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:33,276
I sound like a freaking moron.

1114
00:54:33,297 --> 00:54:34,328
-No.
-But I'm not...

1115
00:54:35,099 --> 00:54:36,338
I've got
a JD/MBA from Wharton.

1116
00:54:37,109 --> 00:54:38,339
I clerked for
a Supreme Court Justice.

1117
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:40,162
But it's this voice,
I can't kick it.

1118
00:54:40,183 --> 00:54:41,329
I've tried everything.
Vocal coaches...

1119
00:54:44,121 --> 00:54:45,235
That's it, actually,
just vocal coaches,

1120
00:54:45,256 --> 00:54:46,339
but still nothing.

1121
00:54:47,110 --> 00:54:48,110
Coaches, okay.

1122
00:54:48,298 --> 00:54:49,298
That's why I feel really lucky

1123
00:54:49,318 --> 00:54:51,173
to have someone
like you here, Renee.

1124
00:54:51,193 --> 00:54:52,308
Someone like me?

1125
00:54:52,329 --> 00:54:54,100
Someone who knows
the clientele

1126
00:54:54,121 --> 00:54:55,121
that we're going after,

1127
00:54:55,141 --> 00:54:57,121
someone who can
speak to that world.

1128
00:54:57,193 --> 00:54:58,193
Yeah.

1129
00:54:58,225 --> 00:55:00,299
There's a dinner coming up.
I'd love for you to come.

1130
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:02,267
A dinner? Oh, my gosh.

1131
00:55:02,288 --> 00:55:04,205
You can bring
your boyfriend or your

1132
00:55:05,246 --> 00:55:10,153
girlfriend or however
they identify,

1133
00:55:10,174 --> 00:55:12,121
just, if you have one.

1134
00:55:12,184 --> 00:55:13,319
No, I... Uh...

1135
00:55:14,121 --> 00:55:16,174
I guess I actually...
I do have somebody

1136
00:55:16,215 --> 00:55:18,299
that I could invite
right now. Yeah.

1137
00:55:19,184 --> 00:55:21,206
And he identifies as a guy.

1138
00:55:21,227 --> 00:55:24,289
I mean, he's... There are some
very feminine aspects to him,

1139
00:55:24,310 --> 00:55:27,185
but it's part of his charm.
You'll see.

1140
00:55:27,206 --> 00:55:28,216
Okay, good.

1141
00:55:40,624 --> 00:55:41,624
Hey.

1142
00:55:41,801 --> 00:55:42,811
Hi.

1143
00:55:42,832 --> 00:55:44,686
-Ready to get some dinner?
-Yeah, I'm starving.

1144
00:55:44,718 --> 00:55:45,749
-All right, let's do it.
-Yeah.

1145
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:47,718
-Okay.
-Pretty hungry myself.

1146
00:55:47,749 --> 00:55:48,749
Where you coming from?

1147
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:51,603
Oh, I was just, uh,
down the street.

1148
00:55:51,624 --> 00:55:52,780
Nowhere, hanging out.

1149
00:55:53,624 --> 00:55:54,624
You're sweaty.

1150
00:55:54,811 --> 00:55:56,749
I was working out,
but I showered.

1151
00:55:56,801 --> 00:55:57,801
-Okay.
-Yeah.

1152
00:55:59,593 --> 00:56:00,645
Were you at Zumba?

1153
00:56:01,719 --> 00:56:02,812
Zumba?
Is that what it's called?

1154
00:56:03,594 --> 00:56:04,812
I don't...
I never pay attention.

1155
00:56:04,833 --> 00:56:07,635
Yeah. Yeah, it's called Zumba.

1156
00:56:07,656 --> 00:56:10,750
It's pretty...
Like a female workout.

1157
00:56:10,771 --> 00:56:11,812
That's, like, a girl's...

1158
00:56:13,646 --> 00:56:14,719
- Is it?
- Yes!

1159
00:56:14,781 --> 00:56:16,802
I don't... It's a workout.

1160
00:56:17,614 --> 00:56:18,656
-I don't go to gyms...
-Oh, my God...

1161
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,729
...'cause I don't like
all the machismo,

1162
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:21,718
so I go where the ladies go.

1163
00:56:21,812 --> 00:56:23,719
-Oh, I get it.
-Not a big deal. Get what?

1164
00:56:23,772 --> 00:56:24,772
You're that guy.

1165
00:56:24,803 --> 00:56:26,751
"Go to the gym
to pick up chicks" guy.

1166
00:56:26,844 --> 00:56:30,699
I am 100% not the "go to
the gym to meet chicks" guy.

1167
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:31,730
Really? Zumba?

1168
00:56:31,751 --> 00:56:33,636
No, I am the guy

1169
00:56:33,657 --> 00:56:34,667
who sits
next to you for, like,

1170
00:56:34,688 --> 00:56:36,730
four years in high school
and wants to ask you out,

1171
00:56:36,751 --> 00:56:38,792
but I chicken out
like I always do,

1172
00:56:38,813 --> 00:56:40,626
and then I get online

1173
00:56:40,657 --> 00:56:41,813
and monitor your status
for 10 years,

1174
00:56:41,844 --> 00:56:43,814
hoping that you'll be single
at the reunion,

1175
00:56:43,835 --> 00:56:44,845
but if you're not,
you're married,

1176
00:56:45,627 --> 00:56:46,845
that's great, don't care.

1177
00:56:47,627 --> 00:56:48,814
-You're happy for her?
-I'm happy for her.

1178
00:56:49,741 --> 00:56:51,627
That's not real, by the way.
By the way, that's not real.

1179
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:52,658
That's me painting a picture.

1180
00:56:52,689 --> 00:56:54,689
-That sounded pretty real.
-I mean...

1181
00:56:55,679 --> 00:56:56,689
Let's go to dinner.

1182
00:56:56,710 --> 00:56:58,627
When I started to say it,
I regretted it.

1183
00:56:58,658 --> 00:56:59,814
What was the picture's name?

1184
00:57:00,658 --> 00:57:01,679
Rachel.

1185
00:57:07,753 --> 00:57:09,815
Yeah. You can have one grape.

1186
00:57:11,721 --> 00:57:14,846
Where have you met the girls
you've mostly dated? You know?

1187
00:57:15,784 --> 00:57:21,742
Uh... Well, honestly,
I don't date that much.

1188
00:57:22,628 --> 00:57:23,774
Well, that's really weird.

1189
00:57:24,794 --> 00:57:25,795
-Is it?
-'Cause neither do I.

1190
00:57:25,816 --> 00:57:26,827
-What?
-No, I really don't.

1191
00:57:26,847 --> 00:57:27,847
I know it seems like...

1192
00:57:28,629 --> 00:57:29,670
You're saying it
'cause I said it.

1193
00:57:29,691 --> 00:57:31,660
No, it seems like I have
all this experience, I know,

1194
00:57:31,681 --> 00:57:32,785
and that's kind of like
what I put out there,

1195
00:57:32,816 --> 00:57:35,681
but I've dated...

1196
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:38,629
I've been
in three relationships.

1197
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:39,660
-Really?
-Yeah,

1198
00:57:39,681 --> 00:57:41,722
and one of them had
a girlfriend. I didn't know.

1199
00:57:41,806 --> 00:57:43,691
I did not know. We were dating
for a couple months,

1200
00:57:43,722 --> 00:57:45,691
and then I get a phone call
from this girl,

1201
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:47,651
like, "This is his
girlfriend," I was like...

1202
00:57:47,817 --> 00:57:48,817
-Oh...
-"This is his girlfriend."

1203
00:57:48,848 --> 00:57:49,848
Yeah.

1204
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:53,692
I would cry so hard.
Did you cry?

1205
00:57:54,661 --> 00:57:55,671
Don't answer that.

1206
00:57:55,692 --> 00:57:56,755
-Don't answer that.
-Yes, I cried.

1207
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:58,723
-Why did I ask if you cried?
-No, you're a sensitive...

1208
00:57:58,755 --> 00:58:00,755
Ah! That's not what
a dude would ask.

1209
00:58:00,786 --> 00:58:03,734
What about... Is that
your class over there?

1210
00:58:03,755 --> 00:58:05,651
-Do you want to... No...
-Okay.

1211
00:58:05,692 --> 00:58:07,693
I'm strictly indoor Zumba.

1212
00:58:07,714 --> 00:58:08,808
I would never
do outdoor Zumba.

1213
00:58:08,839 --> 00:58:10,745
What's the move they're doing
right now called?

1214
00:58:10,777 --> 00:58:12,683
That's called
the star hop.

1215
00:58:12,714 --> 00:58:14,756
It's not a full jump.

1216
00:58:15,756 --> 00:58:16,777
You are...

1217
00:58:17,652 --> 00:58:18,839
You are quite a man, Ethan.

1218
00:58:21,662 --> 00:58:22,849
I got to read more <i>Maxim</i>
or something.

1219
00:58:23,652 --> 00:58:25,724
Ew, please don't read <i>Maxim.</i>
You're perfect.

1220
00:58:25,745 --> 00:58:26,849
I'm not perfect,

1221
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:30,757
but I do think that you are.

1222
00:58:32,694 --> 00:58:33,705
Whatever, Wheat-Thin.

1223
00:58:33,725 --> 00:58:34,725
I'm being serious.

1224
00:58:36,621 --> 00:58:37,663
You're, like, so yourself

1225
00:58:38,778 --> 00:58:40,725
or something,
I don't know, it's cool.

1226
00:58:40,746 --> 00:58:43,632
No, keep talking.

1227
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:47,725
Uh, I think a lot of people
are confused about themselves.

1228
00:58:48,621 --> 00:58:52,695
They, like, obsess over
whatever negative quality

1229
00:58:52,726 --> 00:58:54,851
they perceive in themselves
and they completely miss

1230
00:58:55,633 --> 00:58:58,695
the thing that really
makes them awesome.

1231
00:59:00,622 --> 00:59:02,633
You, like, know who you are

1232
00:59:02,654 --> 00:59:04,841
and you don't really care
how the world sees you.

1233
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:09,758
You're so yourself, too.

1234
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:12,790
I mean, you have no idea
who you are.

1235
00:59:13,634 --> 00:59:15,665
No, but you're honest
about it.

1236
00:59:15,759 --> 00:59:17,727
And it just
makes me feel really,

1237
00:59:18,811 --> 00:59:20,759
I don't know, close to you.

1238
00:59:21,821 --> 00:59:22,821
Are you going to kiss me?

1239
00:59:23,759 --> 00:59:25,821
I was just gonna

1240
00:59:25,852 --> 00:59:27,613
get as close as I could...

1241
00:59:27,634 --> 00:59:28,634
Uh-huh.

1242
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:30,717
-To tell you...
-Yeah?

1243
00:59:30,852 --> 00:59:31,853
That I...

1244
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:33,635
You have a girlfriend?

1245
00:59:33,666 --> 00:59:35,687
That I would love to kiss you.

1246
00:59:44,853 --> 00:59:46,624
Just give me
one minute.

1247
00:59:46,728 --> 00:59:48,718
Yeah, no worries,
take your time.

1248
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:54,698
-Hey.
-Hey. Hey...

1249
00:59:57,667 --> 00:59:58,667
Wow.

1250
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:02,636
I thought you might want a
sneak peek of what's to come.

1251
01:00:02,667 --> 01:00:05,761
I don't know if you know
what "sneak peek" means.

1252
01:00:05,792 --> 01:00:07,698
You're completely naked.

1253
01:00:08,667 --> 01:00:10,698
Oh, how embarrassing.

1254
01:00:10,813 --> 01:00:11,854
Do you want me to go cover up?

1255
01:00:12,667 --> 01:00:13,668
No.

1256
01:00:14,637 --> 01:00:15,699
No?

1257
01:00:15,783 --> 01:00:16,793
No.

1258
01:00:16,814 --> 01:00:17,824
Cool.

1259
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:22,793
Okay.

1260
01:00:25,824 --> 01:00:27,730
-Ethan, are you coming?
-Yup.

1261
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:40,690
Hi.

1262
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:42,669
Thanks for coming over.

1263
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:06,857
-Um...
-What?

1264
01:01:08,764 --> 01:01:12,774
Yeah, I want you to see me.
You know?

1265
01:01:12,795 --> 01:01:14,639
Oh, yeah, no, 100%.

1266
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:16,786
I'm definitely
loving seeing you.

1267
01:01:17,786 --> 01:01:22,733
I just didn't know
if you wanted to see me.

1268
01:01:23,817 --> 01:01:24,827
No, I want to see you.

1269
01:01:25,702 --> 01:01:26,702
-Okay.
-Yeah.

1270
01:01:28,733 --> 01:01:30,629
Oh, my God.

1271
01:01:30,671 --> 01:01:31,733
Oh...

1272
01:01:31,754 --> 01:01:32,765
Oh, my God!

1273
01:01:37,828 --> 01:01:39,672
Are you looking in the mirror?

1274
01:01:40,766 --> 01:01:41,766
Yeah. Yeah.

1275
01:01:44,724 --> 01:01:45,859
Oh, that is so hot.

1276
01:01:49,641 --> 01:01:50,734
It felt good the whole time.

1277
01:01:50,755 --> 01:01:51,859
-The whole time?
-The whole time.

1278
01:01:52,641 --> 01:01:54,693
-That was my favorite part.
-This is perfect.

1279
01:01:54,828 --> 01:01:56,693
I liked the whole time.

1280
01:01:56,734 --> 01:01:59,642
Yeah, and you were
such a great leader.

1281
01:01:59,673 --> 01:02:00,756
You really took over.

1282
01:02:02,756 --> 01:02:05,621
Thank you, and you
follow the leader well.

1283
01:02:05,642 --> 01:02:06,735
I was willing to do...

1284
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:07,860
Wait, shh... Do you hear that?

1285
01:02:08,673 --> 01:02:09,860
-What is it?
-Is that the ice cream man?

1286
01:02:10,725 --> 01:02:11,767
I think that's
the ice cream man.

1287
01:02:15,631 --> 01:02:16,704
Oh, no,
it's just an ambulance.

1288
01:02:16,725 --> 01:02:19,736
Renee, you're just naked
at the window.

1289
01:02:19,768 --> 01:02:20,851
Everybody down there
can see you.

1290
01:02:21,663 --> 01:02:23,861
Well, they're welcome.

1291
01:02:25,674 --> 01:02:28,695
-It's a good neighborhood.
-Uh... How...

1292
01:02:29,851 --> 01:02:30,861
How do you do that?

1293
01:02:31,705 --> 01:02:32,736
Do what?

1294
01:02:32,768 --> 01:02:35,695
I don't know,
have all of the confidence?

1295
01:02:36,705 --> 01:02:37,705
I wasn't always like that.

1296
01:02:37,799 --> 01:02:38,799
And what changed?

1297
01:02:39,674 --> 01:02:42,800
I started to
really believe that

1298
01:02:43,821 --> 01:02:46,862
if I wanted it bad enough,
all my dreams could come true.

1299
01:02:47,789 --> 01:02:49,758
And they are. You know?

1300
01:02:50,706 --> 01:02:51,706
Yeah.

1301
01:02:54,737 --> 01:02:55,737
That is the ice cream man.

1302
01:02:55,769 --> 01:02:56,800
Okay. That might be
the ice cream man.

1303
01:03:07,801 --> 01:03:09,645
All right, follow me
right this way.

1304
01:03:09,676 --> 01:03:10,822
Your guests are
in the private dining room.

1305
01:03:12,738 --> 01:03:13,832
Private dining room?

1306
01:03:13,853 --> 01:03:15,665
Mmm.

1307
01:03:15,770 --> 01:03:17,655
It must be
a company-wide thing,

1308
01:03:17,676 --> 01:03:18,832
or I wouldn't have
been invited.

1309
01:03:21,645 --> 01:03:23,708
Okay.

1310
01:03:23,739 --> 01:03:24,791
-What the...
-Sorry.

1311
01:03:28,729 --> 01:03:31,760
That's a very small company.

1312
01:03:32,729 --> 01:03:33,802
So, how did you two meet?

1313
01:03:33,864 --> 01:03:37,771
Uh, we actually met
at the dry cleaners.

1314
01:03:38,864 --> 01:03:41,708
I had vomited sangria,
like, all over a sweater.

1315
01:03:41,739 --> 01:03:42,739
It was pretty romantic.

1316
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:44,709
- Sounds magical.
- Yeah.

1317
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:47,803
So, Renee, I was just
telling Gram here about

1318
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:49,855
all our great ideas
for the diffusion line.

1319
01:03:50,772 --> 01:03:52,740
-Hmm.
-Cool. Yeah.

1320
01:03:52,834 --> 01:03:53,834
Great ideas.

1321
01:03:54,647 --> 01:03:57,709
Yeah, oh, they're so great.

1322
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,626
Mmm-hmm.

1323
01:03:59,647 --> 01:04:00,792
Wow, you're really
nailing this, Avery.

1324
01:04:00,824 --> 01:04:02,709
Avery, relax, dear.

1325
01:04:04,741 --> 01:04:07,679
Renee, Avery
obviously wants you here

1326
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:10,627
in order to legitimize
her whole plan for the line.

1327
01:04:10,648 --> 01:04:11,648
Gram.

1328
01:04:11,679 --> 01:04:13,679
I mean, Avery
has been incredible.

1329
01:04:13,741 --> 01:04:15,825
I still can't believe
I even get to work with her.

1330
01:04:16,637 --> 01:04:17,825
Oh, my God.
Is that Hidden Valley?

1331
01:04:18,679 --> 01:04:19,679
Only the best, my dear.

1332
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:21,710
Oh, my God, that is
my absolute favorite.

1333
01:04:21,866 --> 01:04:23,762
In high school, I would just
eat it by the spoonful.

1334
01:04:23,825 --> 01:04:25,794
And by spoonful,
I mean I would just chug it.

1335
01:04:25,826 --> 01:04:29,638
You know,
KFC actually uses HV.

1336
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:32,711
But nobody knows, because they
put it in their KFC packaging.

1337
01:04:32,732 --> 01:04:34,680
Do you want me to grab you
some, next time I'm in there?

1338
01:04:34,701 --> 01:04:35,711
A couple of the small packets?

1339
01:04:35,794 --> 01:04:38,836
That's the nicest offer
I've had in a long time.

1340
01:04:39,638 --> 01:04:40,711
Sure.

1341
01:04:40,732 --> 01:04:42,690
Well, you know, collecting
travel-sized condiments

1342
01:04:42,711 --> 01:04:45,659
is, like, a very big
part of my life.

1343
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:46,681
The tiny little
ketchup bottles?

1344
01:04:46,743 --> 01:04:48,848
Or the little Tabascos?
They slay me!

1345
01:04:48,868 --> 01:04:51,775
-So, as I was saying, Renee...
-Oh, yeah.

1346
01:04:51,806 --> 01:04:55,785
...has been instrumental
in helping refine our message.

1347
01:04:55,806 --> 01:04:56,868
Uh-huh.

1348
01:04:57,837 --> 01:04:59,806
And just what is that message?

1349
01:04:59,837 --> 01:05:00,868
Well...

1350
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:05,660
Just that I think that most
luxury brands get it so wrong

1351
01:05:05,681 --> 01:05:06,806
when they try to
make a diffusion line.

1352
01:05:06,868 --> 01:05:08,869
They treat it
more aspirational,

1353
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:10,640
when it really needs to be...

1354
01:05:10,713 --> 01:05:11,713
Functional.

1355
01:05:11,765 --> 01:05:13,703
And practical and real.

1356
01:05:13,724 --> 01:05:14,724
I mean, these women,

1357
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:15,869
they know who they are,
and they just...

1358
01:05:16,776 --> 01:05:17,838
They're proud
to be bargain hunters.

1359
01:05:18,651 --> 01:05:21,651
Avery's life experience
may not allow her

1360
01:05:21,838 --> 01:05:24,713
to connect with that customer.

1361
01:05:25,744 --> 01:05:27,765
Please tell me you're going to
be in Boston with us.

1362
01:05:28,652 --> 01:05:29,777
Yes, of course. She is.

1363
01:05:30,672 --> 01:05:31,672
Of course I am?

1364
01:05:31,714 --> 01:05:32,808
Yes, of course. Remember?

1365
01:05:33,683 --> 01:05:34,693
You never
mentioned that to me.

1366
01:05:34,714 --> 01:05:37,652
Yeah, we definitely had this
conversation about you...

1367
01:05:37,714 --> 01:05:38,714
Avery, we definitely didn't.
I would remember...

1368
01:05:38,745 --> 01:05:39,745
-Boston...
-That would be, like,

1369
01:05:39,766 --> 01:05:41,704
-a very big deal to me.
-Don't you remember?

1370
01:05:41,725 --> 01:05:42,725
I would have called you.

1371
01:05:42,745 --> 01:05:43,777
I would have called,
like, everybody.

1372
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:44,870
Is your eye okay?

1373
01:05:45,704 --> 01:05:48,641
Oh, my God, would you
please just agree to go?

1374
01:05:48,745 --> 01:05:49,809
Before her fake eyelashes

1375
01:05:49,830 --> 01:05:51,673
come flying off
her bulging eyes.

1376
01:05:52,778 --> 01:05:53,778
Stop that.

1377
01:05:54,746 --> 01:05:57,746
Would you come with us
to Boston

1378
01:05:57,778 --> 01:05:58,861
for the Target pitch?

1379
01:05:59,715 --> 01:06:02,653
Oh, hell yeah, Gram.
I will be in Boston!

1380
01:06:02,684 --> 01:06:03,684
Of course I'll go!

1381
01:06:03,767 --> 01:06:05,757
Does the Pope shit in Boston?
I'm going.

1382
01:06:09,809 --> 01:06:11,810
This is definitely where my
work friends said they'd be.

1383
01:06:12,685 --> 01:06:13,685
Why are we running?

1384
01:06:13,716 --> 01:06:15,654
It's like a super exclusive

1385
01:06:15,674 --> 01:06:17,654
speakeasy, with, like,
a hot crowd.

1386
01:06:22,716 --> 01:06:25,747
Hi. Um, we're here
for the speakeasy.

1387
01:06:26,779 --> 01:06:27,799
What speakeasy?

1388
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:29,831
Uh...

1389
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:32,748
Three girls for the speakeasy.

1390
01:06:33,811 --> 01:06:35,759
-No.
-Am I saying that right?

1391
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:36,780
-Speakeasy...
-It's cool. We'll find it.

1392
01:06:36,811 --> 01:06:37,873
-Thanks, dude.
-Speak...

1393
01:06:38,811 --> 01:06:39,811
He was supposed to
just show us

1394
01:06:39,832 --> 01:06:41,655
where the doorway was. Right?

1395
01:06:41,675 --> 01:06:42,873
-That's clear.
-Right.

1396
01:06:43,644 --> 01:06:44,811
I don't understand. And now,

1397
01:06:44,842 --> 01:06:46,780
look, he's leading
these girls to it.

1398
01:06:47,686 --> 01:06:48,738
Ew!
Those posers don't know

1399
01:06:48,759 --> 01:06:49,759
what they're missing out here.

1400
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:51,717
Didn't I ask you guys
to wear heels?

1401
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:53,770
Yeah, well,
I can't walk in heels.

1402
01:06:53,791 --> 01:06:54,791
-So...
-I'm just saying that

1403
01:06:54,812 --> 01:06:55,812
if we want to get
into places like this...

1404
01:06:55,843 --> 01:06:58,718
We don't really care about
getting into places like that.

1405
01:06:58,749 --> 01:06:59,833
But I guess now you do?

1406
01:07:00,687 --> 01:07:02,687
Jenn! Hi! Oh, my God!

1407
01:07:05,687 --> 01:07:07,645
-Oh! Hello.
-Hello, sir.

1408
01:07:07,801 --> 01:07:10,781
Can I get
one of all of those?

1409
01:07:10,864 --> 01:07:11,864
Thank you.

1410
01:07:12,656 --> 01:07:13,771
Okay, good news, bad news.

1411
01:07:13,865 --> 01:07:16,698
Um... Good news is
that I can get in.

1412
01:07:16,719 --> 01:07:17,844
Bad news is you guys can't.

1413
01:07:18,657 --> 01:07:19,750
So, you know, obviously

1414
01:07:19,771 --> 01:07:20,844
I'm going to stay
with you guys.

1415
01:07:20,875 --> 01:07:22,636
I want to be here

1416
01:07:22,657 --> 01:07:24,844
and not in there,
in some dumb club

1417
01:07:24,875 --> 01:07:26,709
with these girls
I barely know.

1418
01:07:26,729 --> 01:07:27,729
Yeah...

1419
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:29,750
Unless that's what you guys
think I should do 'cause...

1420
01:07:29,771 --> 01:07:31,719
-Yeah...
-Yeah? Are you sure?

1421
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:33,823
Okay. Okay, thank you so much,
you guys. Okay.

1422
01:07:33,844 --> 01:07:34,845
I will tell you guys

1423
01:07:34,876 --> 01:07:35,876
absolutely everything
tomorrow.

1424
01:07:36,647 --> 01:07:37,658
Enjoy the food.

1425
01:07:38,658 --> 01:07:39,876
Okay, is there where it is?

1426
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:42,814
-In here?
-Mmm-hmm.

1427
01:07:46,876 --> 01:07:48,689
And then what I realized

1428
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,658
is that I could eat
whatever I want,

1429
01:07:50,678 --> 01:07:51,699
and still look like this.

1430
01:07:52,803 --> 01:07:53,876
Shout out to
my genetic makeup.

1431
01:07:58,711 --> 01:07:59,721
So blessed.

1432
01:08:03,659 --> 01:08:04,804
We'll be with you momentarily.

1433
01:08:05,721 --> 01:08:07,784
Hello, Lily LeClaire,
you've got Renee.

1434
01:08:08,752 --> 01:08:09,846
-Hi.
-Hi. One second.

1435
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:11,877
Yeah. I love
hearing your voice, too.

1436
01:08:12,659 --> 01:08:13,659
I have an appointment...

1437
01:08:13,679 --> 01:08:14,679
East Coast Escrow
is on the second floor.

1438
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:15,700
You're gonna wanna
head down there.

1439
01:08:15,721 --> 01:08:16,722
I'm sorry, can you just...

1440
01:08:16,753 --> 01:08:17,753
If you could scoot
just a little bit.

1441
01:08:17,785 --> 01:08:18,826
Welcome to Lily LeClaire.

1442
01:08:18,847 --> 01:08:20,868
I am living for your bag.

1443
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:22,660
Thanks!

1444
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:35,753
Oh, my God,
you're waiting for me. Hi.

1445
01:08:35,774 --> 01:08:36,826
Hi.

1446
01:08:36,847 --> 01:08:38,848
Thank you so much
for still doing this.

1447
01:08:38,879 --> 01:08:40,733
Oh, my God, stop it.

1448
01:08:40,754 --> 01:08:42,661
I wouldn't miss
our first Grouper date.

1449
01:08:42,692 --> 01:08:44,681
I know, but you know,
Ethan and...

1450
01:08:44,713 --> 01:08:45,869
Hey, I want to do this.

1451
01:08:46,671 --> 01:08:47,671
-Okay. Yes.
-All right.

1452
01:08:47,692 --> 01:08:48,879
I'm going to be like
the ultimate wing woman.

1453
01:08:49,650 --> 01:08:50,692
And when
they pay attention to me,

1454
01:08:50,723 --> 01:08:51,744
I'll just redirect them
to you.

1455
01:08:51,765 --> 01:08:52,765
-Oh.
-That's my whole plan.

1456
01:08:52,786 --> 01:08:53,806
-Okay.
-Okay.

1457
01:08:54,744 --> 01:08:55,744
Okay.

1458
01:08:56,723 --> 01:08:57,744
There's... Okay.

1459
01:08:58,849 --> 01:09:01,797
- Hey, y'all. I am Renee.
- Hey.

1460
01:09:01,818 --> 01:09:03,880
-Hey.
-Hi. Nice to meet you.

1461
01:09:04,651 --> 01:09:05,849
-Nice to meet you.
-You guys,

1462
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:06,880
what are we talking about?

1463
01:09:07,651 --> 01:09:08,724
Renee, where are you from?

1464
01:09:08,807 --> 01:09:09,870
Oh.

1465
01:09:10,693 --> 01:09:11,849
No, I see
what's happening here.

1466
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:15,776
No, redirect that energy
all over here.

1467
01:09:15,849 --> 01:09:17,724
Not all over her face,

1468
01:09:17,787 --> 01:09:19,788
but you and I are
not going to happen.

1469
01:09:20,694 --> 01:09:21,808
Lyle, I like your scarf.

1470
01:09:22,663 --> 01:09:24,756
Oh, really, this little thing.
You don't think it's too much?

1471
01:09:24,871 --> 01:09:25,881
Is it hand-knit?

1472
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:28,840
'Cause I actually
do some loom weaving.

1473
01:09:29,683 --> 01:09:30,735
I don't know
how to make a scarf,

1474
01:09:30,756 --> 01:09:32,808
but once I made a Native
American medicine bag.

1475
01:09:32,850 --> 01:09:35,881
Actually, my sister studies
18th-century textiles online.

1476
01:09:36,652 --> 01:09:38,673
Actually,
a little bit about Viv

1477
01:09:38,694 --> 01:09:39,725
that's unexpected.

1478
01:09:39,756 --> 01:09:41,664
She was thrown
out of eighth grade

1479
01:09:41,695 --> 01:09:43,820
for showing everybody
her boobies.

1480
01:09:43,841 --> 01:09:44,851
We all have a past.

1481
01:09:44,872 --> 01:09:46,736
And look, don't sleep on Jane.

1482
01:09:46,757 --> 01:09:47,820
Yes, she's dressed
like an old man

1483
01:09:47,841 --> 01:09:49,882
watering his lawn,
it doesn't matter.

1484
01:09:50,664 --> 01:09:51,820
Because once she gets
out of these clothes,

1485
01:09:51,841 --> 01:09:53,664
she has a sick body.

1486
01:09:53,695 --> 01:09:55,684
I can tell you guys have
a lot of sexual energy.

1487
01:09:55,726 --> 01:09:56,726
You know what, I feel like
we could use

1488
01:09:56,747 --> 01:09:57,747
some more drinks.
The ladies will be right back.

1489
01:09:57,768 --> 01:09:58,768
Yeah.

1490
01:09:58,789 --> 01:10:00,664
Okay. You guys get a drink,
and I'll hang with the boys.

1491
01:10:00,695 --> 01:10:01,706
No, no. You're coming with.
Come on. No.

1492
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:02,727
Okay.

1493
01:10:02,883 --> 01:10:05,685
-Hey.
-What are you doing to us?

1494
01:10:05,883 --> 01:10:07,831
I'm trying to help you guys,
you serious?

1495
01:10:07,862 --> 01:10:08,862
What?

1496
01:10:08,883 --> 01:10:10,654
I'm setting you up
for success.

1497
01:10:10,685 --> 01:10:11,717
Just be hotter.

1498
01:10:11,852 --> 01:10:13,779
You got to lead
with your hotness.

1499
01:10:13,883 --> 01:10:16,696
And then let them find out
how boring you are later.

1500
01:10:16,821 --> 01:10:17,883
You think we're boring?

1501
01:10:18,654 --> 01:10:20,696
Let's start over, okay.

1502
01:10:20,727 --> 01:10:21,790
You guys are going to be fun.

1503
01:10:21,821 --> 01:10:22,822
Let's have a blast.

1504
01:10:23,666 --> 01:10:25,666
I'm feeling like shots.

1505
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:26,822
You guys want shots?

1506
01:10:27,666 --> 01:10:28,811
You guys are crazy.

1507
01:10:28,874 --> 01:10:31,697
Oh, hi. Hi, how are you?

1508
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:32,884
Can we have six shots
of Fireball?

1509
01:10:33,728 --> 01:10:34,759
All right.

1510
01:10:35,666 --> 01:10:37,759
Oh, my God. Obsessed with me.

1511
01:10:37,884 --> 01:10:38,884
Is he staring?

1512
01:10:39,666 --> 01:10:40,697
-No.
-Yeah.

1513
01:10:40,718 --> 01:10:42,811
We always
dance together like crazy.

1514
01:10:43,729 --> 01:10:44,729
Back it up!

1515
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:46,698
-Not to me.
-Please, don't do that to her.

1516
01:11:08,699 --> 01:11:09,699
Renee.

1517
01:11:09,845 --> 01:11:10,845
Can I sit here?

1518
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:15,730
I'm a slightly nervous flyer,
so I took a few things.

1519
01:11:15,824 --> 01:11:16,845
Oh, cool.

1520
01:11:17,824 --> 01:11:19,657
Okay, yeah.

1521
01:11:19,793 --> 01:11:20,813
This is absolutely nuts.

1522
01:11:20,834 --> 01:11:21,834
I'm bugging,

1523
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:23,668
I'm bugging right out,
right now.

1524
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:25,762
Well, if things go
like I expect they will,

1525
01:11:25,783 --> 01:11:27,825
we have a lot more trips
like this in our future.

1526
01:11:28,658 --> 01:11:30,887
What are you talking about?
Like vacays to the Maldives?

1527
01:11:31,731 --> 01:11:33,835
No, I was thinking
more like Akron

1528
01:11:33,856 --> 01:11:36,731
or Milwaukee,
where we have our factories.

1529
01:11:36,794 --> 01:11:38,794
Okay. Okay.
I thought we were going

1530
01:11:38,825 --> 01:11:40,700
a different way with it,
but cool.

1531
01:11:40,794 --> 01:11:42,783
Oh, I also want to
give you a title.

1532
01:11:43,669 --> 01:11:44,669
Something like...

1533
01:11:44,752 --> 01:11:46,826
VP of diffusion line,
if you like that?

1534
01:11:47,701 --> 01:11:50,815
Okay. I have a title?
VP of the diffusion line!

1535
01:11:51,722 --> 01:11:52,795
Wait, should I get,
like, a standing desk

1536
01:11:52,826 --> 01:11:54,680
or something?
Is that too fancy?

1537
01:11:54,701 --> 01:11:55,795
No, those people always look
like they work at Verizon,

1538
01:11:55,815 --> 01:11:56,815
but I don't know.

1539
01:11:57,701 --> 01:11:58,815
Are you sure you don't want to
sit near the snacks?

1540
01:11:58,857 --> 01:11:59,857
I don't want to hog them.

1541
01:12:00,659 --> 01:12:01,784
There's just, like, so many.

1542
01:12:02,670 --> 01:12:03,784
So, let's talk
about the keynote speech.

1543
01:12:03,815 --> 01:12:05,795
So I put the whole thing
on my tablet.

1544
01:12:05,826 --> 01:12:08,691
I can hook up to a Bluetooth,
or I can just be on a remote.

1545
01:12:08,723 --> 01:12:09,754
I can go to a flat screen...

1546
01:12:09,848 --> 01:12:10,858
Shh...

1547
01:12:12,889 --> 01:12:14,827
-Okay.
-We'll be great...

1548
01:12:14,889 --> 01:12:16,691
I'm just going to be quiet.

1549
01:12:18,796 --> 01:12:20,660
Come up there? Okay.

1550
01:12:29,724 --> 01:12:30,724
Hi.

1551
01:12:31,692 --> 01:12:32,692
She see me?

1552
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:34,661
-Avery?
-Yeah.

1553
01:12:34,828 --> 01:12:36,734
No. It's an hour flight.

1554
01:12:36,849 --> 01:12:38,651
Word will probably get out.

1555
01:12:38,672 --> 01:12:40,797
Yeah, but once we're up
in the air, it's too late.

1556
01:12:41,828 --> 01:12:42,828
I didn't know you were coming.

1557
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:43,859
Oh, yeah,
I'm just hitching a ride

1558
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:44,890
to the Yankees-Red Sox game.

1559
01:12:46,661 --> 01:12:47,672
So cool.

1560
01:12:47,786 --> 01:12:48,859
Are you pleasantly surprised?

1561
01:12:49,735 --> 01:12:50,798
-That you're coming?
-Yeah.

1562
01:12:51,735 --> 01:12:52,735
Mmm-hmm.

1563
01:12:52,766 --> 01:12:53,798
Good. Me, too.

1564
01:12:53,829 --> 01:12:54,860
<i> Good morning,</i>
<i>welcome aboard. This is Dan,</i>

1565
01:12:54,891 --> 01:12:56,704
your captain speaking.

1566
01:12:56,725 --> 01:12:57,829
About 35 minutes up to Boston,

1567
01:12:57,850 --> 01:12:58,870
skies are clear.

1568
01:12:58,891 --> 01:13:00,891
Sit back, relax
and enjoy the ride.

1569
01:13:02,704 --> 01:13:06,652
"What we really wanna say
to our customer is that, yes,

1570
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:08,715
"we have made these items

1571
01:13:08,736 --> 01:13:11,643
"cheaper for her
and easier to use.

1572
01:13:12,612 --> 01:13:13,674
"But really...

1573
01:13:15,674 --> 01:13:18,799
"But really what
we've made them is better...

1574
01:13:19,757 --> 01:13:22,737
"...is better for her.

1575
01:13:23,799 --> 01:13:28,560
"Because we love her."

1576
01:13:28,726 --> 01:13:29,778
No, thank you.

1577
01:13:31,581 --> 01:13:33,602
"Because we love her..."

1578
01:13:36,790 --> 01:13:37,790
Oh.

1579
01:13:38,561 --> 01:13:39,581
Hey.

1580
01:13:39,706 --> 01:13:40,727
Hi.

1581
01:13:41,592 --> 01:13:43,561
So, I'm...
I'm right next door.

1582
01:13:43,581 --> 01:13:45,769
That's crazy.

1583
01:13:45,790 --> 01:13:47,675
Do you mind if I come in
and make a quick phone call?

1584
01:13:49,571 --> 01:13:51,633
That okay? Great, thanks.

1585
01:13:57,634 --> 01:13:58,718
-Yeah, the phone is...
-Right here?

1586
01:13:59,593 --> 01:14:00,666
The phone... Yeah.

1587
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:05,603
Hey, yeah, can I get
the steelhead salmon?

1588
01:14:05,728 --> 01:14:07,614
And you can leave off
the gremolata,

1589
01:14:08,645 --> 01:14:10,739
and the tartlette of leek
and chanterelles.

1590
01:14:10,759 --> 01:14:12,811
-You want anything?
-Oh, no. I'm fine.

1591
01:14:13,656 --> 01:14:14,656
Mozzarella sticks?

1592
01:14:16,615 --> 01:14:18,656
-Mozzarella sticks.
-Mozzarella sticks, okay.

1593
01:14:18,677 --> 01:14:19,812
If you want them,
I don't even like them.

1594
01:14:20,583 --> 01:14:21,812
-But if you like them...
-No, I want them.

1595
01:14:22,583 --> 01:14:24,740
And a couple of orders
of mozzarella sticks.

1596
01:14:25,573 --> 01:14:26,635
Right. Thanks.

1597
01:14:28,656 --> 01:14:30,646
-Why can't you order?
-Yeah.

1598
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:32,792
So, Avery had
all the room charges

1599
01:14:32,812 --> 01:14:34,595
blocked from my room.

1600
01:14:35,730 --> 01:14:37,595
Hey, it's not funny.

1601
01:14:37,741 --> 01:14:39,626
See, if I'd known
she was going to do that,

1602
01:14:39,647 --> 01:14:42,657
I would have just
asked to room with you

1603
01:14:42,678 --> 01:14:43,688
from the beginning.

1604
01:14:44,688 --> 01:14:45,709
Huh.

1605
01:14:45,730 --> 01:14:47,647
Right.

1606
01:14:48,647 --> 01:14:51,626
This is cute. These pigtails.

1607
01:14:52,626 --> 01:14:53,626
Yeah.

1608
01:14:53,647 --> 01:14:54,741
Don't see them
so much these days.

1609
01:14:54,793 --> 01:14:57,679
Yeah, two of them.

1610
01:14:57,700 --> 01:14:59,637
Yeah, saw the other one
around there.

1611
01:14:59,658 --> 01:15:00,658
Yeah.

1612
01:15:02,585 --> 01:15:03,585
It's nice.

1613
01:15:03,689 --> 01:15:04,689
Thanks.

1614
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:07,710
So, they got you
the big suite, huh?

1615
01:15:08,814 --> 01:15:09,814
Yeah.

1616
01:15:10,585 --> 01:15:11,783
This is, like, twice the size
of my room.

1617
01:15:12,617 --> 01:15:13,773
It's bigger than my apartment.

1618
01:15:14,596 --> 01:15:15,742
God, look at the size
of this bed.

1619
01:15:15,762 --> 01:15:18,774
Oh, yeah. Oh, that's...

1620
01:15:19,670 --> 01:15:20,670
I'll just put this there.

1621
01:15:20,690 --> 01:15:21,722
...just a bandage from my leg.

1622
01:15:21,743 --> 01:15:24,638
Um...

1623
01:15:24,743 --> 01:15:27,618
I'm supposed to go
meet your sister at the bar,

1624
01:15:27,638 --> 01:15:29,586
to go over the presentation.

1625
01:15:29,774 --> 01:15:31,649
I'll just leave as soon as
the food comes, then.

1626
01:15:32,743 --> 01:15:33,743
Wow.

1627
01:15:34,711 --> 01:15:35,743
Looks like
you're totally prepared

1628
01:15:35,763 --> 01:15:36,763
for this meeting tomorrow.

1629
01:15:36,795 --> 01:15:37,796
Yeah.

1630
01:15:37,816 --> 01:15:40,681
I mean, I'm sure you'll just
dazzle them, as per usual.

1631
01:15:42,619 --> 01:15:43,639
I dazzle?

1632
01:15:43,723 --> 01:15:44,816
Please, like you don't know.

1633
01:15:46,619 --> 01:15:50,712
Come on, you dazzle my sister,
my grandma, me.

1634
01:15:51,681 --> 01:15:52,691
What?

1635
01:15:52,785 --> 01:15:53,785
Come here, sit down.

1636
01:15:57,806 --> 01:16:00,620
I don't know
how you do it, Renee.

1637
01:16:02,651 --> 01:16:04,620
But you've gotten
a whole lot of women

1638
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:06,682
who always think
they know best

1639
01:16:06,703 --> 01:16:09,776
to sit up
and take notice of you.

1640
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:15,661
And what you think,
and who you are.

1641
01:16:17,786 --> 01:16:18,786
Me?

1642
01:16:19,673 --> 01:16:22,704
Yeah, I can't even get
my room charges covered.

1643
01:16:23,808 --> 01:16:28,631
Yeah, but a lot of women
notice you, too.

1644
01:16:29,777 --> 01:16:32,766
Maybe, but that's just
'cause of my family's money.

1645
01:16:33,673 --> 01:16:34,693
Uh...

1646
01:16:34,714 --> 01:16:35,714
I think.

1647
01:16:35,818 --> 01:16:36,818
Yeah, no.

1648
01:16:37,589 --> 01:16:38,589
Maybe not?

1649
01:16:38,610 --> 01:16:39,610
No.

1650
01:16:40,705 --> 01:16:43,778
Problem is, I never
really know, you know?

1651
01:16:44,663 --> 01:16:45,736
No, I don't.

1652
01:16:46,705 --> 01:16:48,642
Except, you know, with you,

1653
01:16:49,642 --> 01:16:52,622
I feel like
I actually do know.

1654
01:16:53,767 --> 01:16:55,736
That I'm gunning
for your money?

1655
01:16:56,788 --> 01:16:58,590
Every last cent of it.

1656
01:17:08,737 --> 01:17:10,664
Oh...

1657
01:17:14,695 --> 01:17:15,727
Uh...

1658
01:17:15,748 --> 01:17:17,675
I am wet...

1659
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:18,727
Excuse me?

1660
01:17:18,779 --> 01:17:21,591
...with diarrhea.

1661
01:17:21,664 --> 01:17:23,759
-Oh.
-Yeah, I...

1662
01:17:23,811 --> 01:17:25,644
I need you to go,

1663
01:17:25,665 --> 01:17:27,780
'cause I just feel how much
I'm getting diarrhea.

1664
01:17:27,801 --> 01:17:28,811
Okay.

1665
01:17:29,582 --> 01:17:32,582
And I don't want you
to see the diarrhea.

1666
01:17:51,812 --> 01:17:53,666
Who are you?

1667
01:17:55,625 --> 01:17:56,656
Who are you?

1668
01:17:56,677 --> 01:17:57,760
Hey, Renee,
the food's here.

1669
01:17:57,781 --> 01:17:58,802
I guess I'll head off.

1670
01:18:43,627 --> 01:18:45,742
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1671
01:18:51,805 --> 01:18:53,815
Renee, whoa, are you okay?

1672
01:18:55,586 --> 01:18:56,742
Yeah, never better.

1673
01:18:56,763 --> 01:18:58,711
I'm looking
for Avery LeClaire.

1674
01:18:58,732 --> 01:19:00,700
I'm supposed to meet her down
here, but I'm really late.

1675
01:19:00,721 --> 01:19:01,721
Have you seen her?

1676
01:19:01,825 --> 01:19:03,784
You've got blood spurting out
of your head.

1677
01:19:04,659 --> 01:19:07,754
Oh, yeah, it really hurts.
What are you doing here?

1678
01:19:08,587 --> 01:19:09,639
I'm just getting ready
for the Target pitch tomorrow.

1679
01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:10,764
They want me
to do some AV stuff.

1680
01:19:10,785 --> 01:19:12,774
Wait a minute.
You recognize me?

1681
01:19:12,795 --> 01:19:13,795
Yeah.

1682
01:19:13,816 --> 01:19:15,764
You recognize me right now,
no problem?

1683
01:19:15,785 --> 01:19:17,806
Yeah, I mean, the blood
threw me a little, but...

1684
01:19:17,826 --> 01:19:19,806
Oh, my God,
I knew I felt different.

1685
01:19:19,826 --> 01:19:22,806
Oh, my God.
Please let it not be gone.

1686
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:27,786
Please, God.
Please, please, please.

1687
01:19:33,807 --> 01:19:37,671
No, no, no.

1688
01:19:38,609 --> 01:19:39,609
No!

1689
01:19:39,702 --> 01:19:41,650
It's gone! It's gone!

1690
01:19:42,692 --> 01:19:46,765
I said, "Who are you?"
into the foggy mirror,

1691
01:19:46,786 --> 01:19:48,661
and I hit my head.

1692
01:19:49,662 --> 01:19:50,787
I must've broken the spell,

1693
01:19:50,808 --> 01:19:52,683
and it's gone!

1694
01:19:55,630 --> 01:19:57,620
I knew it.
I knew it couldn't last!

1695
01:19:57,641 --> 01:20:00,766
Why would this last?
You're so stupid, Renee!

1696
01:20:01,651 --> 01:20:02,714
What's wrong with you?

1697
01:20:03,620 --> 01:20:05,662
I'm back to being me!

1698
01:20:16,798 --> 01:20:17,809
Okay.

1699
01:20:18,829 --> 01:20:21,631
I need you to give this
to Avery LeClaire.

1700
01:20:22,694 --> 01:20:24,809
It has everything she needs
for the presentation.

1701
01:20:24,829 --> 01:20:26,756
She's going to think
she can't do it, but she can.

1702
01:20:26,777 --> 01:20:27,819
Why?
Aren't you going to do it?

1703
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:30,685
I wish I could be there,
but I can't.

1704
01:20:30,705 --> 01:20:31,747
Will you tell her?

1705
01:20:31,768 --> 01:20:33,632
-Okay.
-Okay.

1706
01:20:50,799 --> 01:20:53,665
<i>Flight 1116 to New York</i>

1707
01:20:53,686 --> 01:20:56,613
is now boarding at gate C-17.

1708
01:21:32,832 --> 01:21:34,667
Oh, no.

1709
01:21:39,740 --> 01:21:41,656
<i>Renee, I did the pitch.</i>

1710
01:21:41,677 --> 01:21:42,771
I did it just like you said,

1711
01:21:42,792 --> 01:21:45,813
but coming from me,
it just didn't sound right.

1712
01:21:45,833 --> 01:21:47,813
Now we're doing
this giant launch event

1713
01:21:47,833 --> 01:21:49,708
to show everyone
how great the line is,

1714
01:21:49,729 --> 01:21:52,781
and we need you. Call me!

1715
01:21:57,772 --> 01:21:58,793
<i>- Hey, you're home!</i>

1716
01:21:58,814 --> 01:22:00,730
Oh, shit, hello?

1717
01:22:01,657 --> 01:22:03,803
Are you okay?
What just happened?

1718
01:22:03,824 --> 01:22:05,626
Um... Uh... I...

1719
01:22:05,647 --> 01:22:06,709
Oh, God.

1720
01:22:06,751 --> 01:22:09,720
My back. I broke it.

1721
01:22:09,761 --> 01:22:10,761
Just now?

1722
01:22:10,793 --> 01:22:12,626
No, no, no. Um...

1723
01:22:13,761 --> 01:22:15,669
At the airplane.

1724
01:22:15,804 --> 01:22:17,596
Well, that sucks.

1725
01:22:17,669 --> 01:22:18,752
What if I come over
and take care of you?

1726
01:22:18,804 --> 01:22:20,679
No, no, no, no.

1727
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:21,700
Okay...

1728
01:22:21,721 --> 01:22:23,773
They're spraying for ants.

1729
01:22:23,794 --> 01:22:26,596
Oh, well, then, Renee,
you shouldn't be there anyway.

1730
01:22:26,617 --> 01:22:27,617
That's horrible.

1731
01:22:27,637 --> 01:22:28,721
That's like poison stuff.
I'll come get you.

1732
01:22:28,742 --> 01:22:32,825
No, I really want to be here
for the ant removal.

1733
01:22:33,596 --> 01:22:35,690
I don't want them
to remove the ones I like.

1734
01:22:36,774 --> 01:22:38,774
And I don't really look
my best right now. So I...

1735
01:22:38,795 --> 01:22:40,659
Obviously,
I don't believe that.

1736
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:42,628
I think you look great
all the time.

1737
01:22:42,649 --> 01:22:43,649
How about this?

1738
01:22:43,670 --> 01:22:44,743
Saturday night,
I'll take you out.

1739
01:22:44,784 --> 01:22:46,753
You're probably gonna be
recovered by then, right?

1740
01:22:46,805 --> 01:22:48,649
Mmm-hmm. Yes.

1741
01:22:48,701 --> 01:22:49,701
Okay. I miss you.

1742
01:22:49,795 --> 01:22:51,618
I miss you, too.

1743
01:22:57,671 --> 01:22:59,775
Oh, it seems like
you're standing right there.

1744
01:22:59,796 --> 01:23:01,817
<i>-Is your back all right now?</i>
-No.

1745
01:23:01,837 --> 01:23:03,733
It looked like
you had gotten...

1746
01:23:03,754 --> 01:23:05,660
No, that's a coincidence
'cause I'm not up.

1747
01:23:05,681 --> 01:23:06,806
Don't rush this if you...

1748
01:23:14,785 --> 01:23:17,702
Darling, if all you have
is a pack of gum, please.

1749
01:23:18,828 --> 01:23:24,693
Wait! Why her? What about me?
I'm standing right here.

1750
01:23:24,713 --> 01:23:26,703
All I have is this cookie.

1751
01:23:26,724 --> 01:23:28,745
Is it because
she's so beautiful?

1752
01:23:29,682 --> 01:23:30,734
I didn't even see you in line.

1753
01:23:30,755 --> 01:23:31,755
Yeah, right.

1754
01:23:31,776 --> 01:23:33,807
You probably have all these
cookies at your house

1755
01:23:33,828 --> 01:23:36,672
from all the 20-year-olds
that you bang!

1756
01:23:36,693 --> 01:23:37,838
And you don't even deserve it!

1757
01:23:38,609 --> 01:23:41,683
They just want your money,
so now you know that.

1758
01:23:41,798 --> 01:23:43,610
-Hi, darling.
-Hi, honey.

1759
01:23:43,756 --> 01:23:45,673
You found the ginkgo biloba.

1760
01:23:45,746 --> 01:23:46,829
-You okay?
-Mmm-hmm.

1761
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:48,756
I would like to apologize.

1762
01:23:49,725 --> 01:23:52,808
I did not know your situation
and it's very beautiful.

1763
01:23:53,704 --> 01:23:57,641
You are two beautiful
aging white men.

1764
01:23:57,714 --> 01:23:58,714
Thank you.

1765
01:24:16,809 --> 01:24:19,726
I know, it's all gone.

1766
01:24:20,684 --> 01:24:21,841
I brought you these cookies.

1767
01:24:22,643 --> 01:24:23,810
They're covered in chocolate.

1768
01:24:24,633 --> 01:24:25,831
Okay, you're so drunk.

1769
01:24:26,654 --> 01:24:28,841
And there's a picture
of a cat on safari.

1770
01:24:29,633 --> 01:24:31,643
I know you just assume
you can just

1771
01:24:31,664 --> 01:24:32,841
drop by whenever you want

1772
01:24:33,612 --> 01:24:35,748
because your loser friends
have no plans.

1773
01:24:35,768 --> 01:24:38,789
But we're about to go
to "Escape the Room."

1774
01:24:39,664 --> 01:24:42,603
It's the Grouper guys.
Hey, Groupers!

1775
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:43,665
Don't call them that.

1776
01:24:43,686 --> 01:24:44,780
Where's your scarf at?

1777
01:24:44,801 --> 01:24:48,707
I want to go to the room
you pay to be locked in.

1778
01:24:48,811 --> 01:24:51,717
I don't really feel like
being embarrassed

1779
01:24:51,738 --> 01:24:53,686
or insulted tonight, so no.

1780
01:24:53,717 --> 01:24:54,801
You don't want to go with me

1781
01:24:54,821 --> 01:24:56,676
because I'm not
pretty anymore.

1782
01:24:56,696 --> 01:24:57,707
Look, why do you think

1783
01:24:57,728 --> 01:24:58,821
everyone cares
what you look like?

1784
01:24:59,759 --> 01:25:00,769
Like, we're your friends

1785
01:25:00,790 --> 01:25:05,833
because you were fun
and funny and kind.

1786
01:25:06,625 --> 01:25:07,770
And then I don't know
what happened.

1787
01:25:08,656 --> 01:25:09,802
I could tell you
what happened.

1788
01:25:10,739 --> 01:25:12,729
All my wildest dreams
came true,

1789
01:25:12,750 --> 01:25:14,604
and then it was gone.

1790
01:25:14,625 --> 01:25:15,833
Renee, will you just
listen to yourself?

1791
01:25:16,604 --> 01:25:18,739
Your wildest dream
is that you were beautiful?

1792
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:20,625
That is so sad!

1793
01:25:20,645 --> 01:25:21,843
Yeah, like,
we never gave a shit

1794
01:25:22,614 --> 01:25:23,656
what you looked like.

1795
01:25:23,677 --> 01:25:25,792
Guys,
I just want us to go back

1796
01:25:25,813 --> 01:25:27,730
to how we were before.

1797
01:25:27,751 --> 01:25:29,709
Can't we just do that?
Can't we just go back?

1798
01:25:30,636 --> 01:25:32,823
No. And we have to go, so...

1799
01:25:33,751 --> 01:25:35,698
All of us? We all can go?

1800
01:25:35,719 --> 01:25:36,719
No.

1801
01:25:36,740 --> 01:25:38,605
Just us and not the guys?

1802
01:25:38,626 --> 01:25:39,834
Absolutely not.

1803
01:25:40,667 --> 01:25:42,844
Okay. Okay, I understand.

1804
01:25:43,813 --> 01:25:47,793
Well, I have my cell phone on
if anybody changes their mind.

1805
01:26:28,701 --> 01:26:29,701
Whoa!

1806
01:26:35,816 --> 01:26:37,806
I'm sorry. Sorry.

1807
01:26:38,754 --> 01:26:40,639
- You okay?
- Sorry.

1808
01:26:49,630 --> 01:26:50,702
Sorry, sorry.

1809
01:26:51,650 --> 01:26:52,661
What am I even worried about?

1810
01:26:52,682 --> 01:26:53,838
There's no way he's going
to recognize me.

1811
01:27:47,632 --> 01:27:48,746
Are you here alone?

1812
01:27:50,715 --> 01:27:51,737
No.

1813
01:27:53,612 --> 01:27:54,622
Yes.

1814
01:27:54,643 --> 01:27:58,758
Technically,
but I'm meeting my boyfriend.

1815
01:27:58,789 --> 01:28:00,695
Oh, right. Okay.

1816
01:28:00,716 --> 01:28:01,789
Of course.

1817
01:28:02,778 --> 01:28:08,653
Well, how about I buy you
a drink while you wait?

1818
01:28:08,841 --> 01:28:10,705
No, I really shouldn't.

1819
01:28:12,675 --> 01:28:13,779
Well, why not?

1820
01:28:14,634 --> 01:28:16,821
Just killin' time, you're
waitin' for your boyfriend.

1821
01:28:16,842 --> 01:28:18,759
I'm waitin' for my girlfriend.

1822
01:28:19,790 --> 01:28:20,852
Your girlfriend?

1823
01:28:23,706 --> 01:28:25,717
Did you say
that she's your girlfriend?

1824
01:28:26,831 --> 01:28:28,811
I did say that.

1825
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:32,696
And I hope that's okay.

1826
01:28:32,717 --> 01:28:34,760
No, I'm sure
she, like, loves it.

1827
01:28:35,707 --> 01:28:37,614
But what...

1828
01:28:37,635 --> 01:28:38,655
What's she like?

1829
01:28:40,780 --> 01:28:42,832
Like, your girlfriend...
That's your girlfriend?

1830
01:28:43,801 --> 01:28:47,645
She is pretty amazing.

1831
01:28:48,687 --> 01:28:50,791
Funny and smart.

1832
01:28:51,822 --> 01:28:54,771
And the most beautiful girl
in the world.

1833
01:28:54,854 --> 01:28:57,677
And here I am,
"How did I get this lady?"

1834
01:28:58,677 --> 01:28:59,677
And I did.

1835
01:29:07,625 --> 01:29:08,802
I can't... Excuse me.

1836
01:29:15,741 --> 01:29:16,741
Hey.

1837
01:29:16,803 --> 01:29:20,772
Hey, I'm sorry. I'm not going
to be able to make it tonight.

1838
01:29:21,637 --> 01:29:22,647
Um...

1839
01:29:24,668 --> 01:29:25,709
I can't do this.

1840
01:29:26,657 --> 01:29:27,668
I don't know what we're doing.

1841
01:29:27,689 --> 01:29:31,626
You, me, any of it.
I can't do it. I'm sorry.

1842
01:29:31,741 --> 01:29:33,720
Okay, wait. Hold on.

1843
01:29:33,741 --> 01:29:35,689
I didn't mean
to freak you out,

1844
01:29:35,709 --> 01:29:38,627
I'm sorry. I really thought
we were just having fun.

1845
01:29:38,648 --> 01:29:41,783
No, we were having fun.
That's not it. Um...

1846
01:29:43,627 --> 01:29:44,804
Um... I...

1847
01:29:46,773 --> 01:29:48,679
I don't know
what to say to you.

1848
01:29:50,731 --> 01:29:51,742
It's over.

1849
01:29:51,763 --> 01:29:52,815
Well, look,
you don't have to... Don't.

1850
01:29:52,835 --> 01:29:54,627
Let's not do it
over the phone.

1851
01:29:54,648 --> 01:29:55,773
Wherever you are,
I'll come and meet you,

1852
01:29:55,794 --> 01:29:56,794
and let's talk.

1853
01:29:56,815 --> 01:29:58,847
No, no, no. You can't come
where I am.

1854
01:29:59,618 --> 01:30:00,639
Why?

1855
01:30:00,659 --> 01:30:02,680
You can't see me anymore.

1856
01:30:03,670 --> 01:30:05,628
I'm not who you think I am.

1857
01:30:05,649 --> 01:30:06,743
And that's it? I think I...

1858
01:30:07,701 --> 01:30:09,680
I think I deserve
better than that.

1859
01:30:09,784 --> 01:30:11,732
You deserve much better
than this.

1860
01:30:11,753 --> 01:30:13,753
You deserve much better
than me.

1861
01:30:14,805 --> 01:30:15,857
I'm sorry.

1862
01:31:13,621 --> 01:31:14,829
-Hey...
-I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1863
01:31:14,850 --> 01:31:16,808
Hi. Hi, it's me.

1864
01:31:16,829 --> 01:31:18,839
-I know, yeah.
-I really need bike 34.

1865
01:31:19,631 --> 01:31:20,683
Oh, um...

1866
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:23,757
I need to recreate the magic
of that last class.

1867
01:31:23,778 --> 01:31:26,653
Oh. We would like it
if you don't recreate that.

1868
01:31:26,674 --> 01:31:29,695
I'll be fine. I just...
I really, really need it.

1869
01:31:29,715 --> 01:31:31,632
Okay. There.

1870
01:31:31,653 --> 01:31:34,632
<i>- What's up, SoHo, you ready?</i>

1871
01:31:34,653 --> 01:31:36,695
This is your ride!
This is your time!

1872
01:31:36,757 --> 01:31:39,642
Reach inside your pelvis,
core engaged!

1873
01:31:39,663 --> 01:31:41,799
I want you to set an intention
for this ride!

1874
01:31:41,820 --> 01:31:42,831
I got one!

1875
01:31:42,852 --> 01:31:44,768
If your intention
was for change,

1876
01:31:44,789 --> 01:31:46,758
the change is already here,

1877
01:31:46,779 --> 01:31:48,664
and your miracle's
already here.

1878
01:31:48,685 --> 01:31:49,685
Yes, it is!

1879
01:31:49,706 --> 01:31:50,821
Today you're going
to see that person

1880
01:31:50,841 --> 01:31:53,643
that you've always
wanted to be!

1881
01:31:53,664 --> 01:31:56,685
Change your mind!
Change your body!

1882
01:31:56,706 --> 01:31:57,821
Change your life!

1883
01:31:58,664 --> 01:31:59,800
Are you ready?

1884
01:32:00,664 --> 01:32:01,664
Yeah!

1885
01:32:01,789 --> 01:32:03,822
Here we go!
In three, two, one! Up!

1886
01:32:30,177 --> 01:32:31,177
Oh, God.

1887
01:32:38,219 --> 01:32:40,156
- Hey.
- Oh.

1888
01:32:40,198 --> 01:32:41,229
You okay?

1889
01:32:42,146 --> 01:32:44,323
Yeah. I just, um... Sorry.

1890
01:32:45,167 --> 01:32:47,230
I'm just going through
a rough breakup, so...

1891
01:32:47,251 --> 01:32:50,313
Well, I bet guys
can be pretty mean

1892
01:32:50,334 --> 01:32:52,199
when you break up
with them, right?

1893
01:32:52,220 --> 01:32:53,324
Or when they break up with you

1894
01:32:53,345 --> 01:32:56,116
for being
a real freaking person.

1895
01:32:56,188 --> 01:32:58,220
Wait, hang on.

1896
01:32:58,345 --> 01:33:00,261
The acoustics in here
are weird.

1897
01:33:00,282 --> 01:33:02,272
It sounds like you are saying
you got dumped.

1898
01:33:03,303 --> 01:33:05,199
Someone said to you,

1899
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:07,346
"I don't want
to see you anymore.

1900
01:33:07,366 --> 01:33:10,273
"Ever again. I don't want
to have sex with you again."

1901
01:33:10,294 --> 01:33:13,158
Somebody has told you...
You got dumped?

1902
01:33:13,179 --> 01:33:15,221
-Can you stop saying "dumped."
-Of course, I'm sorry.

1903
01:33:15,241 --> 01:33:18,210
I... I just assumed

1904
01:33:18,231 --> 01:33:20,169
that you wouldn't have to
deal with stuff like that.

1905
01:33:20,189 --> 01:33:23,221
What? 'Cause of my body.
Or something like...

1906
01:33:24,189 --> 01:33:27,221
Your body, your whole head.

1907
01:33:27,242 --> 01:33:29,128
Do you have every rib
that I have?

1908
01:33:30,253 --> 01:33:32,170
Everything really
worked out for you.

1909
01:33:32,190 --> 01:33:34,305
Where even are your organs?

1910
01:33:34,326 --> 01:33:37,253
I've always dealt with being
really insecure,

1911
01:33:37,274 --> 01:33:38,315
so it's nice to hear.

1912
01:33:38,336 --> 01:33:42,180
Shut up, forever. What?

1913
01:33:42,201 --> 01:33:43,367
No, I'm serious.
Like, it's an issue.

1914
01:33:44,138 --> 01:33:45,253
I struggle with self-esteem.
So...

1915
01:33:45,274 --> 01:33:48,327
I want to punch you right
in your dumb face right now.

1916
01:33:48,348 --> 01:33:51,337
Okay, that's the kind of
comment that like... I just...

1917
01:33:52,223 --> 01:33:53,368
That's what causes
my insecurity.

1918
01:33:54,139 --> 01:33:55,275
"Dumb." It's like...
It's like a trigger word.

1919
01:33:55,296 --> 01:33:56,368
I'm sorry I said that,
it's just...

1920
01:33:57,139 --> 01:34:00,316
You getting dumped is making
me feel like I might be okay.

1921
01:34:00,368 --> 01:34:02,296
Randomly it's making me
feel better, too.

1922
01:34:04,202 --> 01:34:06,160
-Okay, that's good.
-Oh, my gosh.

1923
01:34:06,181 --> 01:34:07,181
But, um...

1924
01:34:07,202 --> 01:34:08,202
I have to actually go.

1925
01:34:08,223 --> 01:34:10,328
I have a go-see
at Lily LeClaire.

1926
01:34:10,349 --> 01:34:12,161
Lily LeClaire?

1927
01:34:12,182 --> 01:34:13,224
-Yeah.
-For what?

1928
01:34:13,244 --> 01:34:16,203
Um, like modeling
a new line, I guess.

1929
01:34:16,224 --> 01:34:17,224
The diffusion line?

1930
01:34:18,140 --> 01:34:19,224
Wait, you're going
for that? It's...

1931
01:34:19,338 --> 01:34:20,359
Yeah.

1932
01:34:21,130 --> 01:34:23,265
-Okay, bye.
-Okay, bye. Feel better.

1933
01:34:23,286 --> 01:34:25,203
-Thanks.
-That guy's a dick.

1934
01:34:25,224 --> 01:34:26,265
Yeah.

1935
01:34:36,225 --> 01:34:38,235
-Morning.
-Hi.

1936
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:39,370
It's 3:00 p.m.

1937
01:34:40,308 --> 01:34:41,308
What you got for me?

1938
01:34:41,329 --> 01:34:43,141
In terms of what?

1939
01:34:43,162 --> 01:34:44,204
Packages.

1940
01:34:45,173 --> 01:34:46,245
Some of those for me?

1941
01:34:46,266 --> 01:34:47,308
Uh... No, those are empty.

1942
01:34:47,329 --> 01:34:49,339
Can I have an ionic water?
Bottom right.

1943
01:34:52,184 --> 01:34:53,309
Thanks. Uh, you should
really serve these

1944
01:34:53,330 --> 01:34:55,194
with a straw and a napkin.

1945
01:34:55,267 --> 01:34:57,163
But I won't hold it
against you.

1946
01:34:57,184 --> 01:34:58,215
Hey, do you know
if this is something

1947
01:34:58,236 --> 01:34:59,257
to do with the diffusion line?

1948
01:34:59,278 --> 01:35:03,132
Yeah, they're casting
the face of the line.

1949
01:35:03,309 --> 01:35:05,132
God!

1950
01:35:05,153 --> 01:35:07,215
They're planning a huge party
to launch the whole thing.

1951
01:35:07,236 --> 01:35:08,236
Yeah.

1952
01:35:08,257 --> 01:35:10,226
You think it ever occurred
to them to cast someone

1953
01:35:10,246 --> 01:35:12,341
who looks like they would
actually buy the products?

1954
01:35:12,362 --> 01:35:14,185
Someone like you?

1955
01:35:17,341 --> 01:35:19,143
Yeah.

1956
01:35:19,206 --> 01:35:20,216
Yes.

1957
01:35:21,154 --> 01:35:22,289
Someone exactly like me.

1958
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:26,164
Hey, Viv. Um...

1959
01:35:26,185 --> 01:35:28,175
I've been looking everywhere
for you guys. I...

1960
01:35:29,175 --> 01:35:30,216
I just want to apologize

1961
01:35:30,237 --> 01:35:32,154
for how I behaved.
I'm so sorry.

1962
01:35:32,175 --> 01:35:34,321
I... I'm so embarrassed.

1963
01:35:34,342 --> 01:35:37,176
Please tell Jane, I...

1964
01:35:38,290 --> 01:35:40,134
Anyway, um...

1965
01:35:40,311 --> 01:35:43,228
I really want you to
meet up with me on Friday.

1966
01:35:44,290 --> 01:35:46,311
I... I need you.

1967
01:35:48,259 --> 01:35:50,207
Okay. This is Renee.

1968
01:35:50,342 --> 01:35:51,342
Okay.

1969
01:36:03,197 --> 01:36:04,291
Come on!
We're going to miss it.

1970
01:36:04,312 --> 01:36:06,239
- This is uphill!
- This is it.

1971
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:07,260
This is the door.

1972
01:36:12,166 --> 01:36:13,239
-Close it. Close it.
-I am.

1973
01:36:13,260 --> 01:36:14,374
Don't yell at me.
I'm closing it.

1974
01:36:16,219 --> 01:36:17,219
Act like
you've been here before.

1975
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:18,250
Act like you work here.

1976
01:36:19,136 --> 01:36:20,261
I can't lose my job,
all right?

1977
01:36:20,282 --> 01:36:22,146
I'll have to move back
with my aunt.

1978
01:36:22,167 --> 01:36:23,209
She calls me Meat Patty.

1979
01:36:23,230 --> 01:36:24,282
-She drinks too much.
-I know.

1980
01:36:24,303 --> 01:36:26,230
Why didn't I hear about this
when we worked together?

1981
01:36:26,250 --> 01:36:27,375
This would be fun banter.

1982
01:36:28,146 --> 01:36:29,334
-Yeah.
-Okay. Just keep it cool.

1983
01:36:47,179 --> 01:36:48,179
Good evening.

1984
01:36:50,335 --> 01:36:53,168
And thank you all for
coming tonight.

1985
01:36:53,262 --> 01:36:55,272
We're so pleased
to have you here.

1986
01:36:57,169 --> 01:36:58,336
This is an exciting evening

1987
01:36:58,357 --> 01:37:02,221
for Lily LeClaire,
for you, and for me.

1988
01:37:02,346 --> 01:37:05,273
When my grandmother
first started this company,

1989
01:37:06,315 --> 01:37:08,305
in the year 1200 AD...

1990
01:37:09,284 --> 01:37:11,180
It's a long, long time ago.

1991
01:37:13,357 --> 01:37:17,346
She had only $1,000...

1992
01:37:18,222 --> 01:37:20,201
Again, that was
a long time ago...

1993
01:37:22,306 --> 01:37:24,181
Inflation, so...

1994
01:37:24,285 --> 01:37:28,243
So that would be
different now. And...

1995
01:37:31,253 --> 01:37:32,306
That wasn't supposed
to happen.

1996
01:37:33,378 --> 01:37:35,170
What... What?

1997
01:37:35,253 --> 01:37:37,337
Could somebody...
Is there anybody here...

1998
01:37:37,358 --> 01:37:38,378
Technical support?

1999
01:37:39,150 --> 01:37:43,161
Anybody who's technical
or support?

2000
01:37:43,182 --> 01:37:45,296
Stupid bitch,
you're such a failure.

2001
01:38:16,235 --> 01:38:17,370
I thought that was
going to bust easier.

2002
01:38:19,162 --> 01:38:20,203
Um...

2003
01:38:21,225 --> 01:38:22,225
Hello.

2004
01:38:22,319 --> 01:38:24,194
My name is Renee.

2005
01:38:24,309 --> 01:38:25,319
And...

2006
01:38:26,256 --> 01:38:28,371
Some of you know me
as this woman.

2007
01:38:31,194 --> 01:38:32,204
Glamorous.

2008
01:38:33,204 --> 01:38:34,225
Flawless.

2009
01:38:34,340 --> 01:38:35,361
Perfection.

2010
01:38:36,267 --> 01:38:37,371
But that's not the real me.

2011
01:38:38,340 --> 01:38:40,319
This is the real me.

2012
01:38:42,309 --> 01:38:43,320
I don't get it.

2013
01:38:44,143 --> 01:38:47,184
I know, these women
look nothing alike.

2014
01:38:48,289 --> 01:38:49,362
But they're both me.

2015
01:38:50,247 --> 01:38:52,195
Take a second to process it.

2016
01:38:53,268 --> 01:38:56,143
But in this industry,
I only felt wanted

2017
01:38:56,299 --> 01:38:58,341
when I looked like this.

2018
01:39:01,184 --> 01:39:02,205
I think she's crazy.

2019
01:39:02,226 --> 01:39:03,290
Now when I looked...

2020
01:39:20,196 --> 01:39:21,248
There was no magic.

2021
01:39:23,175 --> 01:39:24,239
That's me.

2022
01:39:25,207 --> 01:39:27,166
That's me, they're both me.
That's me.

2023
01:39:38,364 --> 01:39:40,239
I did all this as me.

2024
01:39:49,187 --> 01:39:50,354
When we're little girls,

2025
01:39:52,167 --> 01:39:54,250
we have all the confidence
in the world.

2026
01:39:56,292 --> 01:39:58,385
We let our
bellies hang out, and...

2027
01:39:59,385 --> 01:40:02,281
And we just dance and play

2028
01:40:02,302 --> 01:40:04,177
and pick our wedgies.

2029
01:40:05,302 --> 01:40:07,282
And then these things happen
that just...

2030
01:40:07,303 --> 01:40:09,188
They make us
question ourselves.

2031
01:40:09,366 --> 01:40:12,147
Somebody says something
mean to you on the playground,

2032
01:40:12,355 --> 01:40:14,147
and then we grow up,

2033
01:40:14,168 --> 01:40:17,261
and you doubt yourself
over and over again

2034
01:40:17,282 --> 01:40:19,355
until you lose
all that confidence.

2035
01:40:19,376 --> 01:40:20,386
All that self-esteem,

2036
01:40:21,157 --> 01:40:23,241
all that faith
you started with is gone.

2037
01:40:24,334 --> 01:40:26,386
But what if we didn't
let those moments get to us?

2038
01:40:27,314 --> 01:40:29,231
What if we were
stronger than that?

2039
01:40:31,221 --> 01:40:32,283
Right?

2040
01:40:32,387 --> 01:40:34,356
What if we didn't care
about how we looked?

2041
01:40:36,169 --> 01:40:37,231
Or how we sounded?

2042
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:43,179
What if we never lost
that little-girl confidence?

2043
01:40:43,346 --> 01:40:45,189
What if when someone tells us

2044
01:40:45,210 --> 01:40:48,315
that we aren't good
or thin or pretty enough,

2045
01:40:49,274 --> 01:40:51,253
we have strength
and the wisdom

2046
01:40:53,190 --> 01:40:55,347
to say what I am is better
than all of that?

2047
01:40:57,315 --> 01:41:00,295
Because what I am is me!

2048
01:41:03,211 --> 01:41:04,284
I'm me!

2049
01:41:04,388 --> 01:41:06,232
And I'm proud to be me!

2050
01:41:07,159 --> 01:41:08,315
And if you ever get the chance

2051
01:41:08,336 --> 01:41:10,379
to hang out with me
or my friends,

2052
01:41:11,150 --> 01:41:14,191
my amazing, perfect friends...

2053
01:41:14,212 --> 01:41:16,358
Well, all I have to say to you
is you're welcome.

2054
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:21,389
Mason, hit it.

2055
01:41:24,244 --> 01:41:25,389
We are real women.

2056
01:41:27,296 --> 01:41:30,224
We are.
What a great thing to be.

2057
01:41:32,161 --> 01:41:37,182
A real, healthy, just strong,
funny, kick-ass chick!

2058
01:41:37,338 --> 01:41:40,172
This new line of products
won't change your life.

2059
01:41:40,192 --> 01:41:41,370
Only you can do that.

2060
01:41:42,328 --> 01:41:44,265
And you can do that.

2061
01:41:45,151 --> 01:41:46,213
Believe me.

2062
01:41:46,370 --> 01:41:48,338
But this line
is for every girl

2063
01:41:48,359 --> 01:41:50,370
who is ready
to believe in herself!

2064
01:41:53,214 --> 01:41:55,152
You are beautiful!

2065
01:41:55,173 --> 01:41:56,246
You are everything!

2066
01:41:56,266 --> 01:41:58,329
And you are the real face
of this line!

2067
01:41:58,350 --> 01:42:01,360
And we are all the face
of Lily LeClaire!

2068
01:42:05,381 --> 01:42:08,277
Whoo!

2069
01:42:08,298 --> 01:42:10,152
You go, Renee!

2070
01:42:10,266 --> 01:42:11,371
You picked a good one,
you know.

2071
01:42:14,163 --> 01:42:15,215
Oh, my God!

2072
01:42:21,372 --> 01:42:23,226
Well, that was super weird.

2073
01:42:24,278 --> 01:42:26,205
And also very effective.

2074
01:42:27,330 --> 01:42:28,340
Thanks.

2075
01:42:28,361 --> 01:42:31,174
Do you know we offer a mental
health program at work?

2076
01:42:31,267 --> 01:42:32,330
I still have a job?

2077
01:42:33,331 --> 01:42:34,352
Oh, my God.

2078
01:42:37,195 --> 01:42:39,320
Okay, I'm gonna go say hi
to some people.

2079
01:42:42,185 --> 01:42:45,237
Avery? They're going crazy
for all this.

2080
01:42:45,258 --> 01:42:47,300
Let's be honest. We both know.

2081
01:42:48,154 --> 01:42:49,195
That's for Renee.

2082
01:42:50,310 --> 01:42:51,320
Oh!

2083
01:42:52,175 --> 01:42:55,353
Sweetheart, Renee wouldn't
be here without you.

2084
01:42:56,384 --> 01:42:58,155
None of us would.

2085
01:42:58,374 --> 01:43:00,155
Oh, Gram.

2086
01:43:17,270 --> 01:43:18,322
<i>This is Ethan.</i>

2087
01:43:18,343 --> 01:43:20,156
Hi, it's me.

2088
01:43:20,354 --> 01:43:21,354
Renee.

2089
01:43:21,385 --> 01:43:23,343
Um, I know
you probably don't want

2090
01:43:23,364 --> 01:43:26,166
to see me right now,
but I just...

2091
01:43:26,187 --> 01:43:27,281
Just, please hear me out.

2092
01:43:28,166 --> 01:43:29,343
Okay? I... I...

2093
01:43:29,364 --> 01:43:32,239
I am so sorry for how I acted
the other night.

2094
01:43:34,177 --> 01:43:35,260
I know this

2095
01:43:35,333 --> 01:43:37,271
is hard to believe,
but it has nothing to do

2096
01:43:37,292 --> 01:43:38,313
with how I feel about you.

2097
01:43:39,209 --> 01:43:42,323
And everything to do
with my feelings about me.

2098
01:43:44,178 --> 01:43:45,178
And...

2099
01:43:46,313 --> 01:43:47,313
I, uh...

2100
01:43:48,303 --> 01:43:50,323
This is gonna sound
so crazy, but I...

2101
01:43:50,344 --> 01:43:52,271
I thought that you thought

2102
01:43:52,292 --> 01:43:54,334
that I was the most beautiful
woman in the world.

2103
01:43:54,355 --> 01:43:56,313
-Hey.
-Hey.

2104
01:43:57,335 --> 01:43:59,179
I do think
that you're the most

2105
01:43:59,199 --> 01:44:00,314
beautiful woman in the world.

2106
01:44:03,366 --> 01:44:05,179
Just let me real quick...

2107
01:44:05,199 --> 01:44:06,304
-'Cause it was killing me...
-What?

2108
01:44:06,324 --> 01:44:08,158
You were, like,
struggling with it.

2109
01:44:08,179 --> 01:44:09,293
-You could see?
-Yeah, well, I saw...

2110
01:44:09,314 --> 01:44:11,189
- That's a camera?
- Yeah.

2111
01:44:11,210 --> 01:44:12,272
You could see me
that whole time?

2112
01:44:12,293 --> 01:44:13,314
Renee...

2113
01:44:14,397 --> 01:44:16,189
I've always seen you.

2114
01:44:35,263 --> 01:44:37,159
<i>- What's up, SoHo!</i>

2115
01:44:37,242 --> 01:44:39,212
You ready to change your life?

2116
01:44:40,212 --> 01:44:41,222
Yes!

2117
01:44:41,295 --> 01:44:43,222
<i> I don't know what you</i>
<i>came in here for today,</i>

2118
01:44:43,243 --> 01:44:46,160
but the miracle
is already here!

2119
01:44:46,181 --> 01:44:49,201
You just have to open up
your heart and receive it!

2120
01:44:49,347 --> 01:44:51,191
I want you
to look into the mirror

2121
01:44:51,212 --> 01:44:53,378
and visualize the change
you came in here for.

2122
01:44:53,399 --> 01:44:55,326
Is it spiritual?

2123
01:44:55,347 --> 01:44:57,212
Is it physical?

2124
01:44:57,243 --> 01:44:58,285
Is it emotional?
