I feel like if we could get
charity SoulCycle class

you're gonna see your brand awareness

Hi, this is Harper at Moedel PR.
This would just be Instagram alone.

14
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,900
But does Dorinda do anything for you?

15
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:54,864
We really have to push it out there
that this is a vegan skin care line.

16
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:58,785
The thing that's great about your product
is that eyelashes can't be too long.

I can't promise which Jonas,
but there will be a Jonas,

18
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:05,458

No bonus Jonas for you.

First off, you're probably thinking,
"Why does she have a mask on?"

24
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,730
Well, guess what. People...

25
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,859
It's a little hard to understand you.
Could you take it down for a second?

26
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,737
Just so you know.

27
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,031
There is a stomach virus
that's going around,

28
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:41,119
and my twins
have very delicate immune systems.

29
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:44,247
So don't look at me
with your judgy little eyes and dewy skin

30
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,791
and you're like, "Sarah,
why you so weird?" I don't need it.

31
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:50,336
Okay, 'cause I don't have a gag reflex,
so if I get this bug,

32
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,421
I barf, and then I die.

33
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:54,340
Well, you have really cute kids
so I understand being protective.

34
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,341
They're literally perfect.

35
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:58,595
I made this executive decision
very early on in my marriage.

36
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,598
I was like, "Honey,
you're not really father material."

37
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,850
So he got a donor. I got a surrogate.

38
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:06,144
Anyway, long story,
we have perfect babies.

39
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,937
Oh, wow, that's amazing.

40
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,607
Okay, girl talk city
with croissants is over.

41
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,692
- Can I move on?
- Yeah.

42
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,986
Oh, thanks for the permission.

43
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:18,573
- Anyway, you've been here a little while.
- Four years.

44
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,409
Right, the reason I asked you in
is because I've decided it's time

45
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:24,305
to send you on a little business trip
since I never really send you anywhere.

46
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:27,248
- You did send me to Roanoke, Virginia.
- Yeah, I apologize.

47
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,772
We paid your hospital bill, move on.

48
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,793
- Yeah.
- Anyway, here's the thing...

49
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:34,547
Disfrutes bottled sangria is looking
to expand their brand

50
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:38,676
from Spain to the States.
So we are on the verge of closing a deal

51
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,095
to become
their representative PR firm, okay?

52
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,723
- Wow!
- I know, wow. Congratulations,

53
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,392
'cause you're going to go this weekend.
Three days, Barcelona.

54
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,269
I'm going to Spain?

55
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,396
Why do you act
like you've left your apartment?

56
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,607
This is sad.
Can I really trust you?

57
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,276
- Are you ready to go represent us there?
- Of course.

58
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,530
Okay, because they're a bunch
of really horny Spaniards

59
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,032
that like the ladies.

60
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:04,535
I thought,
"Your energy would be perfect for that."

61
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:06,955
What do you mean my energy?

62
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:11,918
You know, "your energy, your drive,
your ambition, your spunk."

63
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:16,297
- Why are you putting them in quotes?
- Because I mean "vagina, energy."

64
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,258
But I don't sleep with clients.

65
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:23,137
Congratulations! Oh, my God,
where's your millennial parade? [hums]

66
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,973
Jesus Christ, anyway...

67
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,391
Have fun in Barcelona, bye.

68
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,270
Bye.

69
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,288
Just hear me out on this, okay,
we take your biz-class tick,

70
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:52,292
switch it to three coach, split the diff,
crash at your hotel

71
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:56,546
and you get to be in Spain
with the two of us, the way God intended.

72
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,172
- Amazing.
- No.

73
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:01,634
This is literally the first five minutes
of every Locked Up Abroad.

74
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:04,804
Yes, this is a perfect plan.
This is so great,

75
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,223
and I can totally take the time off
of work.

76
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:10,068
I mean, the other dentist at my practice
will just cover my patients.

77
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,730
- We have such a nice understanding
- Because you're blackmailing him.

78
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,482
What? No.

79
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:19,235
That's a no. I'm not blackmailing him.
I already told you,

80
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,572
I just happened to walk into the office
one night when he was huffing nitrous

81
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,241
with our dental assistant Dale,
and I was just like,

82
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,036
"Let me do what I need to do,

83
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,246
and I won't tell your wife and kids
about this."

84
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,081
Blackmail is like...

85
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,584
"Give me back my son!"

86
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:38,212
- That's kidnapping.
- That's full-on kidnapping.

87
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:41,924
You're like, "I know something about you.
Do what I want or I'll reveal it."

88
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,595
- That's blackmail.
- No, blackmail is like selling drugs,

89
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:49,640
but you're, like, covering it up
by having a laundromat,

90
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,952
and you're taking money
for the laundromat, but you're actually

91
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,895
putting it into this drug deal,
and you're like,

92
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:58,316
"Meet me at the corner of this and this
and if they won't, somebody dies."

93
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,679
Okay, that's a bunch of different crimes,
but what you're doing is still blackmail.

94
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,530
Oh, I am. I'm blackmailing him.

95
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,866
Hmm. I guess I'm a blackmailer. [laughs]

96
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,168
Anyways, the point is
I can get the time off.

97
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,662
And I'm freelance so I'm totes avail.

98
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,999
Sorry, ladies, this is a work trip.
It's not a vacation.

99
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,336
- You're not coming.
- No, because I heard this thing

100
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,546
- on Politico.
- Yeah, what did you hear?

101
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,800
And they were like, Harper, Nikki and Leah
are going to Spain and I was like,

102
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,928
- "This is on Politico?"
- Oh, my God, then it must be true!

103
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:30,098
- I read that I'm going to Spain.
- Oh, where did you read that?

104
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,974
Some dumb idiot's diary?

105
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:36,187
Guys, I don't come to your work
and try and steal nitrous from you

106
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,482
- and clean people's teeth.
- You are welcome to anytime.

107
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,735
This is an important work trip for me.
I could get, like, a promotion.

108
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,321
Spain, just, like, let it wash over you.

109
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,489
No.

110
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,659
[both] Yes!

111
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:50,576
No.

112
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,245
- Yes.
- No!

113
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,328
Yes!

114
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,581
I'm just gonna buy two tickets,
and we are gonna come.

115
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:59,335
[both] Yeah!

116
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,013
[all] Mmm!

117
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,589
Okay, guys,
we have to power through this jet lag

118
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:48,009
and go straight to the beach.
Come on, look at this view.

119
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,945
I wouldn't lie down on that blanket
if I were you.

120
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:53,848
Hotel rooms are black light nightmares.
There's, like, residual jizz everywhere.

121
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:56,976
Where isn't the residual jizz,
you know what I mean?

122
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,312
All right, time to get ready
for my first meeting.

123
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,104
- Good luck, Boo.
- Bye.

124
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,151
Excuse me. Where did you get weed?

125
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,111
From the cab driver, duh!

126
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,155
[Harper] You got weed from the cabbie?

127
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,824
Yeah. ♪ We're in Barcelona ♪

128
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,910
You did a drug deal,
and we didn't even notice?

129
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,662
I work quick, girl,
but you know what I'm most excited about?

130
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:17,663
[shrugs]

131
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,124
Seeing all that old man sausage
in Speedos.

132
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,335
Specifically the old man?

133
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,462
- It's vintage.
- [Harper] Ew!

134
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:27,715
I'm like Lewis and Clark,
just forge ahead, baby.

135
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,300
Show me that dick.

136
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:30,885
You know what I'm excited for?

137
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:34,263
That we're in a hotel room
and we can do whatever the heck we want.

138
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,350
- [shouts, gasps]
- [Harper] What was that?

139
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,686
- [Leah] Oh, shit. Nikki. Oh, my God.
- Nikki, are you okay?

140
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,271
I'm fine.

141
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,649
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I didn't know it was two beds.

142
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,067
You want a smoke?

143
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,237
- This is a cool trip.
- [Harper] Are you okay?

144
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,074
- Yeah, how's you guys? I'm having fun.
- All right...

145
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,159
[Leah] I thought you were dead.

146
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,538
Ladies, I will text you after.
Be safe, okay?

147
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,706
Your wish is our command.

148
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:04,210
- [Leah] Yes, honey.
- Bye, love you both!

149
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,063
- [Nikki] Love you!
- [Leah] Come on, let's smoke.

150
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,798
I'm not gonna smoke with you.

151
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,811
Remember the last time I got high
with you?

152
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,302
I embarrassed you
in front of all your drug friends.

153
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,806
Remember? And then I tried
to convince everybody that Shallow Hal

154
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:21,310
- is the best film of our generation?
- People who smoke aren't drug friends.

155
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,895
They're just friends.

156
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:26,440
Yours are drug friends.
You know, they're always just like,

157
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:30,987
"Look at this dank strain of legalize.

158
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:35,116
Oh, what's this flavor?
It's Apple Blossom. This is so good.

159
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,951
I love this strain of dank."

160
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:40,288
- Who are these people?
- That's how your drug friends talk.

161
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,848
- They never say "dank."
- Yeah, they do.

162
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:44,542
- All right, enough of the sass.
- Okay.

163
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,793
One puff.

164
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,213
One puff for the old Nickster.

165
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,548
Nasty Nikki.

166
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,843
[coughs]

167
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:57,096
Okay,
I've got this black light app downloaded.

168
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,056
Let's test this jizz theory.

169
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,936
- What the fuck?
- Oh, my God!

170
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:06,480
[screaming]

171
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:10,109
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

172
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,611
It's everywhere!

173
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:15,114
How did it get up there?

174
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,907
- Nikki!
- Everywhere!

175
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,243
Do they just jerk off wherever they want?

176
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:23,331
Who are they? Who are you?!
[screams]

177
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,847
So many different types
of boobs and nips.

178
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,433
They're like baggy fingerprints.

179
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,685
Bilbo Baggins...

180
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,562
Little Bo Peeps...

181
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:51,484
Honeydews, Rhi Rhis, Daniel Craigs.

182
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:54,487
- They're all just so beautiful, you know?
- [cellphone vibrates]

183
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,493
- Yo.
- [Harper] I'm at the beach. Where are you?

184
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:04,997
- Hi, Khaleesi.
- Hello, hello, hello.

185
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,833
- Hey, girl.
- This is Diego. He works for Disfrute,

186
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,711
and he's so nice that I just told him
that you guys tagged along.

187
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,381
Wow, you're cute.

188
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,091
Oh, thank you very much. [laughs]

189
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,510
- What?
- [Harper] Oh, no.

190
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:20,262
- Whoa.
- Were you wearing sunscreen?

191
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,723
- What am I, burned?
- You're a little red.

192
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,308
No, let's not lie, you're a lot red.

193
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:27,353
- [Leah] Red lobster baby.
- [Nikki] Oh, my God.

194
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:30,272
Am I gonna get sun poisoning?

195
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:34,110
The Spanish sun is so strong,
but don't worry, it will fade

196
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:38,030
by this evening,
and you will still look beautiful.

197
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,365
Oh.

198
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:42,868
Just get yourself,
dip a washcloth with milk,

199
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:46,038
dripping it on your supple body.

200
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,708
- Thank you...
- Diego.

201
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:52,336
- I am Nikki-ah.
- Nice to meet you, Nikki-ah.

202
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,755
Nice to meet you, too-ah.

203
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,215
[Diego laughs]

204
00:11:56,298 --> 00:12:00,302
Might I say that you are sunburned
like a lady of Swedish royalty.

205
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,305
Might I say, I am a Jewish person.

206
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,807
The chosen people.

207
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,727
- We are the chosen people.
- Sure.

208
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:12,022
I'm so sorry I have to leave.
I have my daily workout.

209
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,442
[laughing]

210
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:18,821
Why don't we meet tonight at the club?
What do you think?

211
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,704
Oh, yes, I would go to the club.
Ladies, do you want to go to the club?

212
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,701
- Sure.
- I'd go to the club.

213
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:27,246
I love clubbing and drinks
and the music that they play.

214
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:33,377
Well, we'll have dancing, drinking
and hopefully, something else.

215
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,172
Like making out and doing it.

216
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,259
I would love that inside of my heart.

217
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:41,844
- See you later.
- Okay.

218
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,764
- Preciosa.
- [speaks gibberish]

219
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,600
- [Nikki] Cuidado.
- [Diego] I will.

220
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:48,785
[Nikki] See you at the club.

221
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:52,229
Flood your basement, he wants you.

222
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:55,900
Call FEMA. It's an emergency.

223
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,902
All right,
well, let's get ready for the clubs.

224
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:01,739
- It's two p.m. We've got hours.
- [Leah] Yeah.

225
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,544
I want you guys
to be excited for the club.

226
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:06,118
- I'm so excited for the club.
- Yeah, the club!

227
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,536
The club!

228
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,131
[man] Pick a side. Let's go!

229

[dance music playing]

[man] This is how it goes.

231
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,350
[Harper] Three cute ladies coming through!

232
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,852
Sorry, okay, excuse us.

233
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,480
You gotta move. You gotta move.
You gotta move.

234
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:38,025
- We're three friends. We have to drink.
- Girls night.

235
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:43,823
Excuse me, sir.
Can we get three shots of tequilas?

[Harper] Sarah's calling me right now!

238
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:51,831
No, do not answer. You're in Barcelona.
You could be sleeping.

239
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:55,835
Yes, actually you really do,
you need your sleep, so...

he wants me to go up on the stage.

Hi, the DJ said that he wanted me
to come backstage. So...

274
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,674
- Hello.
- Hi, you know what? You're pretty,

275
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:10,177
but you're really mean,
and that's gonna serve you well in life.

276
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,013
- She's good.
- Oh, I'm good. I'm good. I'm good.

- Hi. I'm Leo, nice to meet you.
- I'm Harper, nice to meet you.

278
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:25,025
I must say, you're very talented.
I really enjoyed your music.

279
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,151
I really enjoyed it.

I've not started yet.

281
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,197
- What?
- But I'll tell the other DJ

282
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,408
how much you enjoyed her music.

283
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,244
Oh, that girl.
You seem much more talented.

00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,621
- I do?
- Yeah, like a refinement to you.

285
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:41,667
- You can tell that from me now?
- You've got more of a...

286
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,869
What I meant to say was
you're probably better than her.

287
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,132
- Thanks for that.
- Yeah. Or who knows.

288
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:52,052
Maybe you're a sociopath
or a garden variety d-bag for all I know.

289
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:56,140
Okay, or I could just be a nice guy
that wanted to tell you something.

290
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:58,726
- What did you want to tell me?
- Don't freak out about it.

291
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,813
Do you mind if I just do that?

292
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:07,067
I just wanted to show you that you've got
a massive dick on your face.

293
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,778
- What do you mean?
- You've got a massive dick on your face.

294
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,364
Oh, my God.
I have a fucking dick on my face!

What the fuck?!

297
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,764
You didn't know
you had a dick on your face,

298
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:22,166
and I wanted to help you
and take it off,

299
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:25,502
- which is what I'm going to do right now.
- Well, thank you, I guess,

300
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:29,006
so you're preserving the teaspoon
of dignity that I have left.

301
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,925
- You are very, very welcome.
- I mean, what's the point?

302
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:35,971
Everyone already saw
my big glowing dick face.

303
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,474
You know, I think it's a dying art form,
the old cock face.

304
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:42,186
You do? Well, in that case you should know
that that was nothing for me.

305
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,353
That was like a six.

306
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:46,440
- All right, steady on.
- The balls on the last one

307
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,442
would have really knocked your socks off.

308

Not a real one. Like a...

Are you staying out for one?

311
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:08,629
- I mean, maybe, it depends.
- Depends if the music's good or not?

312
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:13,759
It's probably gonna be shit, right?
I don't like EMD music.

In case the music isn't that bad
and you do stay 'round,

Oh.

And if not, I have a picture of you
with a dick on your face,

317
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:34,863
and that's photo blackmail,
so you have to see me again to delete it.

Right, well, break a leg.
Do you say that for DJs?

You can say whatever you fucking like.

All right, have a great fucking set, man.

We're VIP's now baby. Hi!

Oh, hi! Harper, we're dancing on the table
and stuff. I totally get it now.

gonna hurt myself,

- Wait, why are we at this table?

- Oh, and I'm Harper.
- Nice to meet you.

00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,454
- You, too.
- Okay, thank you, sir.

00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,374
- So what happened?
- It was amazing!

339
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:36,044
We totally had a moment,
although our moment did happen

340
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,714
because I had a giant glowing dick
on my face, so that was...

341
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,173
Wait, what?

342
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:43,969
Some dude was like,
"Whoa, I show you love,"

343
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:46,555
and he drew a dick on my face.

Listen,
the DJ is a very good friend of mine.

- Really?
- Yes, come to my house.

00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:55,355
- He will be there.
- I'm just like...

347
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:59,943
I haven't really slept with anyone
in a while, so I'm a little nervous.

You don't tell him that.
That's an over share.

00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:05,574
- I have a really difficult boss.
- Also an over share.

350

Stop telling him personal things.

00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,828

about myself lately.

- Can we go?

We just have to wait for Diego
to get here first.

354
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:18,587
Oh, he texted me. He said, he doesn't know
when he's gonna get here.

355
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:23,508
He's very sorry,
especially to his mermaid siren Nikita.

- Okay, I guess I'm a mermaid siren.

Just tell him to go to Hernando's,
then we can hook up there. Huh!

one of us is gonna sleep with him,

What if he's in the club looking for me?

387

I should let him know that I'm here,

It's a regulated drug.

they're regulating your access to it.

They're trying
to regulate people's consumption of it,

- not just the age of the people taking it.
- That is not what that means.

what that means.

00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,770
Oh, hi.

456
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,819
You look great. You look great.

457
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:26,745
Hmm.

458
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,225
Are you enjoying the party?

459
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:33,545
Oh. Yeah, yeah, it's nuts.

460
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:37,882
Did you try the drugs
or the open sexual practices

461
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,801
or maybe just a swim?

462
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:44,848
I had the sushi,
which I kind of feel covers all three.

463
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:46,766
You're funny.

464
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:50,478
- Does that work for you?
- Not really, no.

465
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,562
Oh.

466
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,106
[clears throat]

467
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:58,611
So, do you know if
Leo West is gonna show?

468
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:04,534
Harper, you have to work as hard
to find yourself as you work to find him.

469
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:09,330
Now, join me in the den
for a spiritual connection.

470
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,165
Cool.

471
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,965
[exhales]

472
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,468
- What?
- Your beauty makes me crazy.

473
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:26,097
Crazy, like I murder people with a knife.

474
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,891
You're so beautiful in the face.

475
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:30,727
I'm gonna ignore it.
I'm gonna ignore it.

476
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:35,231
Hey, Diego, I know it's late,
but I just thought, "Why not, right?"

477
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:39,861
Let's just hang, you know,
of course assuming that you are awake.

478
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:43,072
Which you may very well be asleep
and if so, I'm sorry that I woke you up.

479
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,950
Actually, that doesn't make sense
you should be here, right?

480
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:49,249
Sorry, I know that it's a voice mail,
and you can't answer me right now.

481
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:53,958
Whoa! It's 4:30 in the morning, hon.

482
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,085
Well, I am on a lot of drugs
and alcohol right now,

483
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,004
so that does explain some of it.

484
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:02,217
By the way, this is Nikki.
I don't know if I said that to you yet.

485
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:06,721
Nikki is Harper's friends,
so you know Harpers from works.

486
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:09,015
I think...

487
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:12,185
I think there are some feelings, okay,

488
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:14,896
and not quite kosher.

489
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,649
Sorry you probably don't even know
what kosher means.

490
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:23,196
Well, I'm gonna teach you. Don't worry,
I'm not going to, like, circumcise you.

491
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,991
What? No, but honestly, I love to flirt.

492
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:31,204
Thank you so much, and I look forward
to speaking with you. Bye-bye.

493
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:36,626
Okay, wow,
you're fucking nailing him, bitch.

494
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:40,421
Whoo! Good job!
I'm gonna see how fast I can go.

495
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,549
Take this, you little machine.

496
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,308
[laughing]

497
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,407
- [woman shouting in Spanish]
- What?

498
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:11,244
- Oh, shit! Okay, okay, okay, okay.
- Run!

499
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:13,580
[shouting in Spanish]

500
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:23,214
I'm going to fucking die tonight,
in some stranger's fucking shitty boxers.

501
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,050
To the left, to the left, there you go.

502
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,094
Puta!

503
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:32,015
Hey, Harp, we have to get out of here now.
Some shit went down

504
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:35,810
and it's mostly my fault, but you know,
life, we got to get the fuck out of here.

505
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,313
- No, let's stay.
- Harper, listen to me!

506
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:42,025
Someone's gonna come in here
and fuck us up with a goddamn knife.

507
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:45,445
- On my back!
- I smoked hash, and it was really nice,

508
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:47,447
- and Nikki took some hash.
- Great story.

509
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,867
So it was really fun and okay.

510
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:54,037
- Listen to me, don't move, okay?
- Okay.

511
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,331
That was fun.

512
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,001
How many languages
does your boyfriend talk?

513
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:03,630
My boyfriend talks more than one,
at least.

514
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,298
English and Spanish...

515
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,469
- Dude, Nikki, wake up, we gotta go now!
- What's happening?

516
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:12,472
This married guy ate me out,
and his wife caught us. We got to go.

517
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:15,475
- We're gonna get stabbed.
- Whoa, I burnt 4,000 calories!

518
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:18,853
- I don't care. Grab your shit, let's go!
- Do you have a coin?

519
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:22,482
- Harper! Go, go, go!
- I really wanted Leo to see me right now

520
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,234
'cause I'm really cool and sexy,
and I think he would be in to me.

521
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:26,527
[shouts]

522
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:31,074
[shouting]

523
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:35,203
[shouts in Spanish]

524
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,973
[laughing]

525
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:58,851
[Leah] Gracias, thank you so much.
Oh, gosh.

526
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,437
- [Nikki sighs]
- [Leah] We did it, ladies.

527
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:06,943
Deal with that in a second.

528
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:10,738
What are you looking at? Oh, the light.
Yeah, there's more light this way.

529
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,616
Towards our hotel, okay.

530
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:16,494
No, no, no, no time for stetchies.

531
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:20,957
- No, I have to be even.
- I understand, but I'm tired.

532
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:26,504
Let's go, get some sleep
and rest our weary heads.

533
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:30,216
- I gotta shit. I gotta shit.
- No, no, no!

534
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:33,636
- I'm not strong.
- There we go. There we go.

535
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,556
- Just hold it, just hold it.
- I've got to push it back in.

536
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,600
Nikki, honey. How are you doing?

537
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:42,061
- I'm good, how are you?
- Good.

538
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:45,398
- Want to get on my other side?
- Oh, I'm so hungry.

539
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:49,944
- Are you guys hungry?
- Yes. No, no, no. Okay, okay.

540
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:55,575
Hey, dudes. Do y'all know
where's a good pizza joint around here?

541
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:59,537
- Pizza?
- [Leah] No, you guys are beautiful.

542
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,873
Do you have the menu for room service?

543
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:04,083
They don't.
They're not in our hotel. We're outside.

544
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:07,378
- [Harper] Those look good, empanadas.
- [both] Yeah.

545
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:12,008
"Sí, y helado de chocolate."

546
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:15,762
Then just a big pile of corn on a plate
with a little bit of ranch on top.

547
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:19,390
- Yeah, a lot of bit of ranch.
- And then, all these muffins.

548
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,017
- With a side of ranch.
- Yeah.

549
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,146
I can't believe we left the club.

550
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:28,649
If we'd stayed,
I would be with him right now.

551
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,277
We had, like, a real connection.

552
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,905
You guys didn't see it. There were sparks.

553
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,657
I have to work anyway.

554
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:40,078
- My boss keeps texting me.
- Can I see your phone?

555
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:43,956
Yes, I got, like, ten text messages
and four voice mails.

556
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:48,127
You guys, I'm so hungry, I feel like
there's a monster inside of me.

557
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:51,714
And she's like,
"Give me all the foods and snacks

558
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:54,634
and also don't forget the desserts, okay?"

559
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,345
Check this out, bitch!

560
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:02,809
You're man Leo West is in Ibiza tonight.
This is fucking fate.

561
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:05,603
- Yes, yes, yes!
- Okay, stop that. Please stop.

562
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:08,564
I can't just fly to Ibiza,
I mean that's crazy.

563
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,817
Why? It's, like, so close.

564
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:15,196
Because I have a very important meeting
here tomorrow night, and if I miss it,

565
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:18,074
- I'm gonna get fired.
- Okay, here's the T.

566
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:23,079
Some people land on the moon.
Others cure diseases.

567
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:27,083
You smash this DJ.

568
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,921
Yeah, actually that was really impressive
and a good point.

569
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:35,508
No, I gotta stay here
and keep my job.

570
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:37,635
Harper, what do you want to do?

571
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,392
I want to go to Ibiza.

572
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:47,311
- Then we're going to Ibiza.
- But I can't go to Ibiza.

573
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:51,190
Yes, you can. This is destiny.
We're going to Ibiza.

574
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,359
You know what happens when destiny calls.

575
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:58,114
- You accept.
- In the words of Destiny's Child...

576
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,908
- Say my name.
- [laughing]

577
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:04,287
- Guys, he's so hot.
- He's so hot!

578
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,664
- I can't go!
- You don't have to make the decision

579
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:07,999
'cause we're gonna force you.

580
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:14,881
[both] Harper!

581
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:18,509
[men] Harper!

582
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,470
[chanting] Harper! Harper! Harper!

583
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:26,267
Harper! Harper! Harper! Harper!

584
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,768
Yay!

585
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:31,189
Guys, this is our bestest friend Harper.

586
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:34,275
- [man] Hi, Harper.
- [Leah] And we are going to Ibiza.

587
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:37,570
So we can track down this DJ
that she's gonna get dirty,

588
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:41,824
- nasty, sexy with.
- [cheering]

589
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:44,952
You're a dirty little minx,
just like your friend Leah.

590
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:47,788
Well, trying it out.
It's a new look for me.

591
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:48,956
It's bloody brilliant.

592
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,710
My grandfather always said,
"Youth is wasted on the young."

593
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:53,961
You, my new friend,

594
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:57,423
- are not wasting it.
- Yeah, actually, I once went to Norway

595
00:36:57,506 --> 00:37:00,968
to follow a girl I was in love with.
Turned out she was stealing my identity.

596
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,262
- Tried to kill him.
- She did try to kill me.

597
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:07,183
I got a dynamite anecdote out of that one.
So this could really bear fruit.

598
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:08,184
Yeah, okay.

599
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:12,897
I'm the shot police. It's against the law
to be in this area without a shot.

600
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,691
- [Harper] All right.
- [cheering]

601
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,756
- [man] I like this girl, she's cool.
- [Leah] That's my girl.

602
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,699
Don't worry, you're gonna be riding
that DJ's filthy dick in no time.

603
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:26,077
Oh, boy, I hope it's not too filthy.

604
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,705
Well, he's a professional musician,
so it's probably hanging by a thread.

605
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,751
This is all theoretical.
I probably won't find him.

606
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,254
We'll never have sex.
He doesn't have any interest in me.

607
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,547
- We just met once.
- Of course he does.

608
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:41,342
You've gotta trust these guys.
They're soccer players.

609
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:46,806
Well, not soccer, football.
Football is soccer, in England.

610
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,449
- Everywhere.
- Well, it's just for fun.

611
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:52,645
- We're not, like, professional...
- We're actually male model scientists.

612
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:54,063
- Oh.
- [man] Professionally.

613
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:57,817
Well, I'm a lawyer,
actually professionally, for real.

614
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,819
- In true life.
- Cool.

615
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:01,505
James, stop telling the truth.
What's wrong with you?

616
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:05,491
'Cause we don't want to start off
a new relationship on a lie.

617
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:07,743
- Relationship?
- Yeah, well, not like,

618
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:10,746
we're gonna hold hands
and go to the cinema,

619
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,666
but more of a relationship with you
and that lady over there.

620
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,501
Or any inanimate object.

621
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:18,045
Yeah, like a bloody belt.

622
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,715
We have much more of a relationship
than you have with a belt.

623
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,838
Yes, although,
that has been wrapped round my waist.

624
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:25,195
- [man] That's a bit aggressive.
- No, too far. Okay, great. Well...

625
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:29,557
- Guys, Ibiza!
- [all] Ibiza!

00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,560

We're in fucking Ibiza, man!

648
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,807
[laughing]

649
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:56,435
I have to say to say,
if this is as good as this trip gets,

650
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,562
- this is pretty good.
- [Nikki] Yeah.

651
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:04,235
And none of us are taking photos,
we're so in the moment.

652
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:06,320
[laughing]

653
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,172
You guys, it's been, like, over an hour.

654
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:29,051
Hola, yes, yes, yes.
Yo necesito una taxi.

655
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:34,140
Mi y mis hermanas estamos el norte playa,
Puesta del Sol.

656
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:36,975
Hola.

657
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:40,146
- Hola!
- Okay.

658
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:42,231
What the fuck? They hung up again!

659
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:45,401
So we're just stuck here
in the middle of nowhere.

660
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:48,988
I have to call Cruela DeCunt soon.
You know how bad I am at lying.

661
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:51,407
And then what happens
if we actually do get to Flow?

662
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,968
Have you thought about
how we're gonna get in?

663
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:56,620
Don't we have to be like hot or rich
or bribe the door guy?

664
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,706
- A cab, a cab!
- Oh, fuck, a cab!

665
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:03,043
Oh, God! Oh, God, hello!
Hello. Sorry to interrupt, sir.

666
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:06,172
Could you please, please,
like pretty please, we'll pay you extra,

667
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:09,758
drive us to the other side of the island
to Flow? It's a really big club.

668
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:13,929
Of course I can take you, come on.
Por favor, jump in.

669
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:18,392
[laughs] Okay, you're all in?
Welcome to my taxi!

670
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,603
- Yes!
- Name is Lazer.

671
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:22,229
Lazer!

672
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:25,357
Encantado, to Flow. To Flow, we go.

673
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:29,862
- [chattering]
- [cheering]

674
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:49,006
- Hey, Lazer, where are we?
- We're almost at my house.

675
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:53,677
What? No, you've got to take us to town
so we can go to Flow.

676
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,513
I'm just gonna feed my dog first.

677
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:59,266
- Then I'll take you into town, okay?
- That sounds sketchy as fuck.

678
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:05,231
Hey, you guys,
I'm trained in self-defense, just in case.

679
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:09,443
I can kill a man, like this.

680
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:14,031
- [shouts]
- Bless you.

681
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,201
[acoustic guitar playing]

682
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,800
[singing in Spanish]

683
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,570
Wow.

684
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:57,074
A masterpiece.
That was great. That was great.

685
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:59,077
- [Lazer] Thank you.
- Maybe we should get going?

686
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:01,453
Tengo el bebido perfecto
para esta situación.

687
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:02,621
Be right back.

688
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:06,750
If this was New York and someone was like
"Before I take you to West Ville,

689
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,594
I'm going to drive you
to my house in Yonkers

690
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:10,897
and then go all the way downtown,"
you'd be like, "What the fuck?!"

691
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:13,465
Yeah, but everybody
in New York is like... [snarls]

692
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:17,011
Whereas everybody in Ibiza is, like, cool.

693
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,930
Yeah, girl,
this place is built on rose quartz.

694
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:23,392
- So just enjoy the chill energy,
- Yes.

695
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:26,395
have fun, forget plans.

696
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:29,064
[laughs] Ahora sí.

697
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,026
So, you want to go to Flow?

698
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:35,446
I can drive you there,
but you won't get in.

699
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:40,909
However, I'll take you to my niece.
She's a dancer there, so I'll call her,

700
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,113
and she'll take care of you.

701
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:44,038
For real, your niece can get us in?

702
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:47,458
You know what else?
I have the limo I drive on weekends.

703
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:51,462
I'll take you in that
for a special treat. Okay.

704
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:54,381
You see, Ibiza loves you.
Come on, cheer up! Cheer up!

705
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,585
Raise your glasses! [laughs]

706
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:59,553
[shouting]

707
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:15,277
[all] Hi!

708
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:17,237
Can you open the moon roof?

709
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:18,947
Los pájaros al tiene visa.

710
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:21,033
I'm doing it!

711
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:24,453
[shouts]

712
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:28,874
I am a total cliche right now,
and I don't fucking care!

713
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,251
All right, why not?

714
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:34,213
[shouting]

715
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:37,966
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

716
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,678
- Shit, you guys,
- What?

717
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:44,431
A bird just shit in my mouth.

718
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:45,766
It's in my mouth.

719
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,685
- [gags]
- It's in my fucking mouth.

720
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:52,564
Oh, my God! Shit! Oh, my God!
Lazer, can I have a towel?

721
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:55,651
- Yeah, of course.
- [gagging]

722
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:56,819
It's in my mouth!

723
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:58,237
Dab, dab, dab.

724
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,907
- [shouting]
- I'm gonna throw up!

725
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:11,959
[line ringing]

726
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:18,006
- Harper?
- Hi there, Sarah. How are you?

727
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,884
It has been over 24 hours
since you've checked in.

728
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:24,012
- Where the fuck are you?
- I'm actually leaving a meeting.

729
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:28,267
- I've been looking for new clients and...
- You're fucking lying to me.

730
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:31,854
You do me a favor, you take those
goddamn cocks out of your ear

731
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:34,249
and stick them back in your mouth,
so you can listen to what I'm saying,

732
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:37,234
'cause I got some shit I gotta throw
at your face right fucking now.

733
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:39,653
This little dinner meeting tomorrow,

734
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:43,615
- it is a breakfast meeting, okay? 11 a.m.
- Tomorrow morning?

735
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:46,994
Yeah, so take a tub of concealer
and shove it under you eyes

736
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:49,830
and take a package of douche
and shove it up your twat

737
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:53,125
because you need to go there looking
and smelling fresh. You got it?

738
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:55,669
You know, I think
probably a dinner meeting is better.

739
00:45:55,753 --> 00:46:00,090
I'm really trying to set the scene
with this pitch and I... [stammers]

740
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:03,385
It hinges on an evening atmosphere.
It's gotta be at night.

741
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:07,681
Listen, you little fucking hipster Barbie.
You need to close this deal.

742
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,391
This is a huge get for this company.

743
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:12,227
It's a good thing I have a really amazing
international plan,

744
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:14,313
or I would just be so mad
at you right now.

745
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:17,333
I don't want to hear anymore from you,
because I'd have to be like, "Oh, cool."

746
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:18,734
And I don't care.

747
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:23,489
Yes, I completely understand
what you are saying.

748
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:27,868
I am just assuring you that I have this
and that the client seemed to love me,

749
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:30,551
and I will call you tomorrow
after I have nailed the presentation.

750
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,414
- Okay? Thank you very much.
- Harper!

751
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:34,708
- Have a wonderful evening.
- Harper!

752
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:38,754
Okay, all right, here's the thing.
The thing is everything has changed.

753
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:41,298
There's no longer a dinner meeting.
It's at 11 a.m.

754
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:43,141
and our flight lands
in Barcelona at ten a.m.

755
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:47,262
Which means we're cutting it very close,
but guess what, my give-a-fuck meter

756
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:50,641
is at zero, so we're gonna party all night
and just not miss our flight tomorrow.

757
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:52,142
[Leah] Yes!

¿Pasenla muy bien, ay?

761
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:01,568
Hola, tio.

762
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:05,364
- ¿Como estas?
- Tan guapa como siempre, mira las cuidas.

763
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:07,866
- [gasps] Hello, ladies.
- Hi.

764
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,243
- [laughs]
- Thank you.

765
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:11,078

[Custodia] No, come on.

767

[Lazer] Come on, chop, chop!

768
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:19,378
- I feel good, ladies. Do you feel good?
- Yeah!

769
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:24,466
- Okay, hold the wheel.
- Oh, no.

770

What, no, what are you doing?

771
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:29,763
I need to get this outfit off.

772
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:32,474
Why not pull over
and you can change in leisure.

773
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:35,269
I need to dress like a lady
for my uncle.

774
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:37,980
Whoa! Whoa. Oh.

775

I'll be right back.

776
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:44,236
Don't worry,
I just need to get drugs for my nose.

777
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:47,614
Okay? Good, good, good, good!

778
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:48,866
So happy!

779
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:54,079
Oh, Diego texted me back.
"An unbuttoned silk blouse

780
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:58,500
with my brief and soft, sexy slippers.
What about you?"

781
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:00,919
- What?
- I asked him what he was wearing.

782

Look at you sexting!

783

That's him? Throw out the plan B.

784

He can do a handstand!

785
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:12,681
Fuck that,
like it's a thanksgiving buffet, bitch.

00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:16,602
Don't... don't touch my phone.

787
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:19,438
Guys, when should I call Leo?
Should I call him right now?

788
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:21,690
Just be cool, like the opposite of this.

789
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:25,819
- Okay, I can do that.
- No, that's too much.

790
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:28,322
- No, this is, like, actually blinding me.
- Yeah.

791
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:32,075
- He can't see that strut, either.
- Don't strut.

[both] No, no.

Oh, boy, hold on.
There's something happening.

Anyway, I just wanted to tell you that...

802
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:07,235
[Custodia] You're sweet. Look at you!

803
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,363
I'm sorry, sir, there's no room for you.

804
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:12,282
So you could call me or text me...

Harper, hi...

It's Leo from the other night. Hello.

813
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:40,769
I'm glad you called. How you doing?

814
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:44,856
You can't answer that
because this is a voice mail.

815
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:51,071
I did not expect to hear your voice
when I called back that number.

816
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:53,907
I don't know what I was expecting,
but I wasn't expecting you.

817
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:57,077
I was hoping it was gonna be you,
and it was you.

818
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,538
Which is what I was hoping for,
which is good.

Yes...

Anyway, yeah, I would like
to hear your voice again live.

821
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:10,590
Even better, I'd like to see you live.

822
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:14,219
Live is better than dead.
I don't want to see you dead.

823
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:17,055
Yeah, I wish you'd left a voice mail.

824
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:20,267
I don't know how long you're
in Barcelona for.

how long this voice mail is?

No, neither can I!

I'm just gonna be honest with you.

00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:40,285
I'm on a lot of drugs right now,
and I have flown all the way here,

that I just took off.

of swimming against the stream
or something like that,

975
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:57,468
so I think what you should do
is you tell those promoters

976
00:59:57,552 --> 01:00:00,847
that you are only gonna do half your set
and that you have an emergency

977
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:03,410
and then we're just gonna
spend the rest of the night together.

All right.

979
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:10,457
Are you saying that just to shut me up
or 'cause you actually are saying okay?

980
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:13,443
No, 'cause I'm actually saying okay.
Fuck, I've never done this before.

Yeah, it was good. It was good.

01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:35,097
- Miles!
- I'm coming, sweet pea.

1057
01:05:35,556 --> 01:05:37,224
Wow, he's a lot.

1058
01:05:45,399 --> 01:05:48,694
- Oh, shit, that was hot.
- You're pretty hot.

1059
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,538
- You're pretty hot,
- No, you're pretty hot.

1060
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:51,781
No, you're pretty hot.

1061
01:05:54,408 --> 01:05:55,910
[laughs]

1062
01:06:01,832 --> 01:06:03,000
[camera shutter clicks]

1063
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:09,840
Okay, that's what I call a dick pic.
Check, please.

1064
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:11,926
[scatting]

1065
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:17,807
[shouting]

1066
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:21,018
So, Harper's with a DJ.

1067
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:23,980
Leah's in that room doing whatever,

1068
01:06:24,605 --> 01:06:27,608
and Nikki's in a bathtub.

1069
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:29,777
Classic Nikki.

1070
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:42,248
I have never left a gig before, ever.

1071
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:43,331
I want you...

1072
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:46,877
- ...to know that.
- All right.

1073
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:50,923
Not sure I believe you,
Mr. Slutty International DJ.

1074
01:06:52,216 --> 01:06:55,052
Are you slut shaming me?

1075
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:57,513
Yeah, a little bit, I am.

1076
01:06:58,139 --> 01:07:00,891
Well, I'm not the one sitting
in some random guy's hot tub.

1077
01:07:00,975 --> 01:07:04,020
- Oh, got me there.
- Mm-hmm.

1078
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:09,734
I mean, I don't want you to think
that's what I do all the time

1079
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:14,363
or I just, like, pick girls out
and do this and I throw all these lines,

1080
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:17,992
and I don't want you to think that
about me. That's, like, not who I am.

1081
01:07:18,075 --> 01:07:19,075
That's not what...

1082
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:21,078
I believe you.

1083
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:23,997
Good.

1084
01:07:25,666 --> 01:07:28,627
- 'Cause I care about what you think.
- Oh, you do?

1085
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:30,897
I didn't mean to say that.
Did I say that out loud?

1086
01:07:30,921 --> 01:07:33,340
- You said it out loud.
- Oh, God, I hate myself.

1087
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:36,052
That's nice, I like it,
thank you very much.

1088
01:07:40,097 --> 01:07:44,435
- [laughs] I've never dated a guy like you.
- Me neither.

1089
01:07:44,518 --> 01:07:47,772
- What kind of guys do you date?
- Really fucking handsome ones.

1090
01:07:47,855 --> 01:07:50,649
- Ooh!
- Not like this, like handsome.

1091
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:54,403
- Cool, I'd like to meet them.
- [laughs]

1092
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:00,325
Tell me the truth,

1093
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:03,746
have you really never walked out
on a gig before?

1094
01:08:06,665 --> 01:08:07,665
Never.

1095
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:11,712
And you're shit at lying so I believe you.

1096
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:13,506
- Yeah.
- [both laugh]

1097
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:24,349
Click.

1098
01:08:25,726 --> 01:08:28,437
Click, click.

1099
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:32,274
- And what was that?
- That was my mind camera,

1100
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:33,484
taking photographs.

1101
01:08:37,988 --> 01:08:40,533
Click, click, click.

1102
01:08:52,044 --> 01:08:54,755
- I have a flight tomorrow, okay?
- Okay.

1103
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:58,425
Um... [laughs]

1104
01:08:58,551 --> 01:09:00,928
Also, also, don't forget.

1105
01:09:01,011 --> 01:09:04,932
I shouldn't sleep in too late.
My friend said I shouldn't forget that.

1106
01:09:05,015 --> 01:09:07,434
- Um... also...
- Mm-hmm.

1107
01:09:10,604 --> 01:09:14,358
Just a moment,
I'm just having a moment, just a moment.

1108
01:09:14,441 --> 01:09:20,573
It's probably more about the drugs
and the drinking and the Spain.

1109
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:25,119
It's just some sort of European thing,
right? We don't really know each other.

1110
01:09:25,202 --> 01:09:30,457
So this is all pure projection, you know?
Right? 'Cause I don't know.

1111
01:09:30,916 --> 01:09:32,126
My God, oh, shit.

1112
01:09:32,459 --> 01:09:36,463
Perfect, you're flawless,
and that's why this is perfect.

1113
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:42,094
- Or maybe we just like each other.
- [panting]

1114
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:47,850
Oh, God. Or that I'm really fucked.

1115
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:49,434
Me too.

1116
01:10:25,137 --> 01:10:29,016
Fuck! [groaning]

1117
01:10:29,099 --> 01:10:30,099
What?

1118
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:33,145
Fuck!

1119
01:10:35,981 --> 01:10:38,692
- Shit! Fucking alarm!
- What's wrong?

1120
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:40,527
Airport, meeting, job.

1121
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:41,611
Damn.

1122
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:44,031
This is good.

1123
01:10:44,114 --> 01:10:46,742
Oh, you loved that hot tub last night,
didn't you, Harper?

1124
01:10:49,453 --> 01:10:50,453
[Harper] No!

1125
01:10:51,038 --> 01:10:54,458
You're gonna get fired.
Everyone's gonna hate you.

1126
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:59,338
Your mom is gonna be
so fucking disappointed in you.

1127
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:02,883
How are you going to explain this?
How are you going to explain this?

1128
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:04,093
You can't!

1129
01:11:04,176 --> 01:11:07,346
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

1130
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:11,433
It's all good. It's all good.
I'm gonna be fired,

1131
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:13,686
and I have to be in Barcelona
in five minutes, so...

1132
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:15,664
It's all right. I'll come to the airport
with you, all right?

1133
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:20,317
- Okay, how do I look?
- Let's go, just don't look that way.

1134
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:21,485
Off we go.

1135
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:24,530
[Nikki] I knew it. Where is she?

1136
01:11:25,197 --> 01:11:28,867
- Stop screaming.
- Okay, we wait, like, five minutes max.

1137
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:31,328
Then we call the police,
we go on Anderson Cooper,

1138
01:11:31,412 --> 01:11:34,540
- we start an investigation.
- No, stop, stop, stop.

1139
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:38,752
- They're boarding now. We just gotta go.
- [sighs] All right.

1140
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:44,133
- She's so fired.
- Stop saying it.

1141
01:11:44,216 --> 01:11:47,094
We're gonna figure this out.
I have a good plan.

1142
01:11:49,763 --> 01:11:51,283
- I can't believe I did this!
- Stop it, it's all right.

1143
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:53,225
[inhaling and exhaling]

1144
01:11:54,935 --> 01:11:56,770
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

1145
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:01,317
What are you doing?

1146
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:04,653
I just want one picture
that you've not got a dick on your face.

1147
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:06,864
You have to delete that.
You promised me you would.

1148
01:12:06,947 --> 01:12:07,823
- Don't make me.
- Why?

1149
01:12:07,906 --> 01:12:09,676
Because it's how we met
and we'll show it to our kids one day.

1150
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:11,327
Our kids? Are you kidding me?

1151
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:14,413
With global warming,
we've got, like, ten years left, max.

1152
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:20,919
- [Harper] Are you okay? I'm good.
- Yeah, yeah, just...

1153
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:22,254
[Harper] Right there.

1154
01:12:38,103 --> 01:12:39,980
I don't want to say goodbye.

1155
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:41,314
Me neither.

1156
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:44,360
Uh... [clears throat]

1157
01:12:44,568 --> 01:12:47,571
Well, thank you
for coming to the airport with me.

1158
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:53,619
- Thank you for coming to Ibiza for me.
- I didn't come to Ibiza for you...

1159
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:55,704
Fuck it, I did, I did.

1160
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:03,253
Um... Okay, I have to go.

1161
01:13:04,004 --> 01:13:06,006
You know, I've never met anyone like you.

1162
01:13:07,591 --> 01:13:09,343
- And you know how I know that?
- Hmm?

1163
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:13,972
Because if I did, I'd make sure
I still knew that person.

1164
01:13:20,813 --> 01:13:23,107
Okay. [laughs]

1165
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:29,279
If I don't see you again,
this was really fun and...

1166
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:31,949
...I'm glad.

1167
01:13:52,052 --> 01:13:55,722
- More nasally if you could,
- Hi, I'm Harper.

1168
01:13:55,973 --> 01:14:01,019
I'm beautiful, but insecure in a way
that makes my friends very frustrated.

1169
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:03,939
I just threw clothes together
and somehow, they look so cool.

1170
01:14:04,022 --> 01:14:05,482
I'm Harper.

1171
01:14:05,566 --> 01:14:07,484
By the way, 100%.

1172
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:09,194
I'm selling you the sangria.

1173
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:12,948
- I mean, you're selling me the sangria.
- That was good.

1174
01:14:14,366 --> 01:14:16,660
- Oh.
- You look so beautiful.

1175
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:26,670
- I brought you clothes.
- Oh, thank you.

1176
01:14:26,753 --> 01:14:27,753
You're sweet.

1177
01:14:28,255 --> 01:14:30,841
- [Leah] Hey, girl, ready to do this?
- [Diego] Hello.

1178
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:38,724
Okay, I gotta go. I gotta go.
Okay, I'm so sorry. I gotta go.

1179
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:40,225
Sorry, I have an emergency!

1180
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:46,190
Nikki, this is going to be perfect.
You're a genius.

1181
01:14:46,273 --> 01:14:50,027
You're amazing and most importantly,
you look damn good.

1182
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:53,739
I kind of know that I do,
and I feel like Harper,

1183
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:56,116
but maybe, like, more professional.

1184
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:59,536
Oh, yes, Susie Orman over here, okay!

1185
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:02,581
Nothing to see,
just getting business done.

1186
01:15:04,374 --> 01:15:06,835
Oh, were you guys wondering
about strategies?

1187
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:09,296
That's what business people know,
like me.

1188
01:15:10,422 --> 01:15:13,300
Hello, sir,
please don't eavesdrop on my business.

1189
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:27,147
- Harper, this is Guillermo.
- Yes, nice... mm-hmm.

1190
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:28,273
Okay.

1191
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:33,028
And I've corresponded with you
in the emails and such things.

1192
01:15:33,111 --> 01:15:35,948
- Yes, and Jose.
- Jose, okay.

1193
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:38,242
We have communicated via emails as well.

1194
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:39,993
This is amazing.

1195
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:42,704
I'm a goddamn mastermind.

1196
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:58,262
- Leah, Leah!
- Oh, my God, Harper!

1197
01:15:58,345 --> 01:16:01,014
- Holy shit, you're safe. You scared me.
- I'm safe.

1198
01:16:01,098 --> 01:16:03,392
I fucked up, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna get fired.

1199
01:16:03,475 --> 01:16:07,271
You're not. Nikki and I have a plan,
just hold on to your shorts.

1200
01:16:07,354 --> 01:16:12,526
Here's a question. Who at this table
wants to get filthy fucking rich?

1201
01:16:12,609 --> 01:16:16,071
- What is she doing in there?
- Taking the meeting as you. It's fine.

1202
01:16:16,154 --> 01:16:19,157
- I got to get in there...
- Oh, no, you reek of sex.

1203
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:22,953
Like, high-five but also,
that's some ho business.

1204
01:16:23,036 --> 01:16:26,290
Look, she's like a white Steve Jobs.
She's got this. It's fine.

1205
01:16:26,373 --> 01:16:28,709
What you might notice
about both of these charts

1206
01:16:28,792 --> 01:16:31,461
is that the line thingy in them
is going up.

1207
01:16:31,545 --> 01:16:36,133
Three words for you,
virtual, reality, experience.

1208
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:40,804
That would require us
hiring some kind of technology...

1209
01:16:41,388 --> 01:16:44,683
person who worked in virtual reality,
but at the end of the day....

1210
01:16:46,518 --> 01:16:49,229
She's touching Diego
an uncomfortable amount.

1211
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:54,526
Yeah, they full on boned.
He fucked the confidence into her.

1212
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:55,944
She's so animated.

1213
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:58,071
Sorry, self driving cars,
we've got Sangria.

[kisses] Perfect!

1216
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:05,329
Well, I do very accurate accents.

1217
01:17:05,412 --> 01:17:08,081
Harper, you make a wonderful argument
for your company

1218
01:17:08,165 --> 01:17:11,960
and seem to understand the vision
of our brand very well.

1219
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:16,506
- Thank you.
- I think it is no-brainer. We shake hands.

1220
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:20,052
We can have some more drinks
and from now on,

1221
01:17:20,135 --> 01:17:23,472
we can say we are in business.

1222
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:25,515
Oh, thank you, thank you!

1223
01:17:25,599 --> 01:17:27,601
[cheering]

1224
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:30,479
[Harper] Oh, my God, this is awesome!

1225
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:33,982
- Wait. Why is he getting his laptop?
- It's fine, it's fine.

1226
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:37,027
- It's a computer. Just... oh, no.
- Oh, no.

1227
01:17:37,611 --> 01:17:40,489
Is this a good news call?
It feels like it is.

1228
01:17:40,572 --> 01:17:44,534
Why, yes, it is. We are here with Harper,
and she's wonderful.

1229
01:17:45,744 --> 01:17:47,704
- Go to the bathroom.
- Hey, Harper!

1230
01:17:47,788 --> 01:17:48,788
Say hello to your boss!

1231
01:17:48,872 --> 01:17:50,957
Hello.

1232
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:53,001
No, oh, no, no, no!

1233
01:17:53,085 --> 01:17:55,921
- Harper, say hello.
- Sorry, who is that?

1234
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:59,466
Who is that? Who the fuck is that?

1235
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:01,968
- Hi, it's Harper!
- Harper!

1236
01:18:02,094 --> 01:18:03,553
Where the fuck are you?

1237
01:18:04,638 --> 01:18:08,600
Hi, I was in the bathroom, so I'm here,
the deal's going really well.

1238
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:11,124
I think they are gonna go for it,
and I think it's been great!

1239
01:18:11,186 --> 01:18:14,439
Holy fucking shit, you get any sleep
while you were in Spain?

1240
01:18:14,564 --> 01:18:17,484
No, but it's 'cause I was working
really hard,

1241
01:18:17,984 --> 01:18:20,821
all night, on my presentation.

1242
01:18:20,904 --> 01:18:23,156
- What the hell is going on?
- I honestly don't know,

1243
01:18:23,281 --> 01:18:25,909
- but there are two Harpers.
- Harper!

1244
01:18:25,992 --> 01:18:27,637
When you get back,
I'm gonna rip your face apart,

1245
01:18:27,661 --> 01:18:29,621
like a goddamn pit bull...

1246
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:32,165
Oh, you wanted to talk to this Harper?

1247
01:18:32,290 --> 01:18:34,251
- That's where the confusion...
- Harper!

1248
01:18:34,334 --> 01:18:36,753
Bye. Okay.

1249
01:18:36,878 --> 01:18:37,878
I really...

1250
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:40,006
...I do love your sangria.

1251
01:18:40,590 --> 01:18:41,800

[Leah] Okay, okay.

1255
01:19:01,903 --> 01:19:03,613
- First you need to...
- [Nikki] Sit up

1256
01:19:03,697 --> 01:19:06,575
because you don't want a lot
of exposed skin on the jizz.

1257
01:19:06,658 --> 01:19:09,035
- Too much exposed skin.
- There's a lot of jizz here.

1258

You know,

1284
01:21:02,023 --> 01:21:04,651
I thought about turning the pictures
of the twins around

1285
01:21:04,734 --> 01:21:06,027
when I met with you today,

1286
01:21:06,111 --> 01:21:09,406
because didn't want them to see this,
but you know maybe

1287
01:21:09,489 --> 01:21:11,908
this is a real teachable moment
for them to see mommy

1288
01:21:11,992 --> 01:21:16,121
- try to steer you in a direction.
- Okay.

1289
01:21:17,372 --> 01:21:19,875
So let me just start by saying,

1290
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:24,462
- I'm really fucking disappointed in you!
- I know.

1291
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:29,175
I gave you adult responsibility,
thinking, "Oh, what? Maybe she'll grow up

1292
01:21:29,259 --> 01:21:32,304
and show me she's got what it takes
to move up in this job."

1293
01:21:32,387 --> 01:21:33,847
- Okay.
- Yeah, but instead,

1294
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:36,766
you treat it like
a goddamn Coachella vacation,

1295
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:41,062
fiesta, bonita, Mad Max, shit parade.
Giving blowies for gelato

1296
01:21:41,146 --> 01:21:44,107
and stripping for tapas
with your little slut bucket friends.

1297
01:21:44,190 --> 01:21:45,190
Ow.

1298
01:21:48,695 --> 01:21:50,756
- Are you firing me?
- Oh, yeah, fuck yes, I am, yes.

Fuck yes.

1300

Well, in that case,

1301
01:21:55,744 --> 01:21:57,996
I have a few things
that I would like to say to you.

1302
01:22:00,373 --> 01:22:02,918
- I hate you.
- Oh, well, join the club.

1303

I hate you,
and I feel sorry for your twins.

1304
01:22:06,504 --> 01:22:08,381
You're a terrible person,

1305
01:22:08,465 --> 01:22:12,928
and you are an awful boss,
and everyone here hates you,

1306
01:22:13,386 --> 01:22:16,348
- and you're not even good at your job.
- Excuse me.

therefore voiding my non-compete clause

1309
01:22:22,646 --> 01:22:25,440
so I can call Disfrute,
sign them as a client

01:22:25,523 --> 01:22:28,193
and steal all your goddamn clients.

You just met your competition.

- [Leah] Yeah.

1330
01:23:16,074 --> 01:23:17,492
I've been emailing with Diego

1331
01:23:17,575 --> 01:23:20,245
and he said that his bosses
did love my presentation.

1332
01:23:20,328 --> 01:23:23,081
They didn't even mind
about the whole charade thing.

1333
01:23:23,581 --> 01:23:26,751
And it seems like
I might actually score them as a client,

1334
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:28,211
and I could start my own firm.

1335
01:23:28,294 --> 01:23:30,130
Wow, that's amazing.

1336
01:23:30,213 --> 01:23:34,592
I know. And did Diego say he might
be coming to the city soon?

1337
01:23:34,676 --> 01:23:39,639
Yes! You guys, I've gotten so much better
at sexting. How's this one?

1338
01:23:40,223 --> 01:23:44,894
You are my guapo fajita,
sizzling the fire in my loins.

1339
01:23:45,478 --> 01:23:48,773
Okay, sure, if he's into it,
who cares what we think, right?

1340
01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:51,776
You know, lbiza's been
pretty life changing for me, too.

1341
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:55,447
Like, I'm thinking about settling down,
popping out a couple of babies.

1342
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:57,949
- Just like real norm core shit.

01:24:14,466 --> 01:24:15,592
Hello.

1347

- [Leo] Hello.
- [laughs]

1348
01:24:18,678 --> 01:24:21,181
I've got a a layover in Paris.
I thought I'd call and leave you

1349
01:24:21,264 --> 01:24:23,641
a rambling voice mail,
but you've answered instead,

1350
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:25,727
which is much, much better.

1351
01:24:25,810 --> 01:24:27,687
It's crazy to hear your voice.

1352

Crazy, like good crazy or...

1353

Great crazy.

Yeah, me too.

1356
01:24:45,163 --> 01:24:47,457
- Do you want to come to Tokyo?
- What?

1357
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:52,378
I'm playing there this weekend, so come.
Do you want to come on me?

1358
01:24:52,462 --> 01:24:55,256
We can go to the Kyoto Gardens.

1359
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:57,801
There's this fucking robot bar.

1360
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,345
Uh...

1361
01:25:00,428 --> 01:25:04,182
- That's insane.
- I know, like fucking robots

1362
01:25:04,265 --> 01:25:07,143
to give you drinks. I don't know
if they actually give you the drinks...

1363
01:25:08,019 --> 01:25:10,772
Tokyo you're talking about that's insane,
isn't it, not the robots.

1364
01:25:10,855 --> 01:25:12,649
Uh, okay. Um...

1365
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:15,900
What what do you say?
Do you want to come to Tokyo?

1366
01:25:22,367 --> 01:25:23,701
I would love to.

1367
01:25:24,452 --> 01:25:27,080
But now I'm just starting
this new business,

1368
01:25:27,163 --> 01:25:29,082
and I can't.

1369
01:25:31,584 --> 01:25:33,711
Any chance you'll be coming
to New York soon?

1370
01:25:35,296 --> 01:25:37,715
Yeah. Yeah, New York.

1371
01:25:39,342 --> 01:25:41,928
- I'd like that.
- I would like that, too.

1372
01:25:42,595 --> 01:25:44,180
I would really like that.

I had a really good time with you.

1374

I like you.

1376
01:25:57,694 --> 01:25:58,736
I like you, too.

1377
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:02,991
Okay, I'm gonna stop talking now.
This is worse than my voice mails,

1378
01:26:03,074 --> 01:26:06,077
but I will call you.
I'll call you when I land.

Okay.

Bye, Harper.

Bye.

1383
01:26:31,686 --> 01:26:32,896
So...

1384
01:26:34,981 --> 01:26:36,816
Leo asked me to meet him in Tokyo.

1385
01:26:37,984 --> 01:26:39,319
And I said no.

1386
01:26:39,402 --> 01:26:41,487
I told him he had to come to me.

1387
01:26:42,238 --> 01:26:45,491
- Oh!
- Okay, yes, feminism.

1390
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:53,583
- you should have gone.
- Yeah, I mean, the feminism is too much

1391
01:26:53,708 --> 01:26:57,295
in this situation and being too feminist
is anti-feminist.

1392

Stop it at wearing pants.

1393
01:26:59,589 --> 01:27:02,508
If he wants to see me,
he has to come to me.

1394
01:27:02,592 --> 01:27:05,511
I'm not gonna keep flying
around the world to see him.

1395
01:27:05,595 --> 01:27:09,515
We'll go to Tokyo with him,
and then we'll come back here,

1396
01:27:09,599 --> 01:27:12,143
- and then you'll make him come to you.
- Right.

1397
01:27:12,727 --> 01:27:13,727
No.
