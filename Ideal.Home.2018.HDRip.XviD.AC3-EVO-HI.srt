Piece of shit knocks me around,

That was real fucking Chanel!

16
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:57,846
I have some Chanel loafers
that I love,

17
00:00:57,848 --> 00:00:59,281
so I totally get it.

Open up, please, right now.

Oh. Goddamn it.

Inside the cover of that Bible,

00:01:22,639 --> 00:01:23,938
there's an address in Santa Fe.

27
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,441
- Get in a cab and go there.
- No!

Listen, it's better than
Child Protective Services.

You gotta trust me on that one.

Oh, hello!
And good morning.

Have you never been invited
to a ranchero breakfast?

45
00:02:39,581 --> 00:02:43,418
Well, my friends, on this
glorious day, you are in luck.

46
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,453
- Because we...
- [man] Are you okay?

47
00:02:45,455 --> 00:02:46,520
You're leaning.

48
00:02:46,522 --> 00:02:47,923
It's a Western saddle.

49
00:02:47,925 --> 00:02:49,623
I can't sit forward
like the English.

50
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:52,727
Cowboys sit back on their
haunches up against the cantle.

Oh! Ugh!

Oh, God.

53
00:03:00,403 --> 00:03:02,503
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I think so.

54
00:03:02,505 --> 00:03:05,240
You know, we don't have to do
the scene on horseback.

55
00:03:05,242 --> 00:03:07,341
I want to.
It's... it's important.

56
00:03:07,343 --> 00:03:09,978
It adds to the masculinity.
It adds to the grandeur.

57
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,746
Well, that's true.

58
00:03:11,748 --> 00:03:13,215
- Are you being facetious?
- Mm-hmm.

59
00:03:13,217 --> 00:03:15,584
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

60
00:03:15,586 --> 00:03:16,785
Thank you so much.

61
00:03:16,787 --> 00:03:19,821
You are a gentleman.
You really are.

62
00:03:19,823 --> 00:03:22,557
God knows they're in short
supply around here.

63
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:23,891
Oh, my God.

64
00:03:23,893 --> 00:03:25,492
Would you quit flirting
with him?

65
00:03:25,494 --> 00:03:27,395
It makes him feel awkward,
and he's straight.

66
00:03:27,397 --> 00:03:30,733
No, it makes you feel awkward,
and he's gay.

67
00:03:30,735 --> 00:03:32,266
Well, it makes everyone
feel awkward

68
00:03:32,268 --> 00:03:34,836
watching you act
like a weird old woman.

69
00:03:34,838 --> 00:03:37,104
No, <i>you're</i> a weird
old woman.

70
00:03:37,106 --> 00:03:38,906
You want
to know something?

71
00:03:38,908 --> 00:03:43,079
I could've worked for
Rachel Ray, and she's nice.

[vocalizes in mocking tone]

00:03:45,381 --> 00:03:47,948
How about we just take it
from the first line?

74
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,450
I'd be delighted.

75
00:03:49,452 --> 00:03:51,453

This is a Basque oven paddle

82
00:04:32,462 --> 00:04:35,297
that I have repurposed
as a tapas tray.

83
00:04:35,299 --> 00:04:37,866
I like to serve
my stuffed paquillo peppers

84
00:04:37,868 --> 00:04:39,734
on the back of a horse.

85
00:04:39,736 --> 00:04:45,205
Mind you, a vaquero breakfast
needn't be on a vast rancho.

86
00:04:45,207 --> 00:04:47,409
When we return,
I'll show you how you can cook

87
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:51,780
some of this gorgeous food
in your own little kitchen.

88
00:04:51,782 --> 00:04:53,047
Ciao.

89
00:04:53,049 --> 00:04:55,116
Dig in, amigos.

90
00:04:55,118 --> 00:04:57,451
Manny, you old cock hound.
I didn't see you there.

91
00:04:57,453 --> 00:05:00,487
You can't say "cock hound"
on basic cable.

92
00:05:00,489 --> 00:05:01,925
Cut.

93
00:05:02,825 --> 00:05:06,160
Get rid of
the terra-cotta pots. Yuck.

94
00:05:06,162 --> 00:05:08,328
Ditto the galvanized tin.

95
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:12,333
Please, please remove the ghastly
bandannas from the goblets.

96
00:05:12,335 --> 00:05:16,672
You, young man, put your camera
there pointing that way.

97
00:05:16,674 --> 00:05:18,039
Look at him.

98
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,907
He's like
the gay Butch Cassidy

99
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:21,609
except not Butch.

100
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:25,547
If only we had a producer
who understood that objects

101
00:05:25,549 --> 00:05:27,049
exist in a space.

102
00:05:27,051 --> 00:05:28,282
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

103
00:05:28,284 --> 00:05:29,885
If only you came
to production meetings

104
00:05:29,887 --> 00:05:31,753
to communicate
your ideas in advance.

105
00:05:31,755 --> 00:05:34,321
Oh, but that would cut
into your rigorous drinking

106
00:05:34,323 --> 00:05:36,023
and masturbation schedule.

Do you guys do this at home?

109
00:05:38,762 --> 00:05:41,899
Oh, no, we don't get along
this well at home.

110
00:05:42,832 --> 00:05:44,698
Why don't you leave him?

111
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,267
I probably will.

112
00:05:46,269 --> 00:05:47,669
But, you know,
part of me wants

113
00:05:47,671 --> 00:05:49,837
to stick around
just to watch him die.

114

00:06:02,852 --> 00:06:05,886
Oh, can we call a truce?

117
00:06:05,888 --> 00:06:07,321
Yes.

118
00:06:07,323 --> 00:06:08,623
Thank you.

119
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,325
Finally.

120
00:06:10,327 --> 00:06:11,525
Finally?

121
00:06:11,527 --> 00:06:14,128
When have you ever
called for a truce?

122
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:17,232
You realize you're starting
an argument about a truce.

123
00:06:17,234 --> 00:06:21,936
I think you are manipulative
and passive-aggressive,

124
00:06:21,938 --> 00:06:23,304
and the truce starts now.

125
00:06:23,306 --> 00:06:29,112
Ah! My favorite Mexicans.
<i>Me llamo Mexico.</i>

126
00:06:45,794 --> 00:06:48,395
[woman] So we just got back
from Machu Picchu,

127
00:06:48,397 --> 00:06:50,765
and there's nothing there.
Not impressed. Not impressed.

128
00:06:50,767 --> 00:06:52,267
It just looks like
the Flintstones village.

129
00:06:52,269 --> 00:06:53,835
I'm like, "This is it?
This is it?"

130
00:06:53,837 --> 00:06:56,169
- Not impressed. Zero stars.
- What do you like?

131
00:06:56,171 --> 00:06:58,106
- I like Epcot.
- [scoffs]

132
00:06:58,108 --> 00:07:01,075
Bobby Flay,
I like him as a person.

133
00:07:01,077 --> 00:07:02,410
You know he's
one of my best friends.

134
00:07:02,412 --> 00:07:04,611
No, no,
no don't get me wrong.

135
00:07:04,613 --> 00:07:06,347
He's got a wonderful face

136
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:10,251
and, you know...
[stammers] marvelous chutzpah.

137
00:07:10,253 --> 00:07:12,520
Are you from LA?

138
00:07:12,522 --> 00:07:13,688
I'm the mayor.

139
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:14,821
Wait, what?

140
00:07:14,823 --> 00:07:18,126
- Of Santa Fe.
- Oh, I love that.

141
00:07:18,128 --> 00:07:20,695
This close
to the border of Syria.

142
00:07:20,697 --> 00:07:22,028
You can hear the gunfire.

143
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:24,366
You hear people screaming.
Terrifying.

144
00:07:24,368 --> 00:07:27,268
But the za'atar chicken

145
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,770
was the best I've ever had.

146
00:07:28,772 --> 00:07:30,804
- Mouthwatering.
- And the screaming children

147
00:07:30,806 --> 00:07:32,174
didn't bother
the food at all?

148
00:07:32,176 --> 00:07:35,008
- Apples and oranges.
- You got to eat.

149
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,109
It's the city of holy faith...

150
00:07:36,111 --> 00:07:37,611
- Oh.
- Santa Fe.

151
00:07:37,613 --> 00:07:40,616
That's so cool.
I love that.

152
00:07:42,152 --> 00:07:43,585
[woman]
And I'm like, "Hey, asshole,

153
00:07:43,587 --> 00:07:46,087
the fucking Dalai Lama
gave me that purse."

155
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:52,027
Ladies and gentlemen,
please join me in a toast

156
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:55,196
to two of the finest
hosts in Santa Fe.

157
00:07:55,198 --> 00:07:57,698
What am I talking about?
The world.

158
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,133
Paul, Erasmus.

159
00:07:59,135 --> 00:08:01,369
And if I may interrupt there,
Mr. Mayor,

160
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:03,772
let's not forget
all the little people,

161
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:06,407
all the worker bees
out there whoever they are.

162
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:08,910
- The little people.

00:08:08,912 --> 00:08:10,344
[woman]
Well put.

164
00:08:10,346 --> 00:08:13,481
- I am with such an asshole.
- [laughter]

165
00:08:13,483 --> 00:08:15,982
I love an asshole.
So to speak.

166
00:08:15,984 --> 00:08:17,919
[laughter]

167
00:08:17,921 --> 00:08:19,119
Cheers to that.

168
00:08:19,121 --> 00:08:20,621
- Cheers to that!
- Double cheers!

[indistinct conversations]

171
00:09:00,328 --> 00:09:03,130
[woman 1] I mean, it is Santa Fe, right?
It's a little on the nose.

172
00:09:03,132 --> 00:09:05,532
I just get sick
of all the turquoise.

173
00:09:05,534 --> 00:09:07,100
It gets a little over...
I mean, no disrespect.

174
00:09:07,102 --> 00:09:08,603
- You look great.
- [woman 2] Thanks.

175
00:09:08,605 --> 00:09:11,540
Yeah.
Oh, hello, who are you?

176
00:09:11,542 --> 00:09:13,177
Um...

177
00:09:16,112 --> 00:09:19,582
Oh. Erasmus.

178
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,151
Well, someone can't spell
my name.

179
00:09:23,153 --> 00:09:27,124
"Dear Arosmus.
This is your grandson."

180
00:09:29,292 --> 00:09:32,659
Is... Is your father here?

181
00:09:32,661 --> 00:09:35,330
Was he here?
Has he gone? Wh...?

182
00:09:35,332 --> 00:09:39,736
What's your name?
Um, do you have a name?

183
00:09:42,438 --> 00:09:44,638
Um, can we get
another chair, please?

184
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,173
- [woman chuckles]
- [man] Please.

185
00:09:47,175 --> 00:09:49,378
Is that all you have
with you?

186
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,150
Well, we've got a Bible.

187
00:09:55,084 --> 00:10:00,388
Some cash.
And a bag of cocaine.

188
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,556
Hmm.

189
00:10:01,558 --> 00:10:02,923
All anyone really
needs in life, eh?

190
00:10:02,925 --> 00:10:05,893
- [people chuckle]
- No clothes, I see.

191
00:10:05,895 --> 00:10:08,662
I'll call the store.
They're about to close.

192
00:10:08,664 --> 00:10:11,235
Oh. Oh, good.

[clears throat]

00:10:14,102 --> 00:10:16,171
Um, everyone,
it would appear

195
00:10:16,173 --> 00:10:19,543
this little chap
is my grandson.

196
00:10:22,145 --> 00:10:24,579
The truth is,
Sandy Koufax had a huge dong.

197
00:10:24,581 --> 00:10:26,580
- [man] Really?
- [woman] Huge dong. Legendary.

198
00:10:26,582 --> 00:10:28,983
- Legendarily huge dong.
- [woman 2] Is that true?

199
00:10:28,985 --> 00:10:30,585
[woman]
That is true. For a Jew.

200
00:10:30,587 --> 00:10:31,788
Excuse me.

201
00:10:32,789 --> 00:10:34,888
You have a grandson?

202
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,391
It's unbelievable, isn't it?

203
00:10:36,393 --> 00:10:40,295
I mean, look.
I've had no work done.

204
00:10:40,297 --> 00:10:42,396
I only found out you had
a son a few years ago.

205
00:10:42,398 --> 00:10:44,831
He's estranged.
I told you about him.

206
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,234
No, not really.

207
00:10:46,236 --> 00:10:49,003
Well, back in the '80s
when I was experimenting,

208
00:10:49,005 --> 00:10:54,642
I had a liaison with a woman
which resulted in a baby...

209
00:10:54,644 --> 00:10:57,411
yuck...
which she wanted to keep.

210
00:10:57,413 --> 00:11:00,348
And... This is
all very murky.

211
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,249
I was probably off my tits
on Quaaludes.

212
00:11:02,251 --> 00:11:05,485
Remember them?
What a blast.

213
00:11:05,487 --> 00:11:10,490
Anywho, before you came along,
darling, I had a son called Bo

214
00:11:10,492 --> 00:11:12,860
who dropped out of school,
developed a drug problem.

215
00:11:12,862 --> 00:11:15,763
He even OD'ed at my book launch
in New York.

216
00:11:15,765 --> 00:11:17,831
No. How embarrassing
for you.

217
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,167
Well, it was.
Anna Wintour was there.

218
00:11:20,169 --> 00:11:21,835
Wait.
Where's the father?

219
00:11:21,837 --> 00:11:24,339
According to the note,
he's in jail.

220
00:11:24,341 --> 00:11:25,706
Yes, he's in jail.

221
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:30,043
- So he's moving in?
- Just keep an eye on him.

222
00:11:30,045 --> 00:11:31,579
We can't have a kid.

223
00:11:31,581 --> 00:11:33,013
We couldn't even handle
that little rat bastard

224
00:11:33,015 --> 00:11:34,114
Yorkshire Terrier.

225
00:11:34,116 --> 00:11:35,483
Thank God for that coyote.

226
00:11:35,485 --> 00:11:37,018
Problem solved,
but a kid's too much.

227
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,553
Calm down, I'm sure someone
from Social Services

228
00:11:39,555 --> 00:11:41,489
will turn up on the doorstep
and tell us where we stand.

229
00:11:41,491 --> 00:11:42,824
Just take one of your pills.

230
00:11:42,826 --> 00:11:44,291
Why don't you take
one of your pills?

231
00:11:44,293 --> 00:11:45,627
That reminds me.

232
00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:47,128
What are we going
to do about this?

233
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,129
I mean,
I don't do cocaine anymore,

234
00:11:49,131 --> 00:11:50,931
but it seems such
a dreadful waste.

235
00:11:50,933 --> 00:11:53,433
We could put it in one
of Tatyana's charity auctions.

236
00:11:53,435 --> 00:11:55,201
- Perfect.
- I'm kidding.

237
00:11:55,203 --> 00:11:57,172
We'd go to jail.

238
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:00,309
Oh.
Do you want a blow job?

239
00:12:02,411 --> 00:12:06,413
- We have guests.
- Yes, you're right.

240
00:12:06,415 --> 00:12:08,550
[man] Have a good night, guys.
Thanks so much.

Hey. So people are going
so you can deal with the kid.

No. Don't go, Kate.

243
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,356
No. I have a bleaching
in the morning.

244
00:12:16,358 --> 00:12:17,660
For my teeth.

245

Everyone is leaving.

246
00:12:21,997 --> 00:12:24,565
This is the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.

247
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:26,066
Just tell us
what you want,

00:12:26,068 --> 00:12:27,569
and someone will make it
for you.

I want Taco Bell.

250

Let's just go to the kitchen.
Maybe we can...

251
00:12:30,972 --> 00:12:32,340
Don't touch me!

00:12:32,342 --> 00:12:33,740
It's all right.
It's okay.

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

00:12:38,881 --> 00:12:40,782
Okay, would you
nut up for second?

256
00:12:40,784 --> 00:12:42,550
Here's what
you're going to do.

257
00:12:42,552 --> 00:12:44,252
You're going to get
the mayor a shot of mescal.

258
00:12:44,254 --> 00:12:45,952
You're going to ask the editor
of <i>El Decor</i> to dance.

259
00:12:45,954 --> 00:12:47,754
I'm going to tell Gustavo
to play some tangos

260
00:12:47,756 --> 00:12:50,425
and get Tino to take
that feral child the Taco Bell.

261
00:12:50,427 --> 00:12:52,060
Then you're going to go
to the front door,

262
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,360
tell everybody to come back

263
00:12:53,362 --> 00:12:54,762
because you got me
a birthday cake,

264
00:12:54,764 --> 00:12:56,464
we're going to sing,
and there's cocaine.

265
00:12:56,466 --> 00:12:59,403
Yes, but I haven't,
and it's not your birthday.

266
00:13:00,535 --> 00:13:02,836
It is your birthday.

267
00:13:02,838 --> 00:13:04,971
Go. Go. Go.

268
00:13:04,973 --> 00:13:06,141
Hey, everyone!

269
00:13:06,143 --> 00:13:08,643

and birthday cake!

[Erasmus] Well, this would be
the point where you say,

00:13:38,775 --> 00:13:42,310
"Erasmus, it's <i>marvelous!"</i>

275
00:13:42,312 --> 00:13:45,916
It's like staying
at a five-star resort!

00:13:47,016 --> 00:13:49,550
I look like
a fucking asshole in these.

Hey, hey...

00:14:05,101 --> 00:14:06,367
Never say that.

283
00:14:06,369 --> 00:14:08,002
You should always
care passionately

about every single choice
you make in your life.

We're locking our doors.

That kid scares
the shit out of me.

- Oh, I think he's sweet.
- Really?

289
00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:26,921
Well, people thought
Jeffrey Dahmer was sweet

290
00:14:26,923 --> 00:14:28,989
till he raped them
and ate them.

291
00:14:28,991 --> 00:14:30,758
Ew.

292
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,561
I'm sure it's just
a temporary arrangement.

293
00:14:33,563 --> 00:14:35,562
What if it's not?

294
00:14:35,564 --> 00:14:40,468
Well, would that be
such a bad thing?

295
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:43,604
My parents were
such drunkaholic messes.

296
00:14:43,606 --> 00:14:45,940
I was 11 years old before
I realized my father's name

297
00:14:45,942 --> 00:14:47,974
wasn't
"that fucking bastard."

298
00:14:47,976 --> 00:14:51,678
Heh. You told me
that joke before.

299
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,449
I'm so sorry. I'll try
and work on some new material.

300
00:14:55,451 --> 00:14:57,551
Thank you.

301
00:14:57,553 --> 00:14:58,985
They were terrible parents,

302
00:14:58,987 --> 00:15:00,687
and I don't want
to be a terrible parent.

303
00:15:00,689 --> 00:15:05,158
- No one's asking you to be.
- Oh, God.

304
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,228
I feel like I'm going to have
one of my things.

305
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,663
- What things?
- My panic things.

306
00:15:09,665 --> 00:15:13,868
I shouldn't have done blow.
I'm such a douchebag.

307
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:17,338
- Well, take one of your pills.
- I did.

308
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:21,008
You know, the editor
of El Decor was dancing

309
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,575
like her
life depended on it.

310
00:15:22,577 --> 00:15:23,945
If she'd gone home early,

311
00:15:23,947 --> 00:15:25,613
the party would've been
a disaster.

312
00:15:25,615 --> 00:15:28,181
We should check in,
make sure everything's okay.

313
00:15:28,183 --> 00:15:30,183
What, with the editor?

314
00:15:30,185 --> 00:15:31,451
Hmm? No, the kid.

315
00:15:31,453 --> 00:15:33,421
Oh, he'll be fast asleep.

316
00:15:33,423 --> 00:15:34,755
We should check in,

317
00:15:34,757 --> 00:15:37,092
make sure
he hasn't stolen anything.

318
00:15:41,664 --> 00:15:43,500
What the hell?

319
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,941
Hey, kid?
What's his name again?

320
00:15:53,943 --> 00:15:56,844
I told you a dozen times,
I don't know.

321
00:15:56,846 --> 00:15:59,816
Kid! K...

322
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,683
Should I call the police?

323
00:16:02,685 --> 00:16:05,719
[Erasmus] No, it's okay,
they're all here. They're safe.

324
00:16:05,721 --> 00:16:08,723
No, not because of your
kachina doll collection.

325
00:16:08,725 --> 00:16:13,597
- Because the kid is missing.
- Oh. Paul.

326
00:16:16,499 --> 00:16:18,666
[Erasmus] Maybe one of us
should take the car into town

327
00:16:18,668 --> 00:16:20,801
- and have a look around.
- Meaning me?

328
00:16:20,803 --> 00:16:23,671
Well, one of us
has got to stay here.

329
00:16:23,673 --> 00:16:25,241
Meaning you?

330
00:16:33,249 --> 00:16:35,185
[whispers]
Erasmus.

331
00:16:40,689 --> 00:16:42,989
[sighs]
Thank God.

332
00:16:42,991 --> 00:16:46,228
I need a drink.
Oh, God.

333
00:16:52,034 --> 00:16:54,369
Hey.

334
00:16:54,371 --> 00:16:55,569
Hey, hey.

335
00:16:55,571 --> 00:16:57,671
- [groans]
- It's okay.

336
00:16:57,673 --> 00:17:00,206
You gave us a scare, kid.

337
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,678
Get away from me, you fag.

338
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:05,582
[door opens]

339
00:17:10,486 --> 00:17:12,019
[Paul]
So what'd the lawyer say?

340
00:17:12,021 --> 00:17:14,355
Nothing, really, just that
the father is in custody,

341
00:17:14,357 --> 00:17:16,256
the mother is dead,
and they're gonna send

342
00:17:16,258 --> 00:17:17,992
someone round
from Social Services.

343
00:17:17,994 --> 00:17:20,861
We can't have a kid.
We don't like kids.

344
00:17:20,863 --> 00:17:23,731
Stop calling him a kid.
He's a child. A kid a baby goat.

345
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:25,899
I'd rather have a baby goat.
Baby goats are cute.

346
00:17:25,901 --> 00:17:29,639
Baby goats won't come and visit
you when you're old and lonely.

347
00:17:30,739 --> 00:17:32,639
Besides, didn't you organize
that Mexican

348
00:17:32,641 --> 00:17:34,140
children charity
or something?

349
00:17:34,142 --> 00:17:36,610
Look, I love helping
children in the abstract,

350
00:17:36,612 --> 00:17:38,878
but I don't want one
in the house.

351
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,214
Hmm.

352
00:17:40,216 --> 00:17:41,948
Well, at any rate, we have
to send it to school.

353
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,817
- Really?
- Yeah, it's the law.

354
00:17:43,819 --> 00:17:47,253
And it gets him out
of the house for the day.

355
00:17:47,255 --> 00:17:50,159
[♪♪♪♪]

356

Hello.

Oh, hello.

358
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:10,244
We would like to enroll
this young man.

359
00:18:10,246 --> 00:18:14,817
All right.
And what is his name?

360
00:18:22,492 --> 00:18:24,694
Would you excuse us,
please?

361
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:35,936
Oh, I see you've discovered
one of my favorite contraptions.

362
00:18:35,938 --> 00:18:40,507
These are such fun.
Let's have a look.

363
00:18:40,509 --> 00:18:44,678
Hmm. You might want to vary
your expression a bit.

364
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:48,651
Scoot along.
Join in with me if you like.

365
00:18:49,884 --> 00:18:52,552
I like to do one happy...

366
00:18:52,554 --> 00:18:54,888
one angry...

367
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,891
one silly...

368
00:18:57,893 --> 00:18:59,693
and one just looking off
into the middle distance,

369
00:18:59,695 --> 00:19:02,866
thinking
about something.

370

[sighs]

371
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:08,838
Now we've got
a bit of an awkward wait.

372
00:19:11,907 --> 00:19:16,842
Oh, look at those.
We're hilarious.

373
00:19:16,844 --> 00:19:18,411
What would you like
to do now?

374

No.

378
00:20:28,217 --> 00:20:31,051
And where have <i>you</i> been?

379
00:20:31,053 --> 00:20:33,186
Ugh. In the editing room.

380
00:20:33,188 --> 00:20:34,888
Trying to make something viable

381
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:38,260
out of your insane
on-camera ramblings.

382
00:20:39,894 --> 00:20:45,698
Paul, do you know that
huge store called Way Mart

383
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,034
or Mall Mart,
something on Cirrillos?

384
00:20:48,036 --> 00:20:50,937
Yeah, of course. It's owned
by some crazy conservatives.

385
00:20:50,939 --> 00:20:52,105
You shouldn't shop there.

386
00:20:52,107 --> 00:20:54,808
I thought it was nirvana.

387
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,878
Everything was so inexpensive.

388
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,579
The effect was intoxicating.

389
00:20:58,581 --> 00:21:02,081
As intoxicating as that
giant tumbler of tequila?

390
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:05,988
Yes.
But in a different way.

391
00:21:07,122 --> 00:21:09,322
- [Paul] He should be in bed.
- Why?

392
00:21:09,324 --> 00:21:11,826
Because it's 2:00
in the morning.

393
00:21:11,828 --> 00:21:13,226
He doesn't have school
in the morning.

394
00:21:13,228 --> 00:21:15,428
I know, because
we haven't enrolled him

395
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,997
because we don't know
his name.

396
00:21:17,999 --> 00:21:19,734
Have a tequila.

397
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:22,069
Oh. I'm so tired.

398

Hey, kid.

I know you're having fun,
but it's very late.

Some tea.

Did you see the photo
for the dust jacket?

Yes, I did.

This is why you need me.

You really, really should have
let me look over these

before you chose the cover,

because you look like

Yes. Yes, he's here

You brought him here?

Yes, of course.
He wants to see you.

Don't bring him back here. It's
gonna screw him up in the head.

You're going to take it,

- Paul is my male companion,

and he has been
for the last 10 years.

Oh.
Well, anyway,

we brought him here

so that
you could see each other

that he's being

Wait. What?

470
00:25:05,861 --> 00:25:08,428
So, it turns out
the county

471
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:11,631
won't allow visits
from children today.

472
00:25:11,633 --> 00:25:13,132
But the lady out front
said that it was...

473
00:25:13,134 --> 00:25:16,403
Without
additional paperwork.

474
00:25:16,405 --> 00:25:19,142
Oh.

475
00:25:20,275 --> 00:25:22,576
- [sighs]
- I have a great idea.

476
00:25:22,578 --> 00:25:24,476
Why don't we go
to a video arcade

477
00:25:24,478 --> 00:25:27,380
- and then get some ice cream?
- [Erasmus] Yeah.

478
00:25:27,382 --> 00:25:30,451
Or we could go to
the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum,

479
00:25:30,453 --> 00:25:33,289

00:33:31,166 --> 00:33:33,000
He was in that film.
What was it called?

641
00:33:33,002 --> 00:33:34,567
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matt...

642
00:33:34,569 --> 00:33:35,936
It's doesn't matter.

643
00:33:35,938 --> 00:33:38,272
It's the only freezer
that's in the garage.

644
00:33:38,274 --> 00:33:39,438
Okay.

645
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,709
Good night.

646
00:33:44,246 --> 00:33:45,444
Do you want some?

647
00:33:45,446 --> 00:33:47,550
[both] No, thank you.

648
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,019
Okay.

649
00:33:51,986 --> 00:33:55,388
Oh, <i>Dances with Wolves!</i>

[alarm stops]

652
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:05,167
We gotta make him lunch.

653
00:34:07,034 --> 00:34:09,171
We have to make him lunch.

654
00:34:11,773 --> 00:34:13,943
We have to make him lunch.

655

[Bill] <i>Taco Bell.</i>

656
00:34:18,213 --> 00:34:20,613
- Pepperoni pizza.
- No.

657
00:34:20,615 --> 00:34:22,782
Come on, man, look.
It's got...

658
00:34:22,784 --> 00:34:26,952
tongue twisters, jokes,
and more mixed-up fun inside.

659
00:34:26,954 --> 00:34:29,354
No.

660
00:34:29,356 --> 00:34:31,759
[sighs]
Oh, God...

661
00:34:34,996 --> 00:34:36,963
All right.
Last offer.

662
00:34:36,965 --> 00:34:40,999
A 2-pound bag
of Sour Patch Kids for lunch.

663
00:34:41,001 --> 00:34:44,303
Candy is for dessert.

664
00:34:44,305 --> 00:34:46,707
You got all the flavors.

665
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:48,008
Blue.

666
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,979
Please.

[muffled scream]

00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,588
Uh, we're still
serving breakfast.

669
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:02,821
For how long?

670
00:35:02,823 --> 00:35:05,658
Uh...
Another 45 minutes.

671
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,997
Oh, fuck you.

672
00:35:13,869 --> 00:35:15,401
Has it been
45 minutes yet?

673
00:35:15,403 --> 00:35:18,370
- No, it's been two.
- [passing truck horn blares]

674
00:35:18,372 --> 00:35:21,774
I want 20 crunch wraps
with bacon, please.

675
00:35:21,776 --> 00:35:24,611
- Twenty?
- Twenty.

676
00:35:24,613 --> 00:35:25,979
Why'd you get 20 of 'em?

677
00:35:25,981 --> 00:35:27,314
Because I'm gonna freeze them

678
00:35:27,316 --> 00:35:29,651
and then thaw them out
every morning.

679
00:35:30,686 --> 00:35:33,885
That's... not going to work.

680
00:35:33,887 --> 00:35:35,555
And it's weird.

681
00:35:35,557 --> 00:35:38,925
Why can't I just take them
to school in a Taco Bell bag?

682
00:35:38,927 --> 00:35:41,193
[clears throat]

683
00:35:41,195 --> 00:35:44,930
Because I've written articles
for <i>Server</i> magazine.

684
00:35:44,932 --> 00:35:48,501
- Do you know what that is?
- No.

685

Get the fuck out of my car.

[Paul] So the bartender says,
"No? You don't know?

You walk him

[laughter]

694
00:36:19,133 --> 00:36:21,033
Why are you wearing chaps
at dinner?

695
00:36:21,035 --> 00:36:24,070
These used to belong
to Roy Rogers.

[both imitate
bullet ricocheting]

- Please.
- [Erasmus] Even though

698
00:36:27,675 --> 00:36:29,008
I don't believe
in reincarnation,

699
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:30,876
I am becoming more
and more convinced

700
00:36:30,878 --> 00:36:33,678
that in a previous life,
I was a cattle rustler.

701
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,282
[laughter]

702
00:36:35,284 --> 00:36:37,249
You just said you don't believe
in reincarnation.

703
00:36:37,251 --> 00:36:39,619
I can rustle cattle.
I roped a steer.

704
00:36:39,621 --> 00:36:41,889
You couldn't rope Ethel Merman.

705
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:45,892
Bill, do you like the place?

706
00:36:45,894 --> 00:36:47,426
Seriously, tell them
what time you go to bed.

707
00:36:47,428 --> 00:36:48,961
- Whenever I want.
- Oh...

708
00:36:48,963 --> 00:36:52,198
I want Erasmus and Paul
to be my granddaddys.

709

- You like Erasmus's cooking?
- No, it's gross.

Where is your dad?

712
00:36:59,073 --> 00:37:00,939
He's in jail
for beating up a hooker.

Where does he get this stuff?

He's actually not kidding
about that.

Oh. Heh.

717
00:37:08,883 --> 00:37:13,122
Um, well,
where's your mom?

718
00:37:13,921 --> 00:37:15,720
She was a drug addict.

719
00:37:15,722 --> 00:37:18,226
And she took
too many drugs one night.

720
00:37:19,093 --> 00:37:21,559
And she fell off the balcony.

721
00:37:21,561 --> 00:37:24,365
It was four stories high.

722
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,807
Where were you
when this happened?

723
00:37:34,809 --> 00:37:36,979
In the next room.

724
00:37:48,856 --> 00:37:54,829
Well, the good news
is I've made a pear tart.

Hi. Hey, come...
come... come on in.

- Thank you.
- Yeah.

00:38:40,742 --> 00:38:43,276
This is the first
of several mandated visits

735

by the CPS of New Mexico.

Fantastic.

there's an inquiry
initiated by CPS.

for 10 weeks.

We're backlogged.

So is he here?

[all sigh]

00:38:59,061 --> 00:39:00,191
Who's that?

744
00:39:00,193 --> 00:39:03,729
Erasmus,
this is, uh...

745
00:39:03,731 --> 00:39:04,997
- Melissa.
- Melissa.

746
00:39:04,999 --> 00:39:07,332
From Child
Protective Services.

747
00:39:07,334 --> 00:39:08,934
Oh, shit.

748
00:39:08,936 --> 00:39:11,505
Uh, hello, Melissa,
I'm Erasmus.

749
00:39:13,073 --> 00:39:15,041
So, yeah, Bill's around.
And you haven't seen...

[whispers indistinctly]

751
00:39:16,276 --> 00:39:18,211
I don't know.
I just got up.

752
00:39:18,213 --> 00:39:20,012
Is anything wrong?

753
00:39:20,014 --> 00:39:21,347
No, Melissa.

754
00:39:21,349 --> 00:39:24,584
Welcome to our humble
country abode.

755
00:39:24,586 --> 00:39:26,785
I'll just going to put
some coffee on.

756
00:39:26,787 --> 00:39:30,256
Ooh.
It's good coffee.

757
00:39:30,258 --> 00:39:35,428
Yes, also good
if we find the child.

758
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:37,695
[indistinct cartoon noises

759
00:39:37,697 --> 00:39:39,966
Oh, here he is.

760
00:39:39,968 --> 00:39:42,938
Right where we
sometimes find him.

761
00:39:43,939 --> 00:39:45,204
Hello.

762
00:39:45,206 --> 00:39:48,576
Yeah, he likes
to be called Bill.

763
00:39:50,544 --> 00:39:52,345
So they take me to school
every morning,

764
00:39:52,347 --> 00:39:54,981
and then they pick me up
every afternoon.

765
00:39:54,983 --> 00:39:57,584
Together? They both go?

766
00:39:57,586 --> 00:40:00,986
It's usually Paul.

767
00:40:00,988 --> 00:40:03,055
No, it's always Paul.

768
00:40:03,057 --> 00:40:05,225
Has anything happened here
at home

769
00:40:05,227 --> 00:40:08,330
that frightened
or disturbed you?

770
00:40:09,396 --> 00:40:11,097
No.

771
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:13,135
Are you sure?

772
00:40:14,401 --> 00:40:15,867
Like what?

773
00:40:15,869 --> 00:40:19,540
Like any hitting or yelling?

774
00:40:20,807 --> 00:40:23,742
Mm, not really.

775
00:40:23,744 --> 00:40:25,544
Not really?

776
00:40:25,546 --> 00:40:26,611
You're not sure?

777
00:40:26,613 --> 00:40:27,946
I mean no.

778
00:40:27,948 --> 00:40:30,515
Have you seen anything
that confused you?

779
00:40:30,517 --> 00:40:36,287
Certain kinds of touching
that made you uncomfortable?

780
00:40:36,289 --> 00:40:37,323
No.

781
00:40:37,325 --> 00:40:39,158
It seems like
something happened

782
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,495
that you don't want
to talk to me about.

783
00:40:42,497 --> 00:40:44,666
But you can tell me
anything.

784
00:40:47,668 --> 00:40:49,734
Can't I just show you?

785
00:40:49,736 --> 00:40:51,271
Of course.

786
00:40:51,273 --> 00:40:55,374
Those flat shoes.
Flap, flap, flap, flap, flap.

787
00:40:55,376 --> 00:40:58,980
They're so flat,
it actually makes her shorter.

788
00:41:00,081 --> 00:41:04,483
It's not even an inch.
It's completely flat.

789
00:41:04,485 --> 00:41:05,952
[Erasmus]
Everything all right?

790
00:41:05,954 --> 00:41:09,358
Totally fine.
What a large room.

791
00:41:11,892 --> 00:41:13,526
The hell does that mean?

792
00:41:13,528 --> 00:41:15,530
I hate her.

793
00:41:16,664 --> 00:41:19,164
Excuse me...

794
00:41:19,166 --> 00:41:22,203
Would both of you
come this way, please?

795
00:41:24,139 --> 00:41:27,575
Do you think she heard us
calling her a dumb bitch?

796
00:41:31,646 --> 00:41:34,483
Hope she hasn't found
the porn. Heh.

797
00:41:36,617 --> 00:41:41,187
Yeah, I mean, most of the places
I go are really horrific.

798
00:41:41,189 --> 00:41:44,222
So when I saw this house,
I was like, "Lucky kid."

799
00:41:44,224 --> 00:41:46,158
But you can't give
a kid porno.

800
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,794
Yes, but the thing is,
they are all Paul's.

801
00:41:49,796 --> 00:41:51,564
What? No, they're not.

802
00:41:51,566 --> 00:41:52,999
Some of them.

803
00:41:53,001 --> 00:41:54,499
You know,
we keep this locked up.

804
00:41:54,501 --> 00:41:56,836
The thing about a lock is,
it has no meaning

805
00:41:56,838 --> 00:41:58,204
if there's a key in it.

806
00:41:58,206 --> 00:42:00,740
Is that Confucius? Heh.

807
00:42:00,742 --> 00:42:01,908
No, that's true.

808
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,376
I was just trying to find <i>ET.</i>

809
00:42:03,378 --> 00:42:05,010
- [Erasmus] Hey. <i>ET.</i>
- [Paul] Bill!

810
00:42:05,012 --> 00:42:08,847
- Classic Spielberg. Weaver of dreams.
- Oh.

811
00:42:08,849 --> 00:42:10,716
[Paul] I love when
his finger lights up.

812
00:42:10,718 --> 00:42:12,151
That's how you can tell
he's an alien.

813
00:42:12,153 --> 00:42:14,289
- And his face.
- And his face.

814
00:42:15,322 --> 00:42:17,491
Bill, would you give us
a moment?

815
00:42:22,095 --> 00:42:24,229
<i>Sex Wars: Phantom Ass.</i>

816
00:42:24,231 --> 00:42:25,664
It's just a phase
he was going through.

817
00:42:25,666 --> 00:42:27,767
Yeah, I'm kind of
a <i>Star Wars</i> guy.

818
00:42:27,769 --> 00:42:30,468
[mockingly groans]

819
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:31,736
<i>Bareback Mountain?</i>

820
00:42:31,738 --> 00:42:33,571
What they do is take
a recognized title

821
00:42:33,573 --> 00:42:36,341
and just give it a bit
of a cheeky twist.

822
00:42:36,343 --> 00:42:37,642
- I get it.
- [Erasmus] It's unusual in that

823
00:42:37,644 --> 00:42:41,650
the source material
is also... gay.

824
00:42:44,218 --> 00:42:46,651
<i>Buttpluggerz.</i>
We're throwing them all out.

825
00:42:46,653 --> 00:42:50,525
There's so much online.
What did I just say?

826
00:42:53,427 --> 00:42:55,961
Is it okay if I come back?

827
00:42:55,963 --> 00:42:57,162
Yes, any time.

828
00:42:57,164 --> 00:43:00,365
Great, good,
because I will be back.

829
00:43:00,367 --> 00:43:02,301
[Erasmus]
We long for you to return.

830
00:43:02,303 --> 00:43:06,104
Late mornings
generally are best.

831
00:43:06,106 --> 00:43:07,539
One last thing.

832
00:43:07,541 --> 00:43:09,575
It really feels like
you should be cooking

833
00:43:09,577 --> 00:43:12,144
something nutritious
for Bill at home,

834
00:43:12,146 --> 00:43:13,479
not just grabbing fast food,

835
00:43:13,481 --> 00:43:14,979
especially given
your line of work.

836
00:43:14,981 --> 00:43:17,182
- It's not me. It's him.
- That's great advice.

837
00:43:17,184 --> 00:43:20,889
Thank you so much
for that input.

838
00:43:22,889 --> 00:43:25,126
Have a good day.

839
00:43:27,327 --> 00:43:28,760
What a queer fish.

840
00:43:28,762 --> 00:43:30,731
Uh, <i>yeah.</i>

841
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,702
Does he have friends
outside of school?

842
00:43:36,704 --> 00:43:39,405
Uh, two of us.

843
00:43:39,407 --> 00:43:41,807
Household employees.

844
00:43:41,809 --> 00:43:42,941
Staff.

845
00:43:42,943 --> 00:43:44,544
Anyone his age?

846
00:43:44,546 --> 00:43:46,211
Uh, well, there's Tino.

847
00:43:46,213 --> 00:43:49,148
Oh, good, Tino.
How old is Tino?

848
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:50,349
[both] 24.

849
00:43:50,351 --> 00:43:53,287
No, he doesn't really.

850
00:43:54,287 --> 00:43:56,354
I would like to refer you

851
00:43:56,356 --> 00:43:59,858
to a developmental therapist
here in Santa Fe.

852
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:03,294
- Are you saying he's insane?
- No, no, no, of course not.

853
00:44:03,296 --> 00:44:05,430
But treatment
can benefit someone

854
00:44:05,432 --> 00:44:08,066
who's been living with
an unstable personality.

855
00:44:08,068 --> 00:44:09,734
Maybe I should get
some treatment.

856
00:44:09,736 --> 00:44:11,370
Of course,
if you feel that you...

857
00:44:11,372 --> 00:44:14,307
- He's joking.
- I...

858
00:44:14,309 --> 00:44:16,941
In any event,
I have a very important

859
00:44:16,943 --> 00:44:20,780
harvest-abundance episode of
my television program to record.

860
00:44:20,782 --> 00:44:22,648
So if you've nothing further
to say, I'll take my leave,

861
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:25,617
and if you could find the time
to teach him how to spell,

862
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:29,490
add and subtract,
that would suffice.

863
00:44:32,693 --> 00:44:34,260
[scoffs]

864
00:44:34,262 --> 00:44:35,961
Un-fucking-believable.

865
00:44:35,963 --> 00:44:37,997
She's just trying
to do her job, Paul.

866
00:44:37,999 --> 00:44:40,966
Not her. You, you dumb dick.

867
00:44:40,968 --> 00:44:43,570
- What?
- He <i>should</i> be making friends.

868
00:44:43,572 --> 00:44:45,070
My God, after
everything he's been...

869
00:44:45,072 --> 00:44:48,106
- What concern is it of yours?
- Excuse me?

870
00:44:48,108 --> 00:44:51,276
You've expressed how little
interest you have in him.

871
00:44:51,278 --> 00:44:52,912
Mm-hmm, and I pick him up
from school every day.

872
00:44:52,914 --> 00:44:55,648
And I appreciate your efforts,
but you made it abundantly clear

873
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:57,450
you don't want to be saddled
with the responsibility.

874
00:44:57,452 --> 00:44:59,619
Well, I am saddled
with the responsibility.

875
00:44:59,621 --> 00:45:01,519
When he first arrived
I thought, oh, I don't know

876
00:45:01,521 --> 00:45:02,921
- how we're going to handle...
- Paul...

877
00:45:02,923 --> 00:45:04,457
Can you make a mental note
of all this,

878
00:45:04,459 --> 00:45:06,425
and we can sort it out
over a smart cocktail?

879
00:45:06,427 --> 00:45:08,526
I have something
at stake here.

880
00:45:08,528 --> 00:45:10,296
- What?
- When he got here,

881
00:45:10,298 --> 00:45:12,030
I thought, oh, great,
you know what?

882
00:45:12,032 --> 00:45:13,832
I'm going to be stuck
with all the responsibility.

883
00:45:13,834 --> 00:45:16,369
And surprise,
I <i>am</i> stuck with it,

884
00:45:16,371 --> 00:45:19,070
but I will not wake up
early every day,

885
00:45:19,072 --> 00:45:21,807
wake him up, pack his lunch,
help him with his homework...

886
00:45:21,809 --> 00:45:23,575
yeah, by the way,
he has homework...

887
00:45:23,577 --> 00:45:26,144
and have you tell me
it has nothing to do with me.

888
00:45:26,146 --> 00:45:27,613
[door closes]

889
00:45:27,615 --> 00:45:30,850
You know what? I am so sick
of being this furious.

890
00:45:30,852 --> 00:45:34,753
I... I give up.

891
00:45:34,755 --> 00:45:37,256
What am I doing?
You have to tape.

892
00:45:37,258 --> 00:45:39,124
I have to stay here
and pick him up.

893
00:45:39,126 --> 00:45:40,526
No, Tino can pick him up.

894
00:45:40,528 --> 00:45:42,428
- I'll pick him up.
- Don't be a martyr.

895
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:44,633
Oh, God. This.

896
00:45:46,334 --> 00:45:48,901
This, I never imagined
for myself.

897
00:45:48,903 --> 00:45:50,436
I went to Wesleyan.

898
00:45:50,438 --> 00:45:52,704
My contemporaries
are scions of industry.

899
00:45:52,706 --> 00:45:55,941
I should be living in New York
running the Food Network,

900
00:45:55,943 --> 00:45:58,776
not sitting here
in this dusty pueblo

901
00:45:58,778 --> 00:46:00,780
babysitting the boy
from <i>The Shining.</i>

902
00:46:00,782 --> 00:46:03,249
Yeah, and I went to Oxford
and all my friends...

903
00:46:03,251 --> 00:46:05,818
You went to cooking school
in the town of Oxford.

904
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:08,019
- What's your point?
- It's a very different thing.

905
00:46:08,021 --> 00:46:09,254
What's your point?

906
00:46:09,256 --> 00:46:12,524
My friends
at <i>The Rachel Ray Show</i>

907
00:46:12,526 --> 00:46:15,626
called me again and told me

908
00:46:15,628 --> 00:46:19,366
there's still a job there
for me if I want it.

909
00:46:20,901 --> 00:46:22,570
Idle threat.

910
00:46:24,338 --> 00:46:25,704
Mm.

911
00:46:25,706 --> 00:46:28,676
- [children laughing]
- [boy] Wait up, wait up!

912
00:46:30,945 --> 00:46:33,245
Wait, what do we do best?

913
00:46:33,247 --> 00:46:35,314
Drink and argue.

914
00:46:35,316 --> 00:46:36,682
Throw parties.

915
00:46:36,684 --> 00:46:38,450
We just need to give Bill
a proper birthday.

916
00:46:38,452 --> 00:46:40,352
- It's his birthday?
- Doesn't matter.

917
00:46:40,354 --> 00:46:42,055
But we do need to freshen up
the genre.

918
00:46:42,057 --> 00:46:44,523
We need a theme,
something stunning.

919
00:46:44,525 --> 00:46:47,660
I thought we were
in the middle of a fight.

920
00:46:47,662 --> 00:46:48,797
What?

921
00:46:50,932 --> 00:46:53,032
Forget "Pin the Tail
on the Donkey."

922
00:46:53,034 --> 00:46:55,233
Try "Pinning the Tail
on Ganesh,"

923
00:46:55,235 --> 00:46:59,271
the elephant-headed Hindu deity
at your next children's party.

924
00:46:59,273 --> 00:47:01,573
I'm going to take you on a tour
of the Indian subcontinent,

925
00:47:01,575 --> 00:47:03,642
where we're going
to discover the secrets

926
00:47:03,644 --> 00:47:07,213
of tandoori lobster dogs,
saffron cupcakes,

927
00:47:07,215 --> 00:47:09,517
and tamarind ice cream.

928
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,318
This is your passage to India.

929
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:18,222
I'm a Erasmus Brumble,
and this is <i>Ideal Home.</i>

930
00:47:18,224 --> 00:47:20,494
[children chattering]

931
00:47:23,631 --> 00:47:26,733
One of the staples
of authentic Indian cuisine

932
00:47:26,735 --> 00:47:29,635
is of course naan,
the indigenous flatbread.

933
00:47:29,637 --> 00:47:31,769
But I need someone
to help me roll the dough.

934
00:47:31,771 --> 00:47:33,372
- Heather...
- My name's not Heather.

935
00:47:33,374 --> 00:47:34,939
- It's Whitney.
- That's all right.

936
00:47:34,941 --> 00:47:36,675
Bill, would you like
to help me grind

937
00:47:36,677 --> 00:47:39,311
some tamarind paste
with this pestle and mortar?

938
00:47:39,313 --> 00:47:41,180
No. Let's get Taco Bell.

939
00:47:41,182 --> 00:47:42,715
- [both] Yeah! Taco Bell!
- Cut!

940
00:47:42,717 --> 00:47:47,586
Taco Bell! Taco Bell!
Taco Bell! Taco Bell!

941
00:47:47,588 --> 00:47:51,323
[lively Indian pop music
playing over speakers]

942
00:47:51,325 --> 00:47:53,325
[Bill roars]

943
00:47:53,327 --> 00:47:55,227
- Hey.
- What?

944
00:47:55,229 --> 00:47:58,296
- Is this your party?
- Yeah.

945
00:47:58,298 --> 00:48:00,435
Do you have two dads?

946
00:48:01,401 --> 00:48:05,336
No. Well, I don't know.

947
00:48:05,338 --> 00:48:06,907
Sort of.

948
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:10,075
That's littering.

949
00:48:10,077 --> 00:48:11,343
So what?

950
00:48:11,345 --> 00:48:13,111
We don't do that here.

951
00:48:13,113 --> 00:48:16,050
[lively music continues]

952
00:48:27,394 --> 00:48:28,896
[girl] Wow!

953
00:48:31,965 --> 00:48:33,030
Wow!

954
00:48:33,032 --> 00:48:35,733
Oh, my gosh,
this has been so amazing.

955
00:48:35,735 --> 00:48:38,135
Um, Chelsea's got
a birthday next weekend.

956
00:48:38,137 --> 00:48:40,539
- [Erasmus] Mmm...
- And we would so love

957
00:48:40,541 --> 00:48:42,709
to have you guys come.

958
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:45,577
- Well, fantastic.
- Yeah?

doesn't find quite
the same sense of humor

in this situation.

1161

He... He said this aloud
in, in class?

he's learning these terms?

Um... It's... it's...
We don't make a habit

1169
01:00:44,231 --> 01:00:46,798
of using words like that,
I have to say.

1170

Um, unless it...
unless it's in context.

1171
01:00:51,537 --> 01:00:53,204
I see where he gets it.

1172
01:00:53,206 --> 01:00:54,606
[Erasmus] I hate to say this,
but I do think it's a case

1173
01:00:54,608 --> 01:00:56,108
of pot calling the kettle black?

1174
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:58,209
I did notice the word "felching"

1175
01:00:58,211 --> 01:00:59,943
on your classroom wall,

1176
01:00:59,945 --> 01:01:03,316
which I thought was highly
inappropriate in a classroom.

1177
01:01:04,084 --> 01:01:05,550
That is "felting."

1178
01:01:05,552 --> 01:01:08,720
[Paul] Oh, yeah,
that makes more sense.

1179
01:01:08,722 --> 01:01:10,888
Felching isn't
until middle school.

1180
01:01:10,890 --> 01:01:14,559
I am so not into that.
Can't speak for him.

1181
01:01:14,561 --> 01:01:16,762
- Guilty as charged.
- [cell phone buzzes]

1182
01:01:16,764 --> 01:01:21,932
- This is serious.
- Hello? Oh, yes.

1183
01:01:21,934 --> 01:01:24,604
We were wondering when we were
going to hear from you.

1184
01:01:25,604 --> 01:01:27,939
How's it going, Angel?
How you doing?

1185
01:01:27,941 --> 01:01:29,541
Tell them how
you're doing, Bill.

1186
01:01:29,543 --> 01:01:33,044
- Good.
- He likes to be called Bill.

1187
01:01:33,046 --> 01:01:36,615
Bill? Is that right?

1188
01:01:36,617 --> 01:01:39,283
Well, you know, angels were one
of your mom's favorite things.

1189
01:01:39,285 --> 01:01:41,352
So that's why
we named you Angel.

1190
01:01:41,354 --> 01:01:44,254
That's still his name legally,
of course.

1191
01:01:44,256 --> 01:01:46,624
But he's been doing great
at school.

1192
01:01:46,626 --> 01:01:50,294
Uh, a whole spate of friends,
and...

1193
01:01:50,296 --> 01:01:51,896
Would you like
to tell your father

1194
01:01:51,898 --> 01:01:53,865
about your new friends,
young man?

1195
01:01:53,867 --> 01:01:55,903
No.

1196
01:01:57,503 --> 01:02:00,104
Well, it sounds like
you're doing really good.

1197
01:02:00,106 --> 01:02:02,374
And, you know, I've been
doing really good in here.

1198
01:02:02,376 --> 01:02:05,542
I've been going to church.
I feel a lot better now.

1199
01:02:05,544 --> 01:02:07,111
I'm so clearheaded.

1200
01:02:07,113 --> 01:02:10,215
The big news is the minister's
really gone all out

1201
01:02:10,217 --> 01:02:11,682
for me to get an early release.

1202
01:02:11,684 --> 01:02:14,051
So I'm gonna be out of here
before New Year's.

1203
01:02:14,053 --> 01:02:15,787
- Bravo.
- And the church has also

1204
01:02:15,789 --> 01:02:18,088
set me up with
a sponsor in Arizona.

1205
01:02:18,090 --> 01:02:19,390
So when I do get out of here,

1206
01:02:19,392 --> 01:02:20,892
me and Angel
are gonna go to Arizona,

1207
01:02:20,894 --> 01:02:23,397
and we're gonna start working
for a minister there.

1208
01:02:24,631 --> 01:02:27,731
- Arizona?
- Yeah, that's right.

1209
01:02:27,733 --> 01:02:30,468
I think we need consider
how the boy

1210
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:33,171
has settled in
at school here in Santa Fe.

1211
01:02:33,173 --> 01:02:34,805
He has a lot of friends.

1212
01:02:34,807 --> 01:02:36,774
There's a school at the church.
He'll make new friends.

1213
01:02:36,776 --> 01:02:38,343
Well, I think, I think
we need to consider

1214
01:02:38,345 --> 01:02:41,345
- all this very carefully.
- He's my boy.

1215
01:02:41,347 --> 01:02:44,015
I thank you both
for taking care of him.

1216
01:02:44,017 --> 01:02:50,323
But there is a plan in place.
And it's a good plan.

1217
01:02:51,090 --> 01:02:53,191
What if I want to stay?

1218
01:02:53,193 --> 01:02:55,593
All is well,
and all will be well.

1219
01:02:55,595 --> 01:02:58,829
- But do I have to go?
- Okay, look.

1220
01:02:58,831 --> 01:03:00,530
If I tell you something,
will you promise

1221
01:03:00,532 --> 01:03:02,934
to remember it
for as long as you can?

1222
01:03:02,936 --> 01:03:04,838
Yeah.

1223
01:03:06,106 --> 01:03:09,543
Everything is temporary.

1224
01:03:18,084 --> 01:03:19,783
Except herpes.

1225
01:03:19,785 --> 01:03:22,555
- What's herpes?
- Paul...

to arrange permanent custody.

1228

I'm just trying to see
if I can somehow delay

the child going to him.

1230

- Merry Christmas.
- Hey, bud.

01:07:12,485 --> 01:07:15,756
Come on, you want to come
over here and give me a hug?

Attaboy.

1285

How you doing?
You okay? Oh, God.

1286
01:07:24,764 --> 01:07:26,798
- This is absurd!
- It's just the way it is!

This was never supposed
to be permanent.

Why are you doing this?!
You trying to infuriate me?!

You trying to cause as much
anguish as you possibly can?

Oh, stop it, the world
doesn't spin around you.

1291
01:07:35,874 --> 01:07:37,675
No, it spins around the boy,
and you're trying

1292
01:07:37,677 --> 01:07:40,611
to yank him away from the one
decent Christmas he's ever had

For a little boy, it does.

No, family makes Christmas.
And I'm his father.

Um, we should start a brioche.

It won't happen again.

1401

When the kid showed up,
I pretended everything was...

fine.

1403
01:13:31,930 --> 01:13:35,166

I can't.

- Paul...
- Listen to me.

You know
that if you were dying,

1406
01:13:40,238 --> 01:13:44,609
I would cut the heart
out of my chest for you.

1407
01:13:44,611 --> 01:13:47,412
I would die
so that you would live.

1408
01:13:47,414 --> 01:13:51,981
That's how much I love you.
That's how much I worship you.

1409
01:13:51,983 --> 01:13:55,118
And I think that you
actually know.

1410
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,289
You know that.

1411
01:13:58,624 --> 01:14:01,225
- And it doesn't matter to you.
- It does matter to me.

1412
01:14:01,227 --> 01:14:05,598
It doesn't matter.
And I can't stand it anymore.

No, not from her.

01:15:26,912 --> 01:15:29,182
Did you get a spray tan?

1428
01:15:30,081 --> 01:15:31,683
No.

1429
01:15:32,550 --> 01:15:37,253
Jemima, had me at
"ski in, ski out."

1430
01:15:37,255 --> 01:15:40,923
I'll be there Friday.
No, I can't come Thursday.

1431
01:15:40,925 --> 01:15:42,993
I've got to see my lawyer.

1432
01:15:42,995 --> 01:15:46,163
Oh, just stupid stuff.

1433
01:15:46,165 --> 01:15:49,266
Yeah. You can have
all these bags.

1434
01:15:49,268 --> 01:15:51,068
I don't really need them.

1435
01:15:51,070 --> 01:15:54,937
Good.
Because they're mine.

1436
01:15:54,939 --> 01:15:56,543
Oh.

1437
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:03,980
[sighs]

1438
01:16:03,982 --> 01:16:08,385
I... I think this might be
the best thing for both of us.

1439
01:16:08,387 --> 01:16:11,321
Well, we had a good run.

1440
01:16:11,323 --> 01:16:14,391
Oh, and remember to keep an eye
on the tile guy tomorrow.

1441
01:16:14,393 --> 01:16:16,493
I think
he's overbilling us.

1442
01:16:16,495 --> 01:16:17,494
[sighs]

1443
01:16:17,496 --> 01:16:19,029
I don't give a fuck
what you think

1444
01:16:19,031 --> 01:16:21,234
about the fucking tile guy,
you fucking cunt!

1445
01:16:22,401 --> 01:16:27,340
Oh. And you were
doing so well.

1446

[struggles with handle;

1447
01:17:04,242 --> 01:17:07,979
Please don't leave me.
I can't live without you.

1448
01:17:07,981 --> 01:17:09,646
Don't go.

1449
01:17:09,648 --> 01:17:12,984
Don't go, please,
please, please, please.

1450
01:17:12,986 --> 01:17:15,421
I love you.

1451
01:17:17,790 --> 01:17:21,361
I sure hope
he's not talking to me.

1452
01:17:26,999 --> 01:17:28,601

[thunder rumbling]

1460
01:21:36,814 --> 01:21:41,086
And this motion will be accepted
by the court at this time.

1461
01:21:50,963 --> 01:21:53,096
The child shall remain
in the custody

1462
01:21:53,098 --> 01:21:57,702
of Erasmus Brumble
and Paul Morgan.

1463
01:21:59,504 --> 01:22:03,239
[Erasmus]
Oh, well, I must say,

1464
01:22:03,241 --> 01:22:08,444
all that courtroom melodrama
makes a man very hungry.

1465
01:22:08,446 --> 01:22:12,181
- [Paul] How are you doing?
- [Bill] I'm hungry, too.

1466
01:22:12,183 --> 01:22:14,454
So what shall we eat?

1467
01:22:23,062 --> 01:22:25,595
[Paul] Let's not do a whole
thing tonight. I'm exhausted.

1468
01:22:25,597 --> 01:22:27,364
Why don't we just pick up
some sushi?

1469
01:22:27,366 --> 01:22:28,898
You know, supermarket sushi

1470
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:31,168
is like God shitting
on mankind.

1471
01:22:31,170 --> 01:22:32,635
It is everything that
is wrong with this country.

1472
01:22:32,637 --> 01:22:34,136
I didn't say
supermarket sushi.

1473
01:22:34,138 --> 01:22:36,004
I've never had
supermarket sushi in my life.

1474
01:22:36,006 --> 01:22:38,240
Unless it was late at night
and I was blackout drunk

1475
01:22:38,242 --> 01:22:40,510
and I don't remember,
and that probably happened.

1476
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:42,579
I could make some sushi.
I did train

1477
01:22:42,581 --> 01:22:45,716
with one of the world's
leading sushi chefs.

1478
01:22:45,718 --> 01:22:47,551
That was at a demo
at Williams-Sonoma

1479
01:22:47,553 --> 01:22:49,352
in Albuquerque.
I was with you.

1480
01:22:49,354 --> 01:22:54,490
You know, your version
of events is so pedestrian.

1481
01:22:54,492 --> 01:22:56,193
Also known as reality.

1482
01:22:56,195 --> 01:22:58,061
Blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

1483
01:22:58,063 --> 01:23:00,663
Well, why don't we just do
a pasta at home?

1484
01:23:00,665 --> 01:23:02,132
I'm trying to avoid wheat
and dairy, Paul.

1485
01:23:02,134 --> 01:23:03,699
Oh, really,
is that since you had

1486
01:23:03,701 --> 01:23:06,168
the grilled cheese sandwich
for lunch?

1487
01:23:06,170 --> 01:23:07,937
It's a constant struggle.

1488
01:23:07,939 --> 01:23:11,673
Yes, it most
certainly is.

1489
01:23:11,675 --> 01:23:13,511
- [Paul chuckles]
- Guys.

1490
01:23:13,513 --> 01:23:15,278
Why don't you ask me
what I want for dinner?

1491
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:17,413
Well, we just assumed
it was Taco Bell.

1492
01:23:17,415 --> 01:23:19,682
[Bill]
No, I still love it,

1493
01:23:19,684 --> 01:23:22,785
but I'd like
something else tonight.

1494
01:23:22,787 --> 01:23:25,154
- Really?
- What would you like?

1495
01:23:25,156 --> 01:23:27,824
I'd like to have
pork tenderloin

1496
01:23:27,826 --> 01:23:32,095
with caramelized apples
and ginger.

1497
01:23:32,097 --> 01:23:33,062
What the hell?

1498
01:23:33,064 --> 01:23:35,535
What the fuck?

1499
01:23:36,469 --> 01:23:37,801
All right.

1500
01:23:37,803 --> 01:23:39,735
Let's get this kid
a pork tenderloin.

1501
01:23:39,737 --> 01:23:44,641
Maybe some polenta.
With goat cheese.

1502
01:23:44,643 --> 01:23:48,912
Oh, my God.
We've created a monster.

1503
01:23:48,914 --> 01:23:50,913
<i>I</i> created a monster.

1504
01:23:50,915 --> 01:23:53,449
No, you <i>are</i> a monster.

1505
01:23:53,451 --> 01:23:56,886
And now I have to contend
with two of you. Good God.
