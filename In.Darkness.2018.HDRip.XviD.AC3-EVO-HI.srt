01:15:26,688 --> 01:15:32,258
Some time before the War,
I lived in a small village...

726
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:37,362
and there was a blind woman,
a Catholic woman...

727
01:15:37,364 --> 01:15:40,366
and she was married
to a Muslim man...

728

and they had a daughter...

love with that woman.

I came across her one day on
the road outside the village...

and we were friends,
so she knew me.

I led her into the forest
and I raped her...

and she had a little girl.

Catholic woman again.

I don't know any more.

Daddy, I pressed the wrong
button and my game is gone.

I thought you were going to wait
in the car like a good girl.

and then sit there
where I can see you.

815
01:22:34,047 --> 01:22:36,647
Sorry, my wife's away
on business.

816
01:22:36,649 --> 01:22:38,584
I had to pick her up
from school earlier.

817

She has bad asthma.

in the hospital.

No more lies.

823

I'm an orphan.

824
01:23:03,176 --> 01:23:05,410
Niall McKendrick adopted me.

825
01:23:05,412 --> 01:23:08,414
Not legally. He wouldn't
have been able to.

Let me tell you what I think.

827
01:23:10,618 --> 01:23:12,687
Veronique was using you,
manipulating you.

828
01:23:14,521 --> 01:23:18,389
I've looked into her background
and her father Zoran Radic...

829
01:23:18,391 --> 01:23:22,760
did a lot of very, very nasty
things during the Bosnian War.

830
01:23:22,762 --> 01:23:26,330
With no doubt that had a
marked effect on Veronique.

831
01:23:26,332 --> 01:23:29,601
He seems to like women like you.

832

833
01:23:32,172 --> 01:23:35,139
Maybe she was happy to
throw you into the pit.

834
01:23:35,141 --> 01:23:37,608
Maybe she was, what of it?

835
01:23:37,610 --> 01:23:40,611
Well, maybe you were
using Veronique...

836
01:23:40,613 --> 01:23:44,616
to get closer to her father.

837
01:23:44,618 --> 01:23:51,156
Maybe, he hurt you and your
family during the War...

838
01:23:51,158 --> 01:23:54,226
and now you want to hurt him.

839
01:23:54,228 --> 01:23:58,362
That's what I think.

840
01:23:58,364 --> 01:24:01,469
Do I look like someone
who could hurt him?

841

are wearing off.
