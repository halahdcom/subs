1
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:45,310
Lights out!

2
00:02:07,924 --> 00:02:10,291
<i>--Struggle which followed
the death of Lenin...</i>

3
00:02:10,468 --> 00:02:12,709
<i>...Joseph Stalin prevailed.</i>

4
00:02:12,887 --> 00:02:17,597
<i>Stalin was the new face
of an old idea: Marxism.</i>

5
00:02:17,767 --> 00:02:21,135
<i>While the Bolsheviks firmly established
their authority at home...</i>

6
00:02:21,855 --> 00:02:25,143
<i>...the Comintern fomented revolution
throughout the world.</i>

7
00:02:25,733 --> 00:02:27,974
<i>Communism was on the march.</i>

8
00:02:28,152 --> 00:02:30,393
<i>Stalin was in the Kremlin.</i>

9
00:02:30,572 --> 00:02:32,313
<i>But what of the common people?</i>

10
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,151
<i>What of the proletariat?</i>

11
00:02:34,325 --> 00:02:37,488
<i>Those who fought to win a new world?</i>

12
00:02:38,663 --> 00:02:40,574
<i>If we look at the history...</i>

13
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:46,494
They're frying someone, Pop.

14
00:02:46,671 --> 00:02:48,628
You're on the Hades Express, mister.

15
00:02:48,798 --> 00:02:50,209
Quiet.

16
00:02:50,383 --> 00:02:52,841
Death is nothing to celebrate.

17
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:56,174
- Don't matter who it is.
- He just died.

18
00:02:56,347 --> 00:02:58,008
His name was Wayne Fisher.

19
00:02:58,182 --> 00:03:02,426
He was <i>32</i> years old,
and he killed a lady with a hammer.

20
00:03:03,271 --> 00:03:05,888
He had a rib eye for his last meal.

21
00:03:06,065 --> 00:03:08,853
He's been on death row
at Dewbend for three years.

22
00:03:10,361 --> 00:03:14,275
- And his last words were, "Go to hell."
- How do you know that?

23
00:03:14,449 --> 00:03:15,530
It's just in my head.

24
00:03:16,826 --> 00:03:19,238
All right.
It's past your bedtime, children.

25
00:03:19,412 --> 00:03:21,449
Go brush your teeth
and go to bed, please.

26
00:03:21,623 --> 00:03:25,116
<i>And history always repeats, my friends.</i>

27
00:03:25,293 --> 00:03:28,536
<i>The ghosts of their past
will soon become our present...</i>

28
00:03:28,713 --> 00:03:31,330
<i>...if we do not confront them head-on.</i>

29
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,093
Elise, I thought I told you
to put all these toys away.

30
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:46,891
You're not listening to me.

31
00:03:47,065 --> 00:03:49,102
It wasn't me who made this mess.

32
00:03:49,275 --> 00:03:50,640
Then who was it?

33
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:57,151
Christian, shut the door, please.

34
00:04:02,497 --> 00:04:03,737
You can tell me.

35
00:04:07,335 --> 00:04:08,666
It was the little boy.

36
00:04:08,836 --> 00:04:12,329
He lived here a long time ago,
and he loves playing with our toys.

37
00:04:12,507 --> 00:04:15,169
- I swear.
- I believe you.

38
00:04:15,343 --> 00:04:16,424
I do.

39
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:21,304
You know,
you've been blessed with a gift.

40
00:04:22,016 --> 00:04:23,051
You're special.

41
00:04:23,643 --> 00:04:26,260
Some people are afraid of special people.

42
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,846
Your daddy, he's one of them.

43
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,983
He doesn't understand your gift.

44
00:04:34,988 --> 00:04:37,150
You just keep it between us
from now on, okay?

45
00:04:38,866 --> 00:04:40,356
Okay.

46
00:04:44,372 --> 00:04:46,079
It's time for bed.

47
00:04:51,004 --> 00:04:53,541
- Good night.
- Don't turn off the light, Mom.

48
00:04:57,468 --> 00:04:59,926
I'm gonna be right out there, honey.

49
00:05:00,096 --> 00:05:02,758
And if you ever get scared,
what do you do?

50
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,215
That's right.

51
00:05:05,393 --> 00:05:09,557
I gave you this,
so that if you ever get scared, you can go:

52
00:05:11,858 --> 00:05:14,566
Wherever I am, I'll come running.
But you gotta save it...

53
00:05:14,736 --> 00:05:17,899
- ...for when you really need me, okay?
- Okay.

54
00:05:20,491 --> 00:05:22,152
I love you both so much.

55
00:05:22,326 --> 00:05:24,943
- Love you too, Mommy.
- Love you, Mommy.

56
00:05:33,713 --> 00:05:36,296
<i>We see an actual atomic bombing run.</i>

57
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:39,879
<i>Heading for the target is Backseat,
code name for the ship.</i>

58
00:05:40,053 --> 00:05:41,088
<i>The radio navigator...</i>

59
00:05:42,597 --> 00:05:43,803
Hey.

60
00:05:43,973 --> 00:05:45,259
What?

61
00:05:45,433 --> 00:05:47,515
You asleep yet?

62
00:05:47,685 --> 00:05:49,267
No.

63
00:05:51,314 --> 00:05:55,228
Do you ever think about the people
who go to the electric chair?

64
00:05:56,861 --> 00:05:59,273
Sometimes.

65
00:06:01,574 --> 00:06:05,909
Do you wonder where they go
after it's done?

66
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,535
No.

67
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:10,622
I know where they go.

68
00:06:10,792 --> 00:06:12,453
Oh, yeah?

69
00:06:12,627 --> 00:06:14,117
Where?

70
00:06:16,964 --> 00:06:20,423
They go into the dark.

71
00:06:37,401 --> 00:06:39,233
Christian?

72
00:07:20,278 --> 00:07:22,144
What are you doing?

73
00:07:50,391 --> 00:07:52,098
Elise.

74
00:08:09,243 --> 00:08:11,780
You made all the mess, didn't you?

75
00:08:14,081 --> 00:08:15,412
Yes.

76
00:08:20,463 --> 00:08:22,670
Where's my whistle?

77
00:08:24,342 --> 00:08:25,924
The boy is in the closet.

78
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,336
It's okay.

79
00:08:29,513 --> 00:08:30,844
We won't hurt you.

80
00:08:32,558 --> 00:08:33,764
Come on out.

81
00:08:33,935 --> 00:08:36,176
Stop it, Elise.

82
00:08:38,105 --> 00:08:39,345
Come on out.

83
00:08:41,442 --> 00:08:43,149
I'm not in the closet.

84
00:08:51,577 --> 00:08:53,033
<i>The people took their revenge.</i>

85
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,946
Gerald. Gerald, no.

86
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,581
What have you done, Elise?

87
00:09:00,836 --> 00:09:02,952
- Put your hands on the wall.
- Leave her alone.

88
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,461
Quiet, Audrey!

89
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:13,595
Did you see a ghost?

90
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:15,427
Gerald, stop it.

91
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:17,091
Yes.

92
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:23,936
I don't want to hurt you, girl.

93
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:27,102
Just say no. That's all you have to do.

94
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,487
I'm just gonna ask you again.

95
00:09:30,324 --> 00:09:32,361
Did you see a ghost?

96
00:09:32,535 --> 00:09:33,570
Yes, I did.

97
00:09:34,662 --> 00:09:36,494
They're all around us in this house.

98
00:09:37,164 --> 00:09:39,030
They're everywhere.

99
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,242
You don't have to do this. Please.

100
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,707
She's just a little girl, Gerald. Please.

101
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,292
No. No, Daddy.

102
00:09:47,466 --> 00:09:48,581
No, no.

103
00:09:50,803 --> 00:09:52,635
No, no, no. Take me. Please take me.

104
00:09:52,805 --> 00:09:55,843
- Help me.
- Please, please, please. Gerald, stop!

105
00:09:56,017 --> 00:09:58,304
- Please, honey, she's had enough.
- Don't. Stop.

106
00:09:58,477 --> 00:09:59,842
Please don't. No.

107
00:10:00,021 --> 00:10:03,139
Don't tell me how to punish her.
I punish people for a living.

108
00:10:03,316 --> 00:10:04,477
Please!

109
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,061
Please, not in there.

110
00:10:06,235 --> 00:10:08,351
No, no, no.

111
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,146
No, Daddy!

112
00:10:11,324 --> 00:10:13,986
No. Daddy, please,
I don't wanna go in there!

113
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,197
No, not in there.

114
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:18,828
No, Daddy, please, not in there!

115
00:10:18,998 --> 00:10:21,456
Daddy, let me out! Daddy, please!

116
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,207
You can either follow my rules...

117
00:10:23,377 --> 00:10:26,586
...and sleep under my roof or you can
break them and sleep under my floor.

118
00:10:26,756 --> 00:10:28,167
Don't put me in here, Daddy.

119
00:10:28,341 --> 00:10:29,547
Daddy, please.

120
00:10:29,717 --> 00:10:33,005
Daddy, come back.
I don't wanna be in here alone.

121
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:35,386
Daddy, please!

122
00:11:58,931 --> 00:12:02,174
Are you scared of the dark?

123
00:12:02,601 --> 00:12:05,684
Who is that? Who's there?

124
00:12:10,985 --> 00:12:12,692
Don't be afraid.

125
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:15,320
I can make it light.

126
00:12:38,596 --> 00:12:39,631
Who is that?

127
00:12:40,764 --> 00:12:42,425
Why are you down here?

128
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,762
My daddy put me down here.

129
00:12:44,935 --> 00:12:48,553
Your daddy doesn't treat you right.

130
00:12:48,731 --> 00:12:50,313
Open this door.

131
00:12:50,483 --> 00:12:52,895
There'll be lots of light.

132
00:12:53,944 --> 00:12:56,276
Go on. Open it.

133
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:59,906
There's a key hanging up right there.

134
00:13:00,493 --> 00:13:02,860
Take your time. I can wait.

135
00:13:03,037 --> 00:13:06,701
You're the only one
that can open the door.

136
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,162
You are more powerful than you know.

137
00:13:10,336 --> 00:13:14,125
I want you to help me open all the doors.

138
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:33,454
<i>Don't forget what Bill the turtle just did,
everyone...</i>

139
00:14:33,627 --> 00:14:36,790
<i>...because we might have to do
the same thing.</i>

140
00:14:36,964 --> 00:14:39,456
<i>That's what this is all about, my friends.</i>

141
00:14:39,633 --> 00:14:41,294
<i>Duck and cover.</i>

142
00:14:41,844 --> 00:14:43,801
<i>This is an official civil defense film...</i>

143
00:14:43,971 --> 00:14:46,303
<i>...produced in cooperation
with the Federal Civil...</i>

144
00:14:53,188 --> 00:14:54,644
Elise?

145
00:15:01,238 --> 00:15:02,694
<i>...for the ultimate...</i>

146
00:15:15,961 --> 00:15:17,747
Elise?

147
00:15:31,852 --> 00:15:32,967
Audrey?

148
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:37,100
Audrey.

149
00:15:38,734 --> 00:15:40,395
Audrey!

150
00:15:40,569 --> 00:15:42,981
No, no, Audrey. Audrey, no.

151
00:15:43,155 --> 00:15:46,113
No. No. No.

152
00:15:48,619 --> 00:15:49,905
No, Audrey!

153
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,820
I'm sorry.

154
00:15:53,082 --> 00:15:56,416
No!

155
00:16:52,057 --> 00:16:53,673
Good morning.

156
00:16:53,851 --> 00:16:56,263
The dreams are coming back, Warren.

157
00:16:57,479 --> 00:16:59,937
Just won't go away, will it?

158
00:17:00,107 --> 00:17:03,475
How would you like breakfast in bed?

159
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:06,060
I thought so.

160
00:17:06,238 --> 00:17:10,698
- You're getting old, Warren. We both are.
- I've been studying last week's footage...

161
00:17:10,868 --> 00:17:14,327
...from the church. We missed something.
There is movement in the frame.

162
00:17:16,373 --> 00:17:17,863
- Look.
- It's a piece of lint.

163
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:21,997
- Lint doesn't walk across the room.
- Behold.

164
00:17:22,713 --> 00:17:25,455
The reason I was up all night.

165
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:28,749
The lights.

166
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:32,928
That's right, my friends.
It's voice activated.

167
00:17:33,098 --> 00:17:36,557
No more dealing with pesky switches,
having to find them in the dark...

168
00:17:36,727 --> 00:17:38,764
...straining fingers as you switch them.

169
00:17:38,937 --> 00:17:41,144
Yeah, that was a real problem before,
you know.

170
00:17:41,315 --> 00:17:43,602
Toil in the darkness of sarcasm,
my friend.

171
00:17:43,776 --> 00:17:48,361
I prefer to work in the lights.

172
00:17:52,534 --> 00:17:54,275
The lights?

173
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,827
Lights!

174
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:01,702
Bad acoustics.

175
00:18:01,877 --> 00:18:06,166
Natural light's better
for the environment anyway. Voila.

176
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,581
I love that you boys are staying
in the house.

177
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:12,502
But please don't try to fix anything else
that isn't broken.

178
00:18:16,892 --> 00:18:18,758
Spectral Sightings.

179
00:18:19,937 --> 00:18:21,177
Yes, she is.

180
00:18:21,355 --> 00:18:22,811
Elise!

181
00:18:23,774 --> 00:18:26,983
- This is Elise.
<i>- Hey there. My name is Ted Garza.</i>

182
00:18:27,152 --> 00:18:29,109
Nice to meet you, Mr. Garza.

183
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:31,816
<i>Yeah. I'm having some problems.</i>

184
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:34,106
<i>Things are happening in my house...</i>

185
00:18:34,284 --> 00:18:37,072
<i>...and they say
that you know about this stuff.</i>

186
00:18:37,246 --> 00:18:38,657
I know some things.

187
00:18:38,831 --> 00:18:42,290
<i>Yeah, well, I was wondering
if you could take a look.</i>

188
00:18:42,459 --> 00:18:47,044
<i>I need... I need help is the thing, see.</i>

189
00:18:47,214 --> 00:18:48,704
May I ask where you live?

190
00:18:48,882 --> 00:18:53,467
<i>I live at 414 Appletree Road...</i>

191
00:18:54,429 --> 00:18:56,545
<i>...Five Keys, New Mexico.</i>

192
00:19:06,358 --> 00:19:08,269
Mr. Garza...

193
00:19:08,819 --> 00:19:11,982
...I wish I could help you,
but I really can't.

194
00:19:12,155 --> 00:19:13,896
I'm so sorry.

195
00:19:14,074 --> 00:19:17,237
I thank you very much
for thinking of me.

196
00:19:42,895 --> 00:19:45,603
Sorry to drag you boys out of bed.

197
00:19:46,148 --> 00:19:49,357
That man who called today about a job...

198
00:19:52,487 --> 00:19:56,401
...he told me he lives in the house
that I grew up in.

199
00:19:57,868 --> 00:20:01,452
I call it a house because it wasn't a...
A home.

200
00:20:07,628 --> 00:20:11,713
I don't have memories from that place.
I have scars.

201
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:18,089
This gift I have
that you boys are so in awe of...

202
00:20:19,723 --> 00:20:22,465
...my father tried to beat it out of me.

203
00:20:24,645 --> 00:20:26,101
And...

204
00:20:26,647 --> 00:20:27,808
...my mother...

205
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,897
...she was killed in that house.

206
00:20:31,068 --> 00:20:35,062
She was murdered by something
that I brought into this world.

207
00:20:35,697 --> 00:20:38,940
This demon wants to use my abilities...

208
00:20:39,117 --> 00:20:41,529
...and it will hurt the ones I love
to get to me.

209
00:20:41,703 --> 00:20:44,195
That's why I never want to go
into The Further...

210
00:20:44,373 --> 00:20:46,455
...like I did for Quinn.

211
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:50,368
I have spent my life fighting
these things...

212
00:20:50,545 --> 00:20:54,288
...because I can never forget the look
on my mother's face when she died.

213
00:20:56,259 --> 00:20:57,966
So...

214
00:20:59,304 --> 00:21:01,636
...I have to help this man...

215
00:21:02,849 --> 00:21:05,762
...because I know what he's up against.

216
00:21:07,187 --> 00:21:10,475
We'll pack up the truck tonight.
We'll get an early start tomorrow.

217
00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:12,390
Not this time.

218
00:21:13,235 --> 00:21:15,772
This one, I have to do...

219
00:21:16,613 --> 00:21:18,149
...alone.

220
00:22:02,868 --> 00:22:06,862
We have to come with you now.
This cost us 700 bucks.

221
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,997
Plus 200 for the logo paint job.

222
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,345
Before we go inside...

223
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:54,886
...I brought some clothes for you boys.

224
00:23:56,606 --> 00:24:00,725
Some of it belonged to Jack,
and it's very important to me.

225
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:05,612
I bet I can guess who you are.

226
00:24:05,782 --> 00:24:07,989
There's no need. I'm Elise.

227
00:24:08,577 --> 00:24:10,284
- Hi.
- And this is Specs and Tucker...

228
00:24:10,453 --> 00:24:11,784
...my associates.

229
00:24:11,955 --> 00:24:13,787
She's psychic.

230
00:24:13,957 --> 00:24:16,073
We're sidekick.

231
00:24:16,543 --> 00:24:17,999
What was that?

232
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:21,162
She's psychic. We're sidekick.

233
00:24:22,716 --> 00:24:26,209
- Sorry, I'm... I'm not understanding.
- Yeah, never mind.

234
00:24:27,387 --> 00:24:29,253
You wanna come in? Here.

235
00:24:29,431 --> 00:24:32,093
Come on. I'm supposed
to invite you in. Come on.

236
00:24:32,767 --> 00:24:34,349
Hello.

237
00:24:44,112 --> 00:24:45,398
<i>--Aggression.</i>

238
00:24:45,572 --> 00:24:48,564
<i>And history always repeats, my friends.</i>

239
00:24:48,742 --> 00:24:52,076
<i>The ghosts of their past
will soon become our present...</i>

240
00:24:52,245 --> 00:24:53,861
<i>...if we do not confront them...</i>

241
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:56,076
You still have so much of our old stuff.

242
00:24:56,249 --> 00:24:58,206
It was all here.

243
00:24:59,419 --> 00:25:01,626
Pretty good stuff, you know?

244
00:25:01,796 --> 00:25:03,878
I didn't see any reason to get rid of it.

245
00:25:04,549 --> 00:25:06,586
There's stories.

246
00:25:07,761 --> 00:25:09,172
About your family.

247
00:25:09,346 --> 00:25:11,963
I never listened to them
when they said that...

248
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,472
...this wasn't a place that I should live.

249
00:25:14,643 --> 00:25:17,601
You know, I looked at it,
and I just saw a little house.

250
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,018
I said, "Screw the stories,"
and I bought it.

251
00:25:26,071 --> 00:25:27,857
Now I believe the stories.

252
00:25:33,662 --> 00:25:35,448
You getting anything?

253
00:25:36,206 --> 00:25:39,824
There are so many spirits,
it's hard to tell the good from the evil.

254
00:25:40,001 --> 00:25:42,834
A lot of people died in that prison.

255
00:25:43,004 --> 00:25:44,790
When did these occurrences start?

256
00:25:44,965 --> 00:25:47,332
Soon after I moved in.

257
00:25:50,595 --> 00:25:52,677
First, it was...

258
00:25:52,847 --> 00:25:54,929
...the little things, you know?

259
00:25:55,392 --> 00:25:56,757
Things that...

260
00:26:00,563 --> 00:26:03,351
<i>You've been blessed with a gift.</i>

261
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:22,120
<i>You're special.</i>

262
00:26:22,544 --> 00:26:25,536
<i>You just keep it between us
from now on, okay?</i>

263
00:26:26,423 --> 00:26:29,165
<i>No. No!</i>

264
00:26:31,803 --> 00:26:33,134
You okay?

265
00:26:36,641 --> 00:26:39,133
Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.

266
00:26:40,061 --> 00:26:42,223
These experiences you're having...

267
00:26:42,397 --> 00:26:44,104
...where do they mainly occur?

268
00:26:46,067 --> 00:26:48,399
Mostly in one room.

269
00:26:49,946 --> 00:26:51,778
I keep it locked now.

270
00:26:51,948 --> 00:26:54,736
I haven't opened it in three months.

271
00:26:59,748 --> 00:27:01,580
I'll take that one.

272
00:27:02,042 --> 00:27:03,908
You wanna give me a hand?

273
00:27:05,503 --> 00:27:07,085
That's good.

274
00:27:09,257 --> 00:27:10,998
A little bit more.

275
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,486
Sorry.

276
00:27:40,663 --> 00:27:42,574
Can't go in there.

277
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,797
When it first started...

278
00:27:56,679 --> 00:28:00,388
...I could hear somebody
just walking back and forth.

279
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:04,218
Someone was talking to themselves.

280
00:28:15,073 --> 00:28:17,906
You think you're going crazy,
and then you...

281
00:28:18,076 --> 00:28:20,363
You actually hear it.

282
00:28:22,831 --> 00:28:24,617
And you know you're not.

283
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:27,916
Finally, one day, I walked in...

284
00:28:28,086 --> 00:28:30,202
...and I screamed at it:

285
00:28:30,672 --> 00:28:32,458
"You stop."

286
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,382
"You stop.

287
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,881
Please stop."

288
00:28:41,015 --> 00:28:43,552
My whole life savings is in this place.

289
00:28:43,726 --> 00:28:45,308
You gotta help me.

290
00:28:45,478 --> 00:28:47,139
You gotta help me, please.

291
00:28:47,897 --> 00:28:49,979
That's what we do.

292
00:28:53,695 --> 00:28:57,313
The camera is so we can see
what she sees from out in the truck.

293
00:28:58,491 --> 00:29:01,233
We call it the "Winneba-ghost."

294
00:29:06,332 --> 00:29:09,199
I think I'm gonna go there now.

295
00:29:20,388 --> 00:29:22,675
You really are gonna stay here all alone?

296
00:29:22,849 --> 00:29:28,390
My presence tends to draw the spirits
out of their dark, little corners.

297
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,602
You need to take this.

298
00:29:34,277 --> 00:29:35,893
Thank you.

299
00:29:37,197 --> 00:29:38,312
Good night.

300
00:30:00,345 --> 00:30:02,256
Can you hear us, Elise?

301
00:30:03,806 --> 00:30:07,800
Yes. Try not to drown out
the other voices.

302
00:30:08,478 --> 00:30:10,389
<i>We got you. We gone.</i>

303
00:30:12,148 --> 00:30:13,309
Here you go.

304
00:30:14,609 --> 00:30:16,600
- What's this?
- Lights.

305
00:30:18,071 --> 00:30:19,436
Thanks.

306
00:31:39,736 --> 00:31:42,228
I thought you were gone forever.

307
00:31:44,782 --> 00:31:46,489
<i>My mother got this for my brother...</i>

308
00:31:46,659 --> 00:31:49,947
...and he lost it
when he was 6 years old.

309
00:31:59,589 --> 00:32:01,375
Safe now.

310
00:34:19,145 --> 00:34:20,431
- Stop.
- What?

311
00:34:20,605 --> 00:34:21,936
Go back, to the left.

312
00:34:25,443 --> 00:34:27,730
- What?
- Yeah, nothing.

313
00:34:27,904 --> 00:34:29,895
Thought I saw some feet.

314
00:34:30,072 --> 00:34:31,233
Feet?

315
00:34:56,682 --> 00:34:59,720
Elise, there's someone
right in front of you.

316
00:35:01,646 --> 00:35:03,262
<i>Looks like a woman.</i>

317
00:35:03,439 --> 00:35:04,975
I don't see anything.

318
00:35:05,983 --> 00:35:08,771
<i>Elise, be careful.</i>

319
00:35:14,742 --> 00:35:17,029
I don't see what you're seeing.

320
00:35:19,247 --> 00:35:22,581
<i>You're going to touch it.</i>

321
00:35:23,751 --> 00:35:24,751
Be careful.

322
00:35:29,131 --> 00:35:30,337
Help her.

323
00:35:34,971 --> 00:35:38,009
Elise? Elise? What happened?

324
00:35:39,267 --> 00:35:40,757
The whistle.

325
00:35:40,935 --> 00:35:42,972
It took the whistle.

326
00:35:43,145 --> 00:35:45,477
What were you doing in there?

327
00:35:45,648 --> 00:35:48,310
Thought you were gonna stay
in the bedroom.

328
00:35:48,484 --> 00:35:50,316
Something led me down there.

329
00:35:50,486 --> 00:35:52,318
The spirit of a woman.

330
00:35:52,738 --> 00:35:56,823
I don't know why she said, "Help her,"
but it's a ghost I have seen before...

331
00:35:57,326 --> 00:35:58,942
...in this house.

332
00:36:00,663 --> 00:36:03,496
When I was 16 years old.

333
00:36:25,688 --> 00:36:27,520
Did you hear that?

334
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:28,851
Hear what?

335
00:36:29,025 --> 00:36:31,642
There's someone in the laundry room.

336
00:36:31,819 --> 00:36:33,309
No, there isn't.

337
00:36:34,071 --> 00:36:35,527
I heard it.

338
00:36:35,698 --> 00:36:37,029
I'm gonna go look.

339
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:39,782
No. Don't, Elise.

340
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,536
Hello.

341
00:36:49,337 --> 00:36:51,248
I live here with my brother, Christian.

342
00:36:51,422 --> 00:36:53,914
- What's your name?
- Stop it.

343
00:36:54,342 --> 00:36:55,958
You're making it up.

344
00:36:56,969 --> 00:37:00,303
Come out and see my brother.
He doesn't believe that you're here.

345
00:37:00,473 --> 00:37:01,963
Christian!

346
00:37:08,564 --> 00:37:10,305
What are you doing, girl?

347
00:37:10,733 --> 00:37:13,020
There's someone in the laundry.

348
00:37:23,537 --> 00:37:24,743
There's no one in here.

349
00:37:28,417 --> 00:37:30,033
You're doing it again.

350
00:37:32,922 --> 00:37:36,711
You can't punish me for this.
I never wanted it. I never asked for it.

351
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,257
If there's one thing...

352
00:37:41,889 --> 00:37:44,881
...you've been doing
your whole life, Elise...

353
00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:46,299
...it's ask for it.

354
00:37:57,905 --> 00:38:00,863
I won't let you hurt me anymore.

355
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:06,194
Please!

356
00:38:06,872 --> 00:38:08,704
Elise.

357
00:38:09,917 --> 00:38:11,373
Elise!

358
00:38:14,714 --> 00:38:16,330
Elise, don't go!

359
00:38:18,551 --> 00:38:22,010
Leave her be. Leave her be.

360
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:27,095
She needs to learn that nobody else
can possibly love someone like her.

361
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:38,648
I haven't been back here since.

362
00:38:45,411 --> 00:38:47,994
I think that's all for tonight.

363
00:38:48,164 --> 00:38:50,030
We'll pick it up tomorrow.

364
00:38:54,503 --> 00:38:57,495
Christian and I came here a lot as kids.

365
00:38:57,965 --> 00:38:59,831
Do I look okay?

366
00:39:00,009 --> 00:39:01,716
Yeah, of course.

367
00:39:12,271 --> 00:39:13,761
All right.

368
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,440
I'm sorry. I...

369
00:39:25,618 --> 00:39:28,155
You just look so much
like someone I know very well.

370
00:39:28,329 --> 00:39:29,945
Oh, really?

371
00:39:30,873 --> 00:39:31,908
I'm Elise.

372
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:33,198
Melissa.

373
00:39:33,375 --> 00:39:34,536
Imogen.

374
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:37,418
- And you're sisters.
- Yes, we are.

375
00:39:37,588 --> 00:39:39,204
Tucker.

376
00:39:39,381 --> 00:39:40,917
Specs.

377
00:39:41,592 --> 00:39:43,458
I'm Specs. Or Steven.

378
00:39:43,636 --> 00:39:44,876
Whatever. Your choice.

379
00:39:45,054 --> 00:39:47,216
She's psychic, and we're sidekick.

380
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:49,130
I'm sorry?

381
00:39:50,351 --> 00:39:51,807
Forget it.

382
00:39:51,977 --> 00:39:54,765
- So are you guys visiting the area?
- Tough to talk about.

383
00:39:54,939 --> 00:39:57,806
Actually, it's pretty <i>confidencial.</i>

384
00:39:57,983 --> 00:40:00,771
It's a poltergeist infestation
involving Ted Garza.

385
00:40:00,945 --> 00:40:03,482
Do you know him?
He lives, like, down the road or...?

386
00:40:03,656 --> 00:40:06,114
Ghosts and ghouls.

387
00:40:06,283 --> 00:40:08,445
What he's trying to say
is we're ghost hunters.

388
00:40:08,619 --> 00:40:10,326
The three of us.

389
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:12,032
Kind of like cops.

390
00:40:12,206 --> 00:40:14,197
Only we don't arrest humans.

391
00:40:15,918 --> 00:40:17,955
I'm funny too. A lot of the time.

392
00:40:18,129 --> 00:40:20,166
- I can also be funny. What?
- Okay. Okay.

393
00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:22,501
- I think that that's enough, boys.
- Oh, yeah?

394
00:40:24,009 --> 00:40:27,422
I used to live in this town
a long time ago.

395
00:40:27,596 --> 00:40:29,803
Well, good for you. You got out.

396
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:33,842
I'm really making a fool out of myself.
We're making...

397
00:40:34,019 --> 00:40:35,509
No, you're not.

398
00:40:35,688 --> 00:40:38,305
It's really nice to meet you.

399
00:40:38,482 --> 00:40:41,190
- Ernie, how's it hanging?
- Dad, over here.

400
00:40:42,027 --> 00:40:43,938
- How are you?
- Hot enough for you?

401
00:40:54,874 --> 00:40:56,160
Hello, Christian.

402
00:40:57,793 --> 00:40:59,283
Have I aged that much?

403
00:41:03,716 --> 00:41:06,299
Well, aren't you gonna say anything?

404
00:41:06,468 --> 00:41:08,004
I have nothing to say to you.

405
00:41:08,179 --> 00:41:09,544
Girls, come on. Let's go.

406
00:41:09,722 --> 00:41:11,008
- Come on.
- We just got here.

407
00:41:11,182 --> 00:41:13,093
Hear me out.

408
00:41:13,267 --> 00:41:16,100
I'm... I'm still your sister, and...

409
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:20,309
That only means something if I choose it
to mean something, and I choose it not to.

410
00:41:20,482 --> 00:41:21,938
Please, Christian.

411
00:41:22,109 --> 00:41:25,318
I just want you to hear my piece.
I didn't know how this was gonna go.

412
00:41:25,487 --> 00:41:28,275
- I thought you could see the future.
- Is this your sister?

413
00:41:28,449 --> 00:41:30,907
- No, it isn't! Come on.
- Yes, yes, I am his sister.

414
00:41:31,076 --> 00:41:32,441
Listen to me. You listen.

415
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:36,830
Now, when we were children,
you terrified me.

416
00:41:36,999 --> 00:41:39,661
You scared the life out of me...

417
00:41:39,835 --> 00:41:42,668
...with stories about a monster
behind a red door...

418
00:41:42,838 --> 00:41:45,751
...and then you opened the door
and you left.

419
00:41:45,925 --> 00:41:47,507
You left me.

420
00:41:47,676 --> 00:41:50,885
You abandoned me to a real monster,
our father.

421
00:41:51,847 --> 00:41:56,432
Look, I wish you no harm,
but you stay away from us, Elise.

422
00:41:56,602 --> 00:41:58,309
You stay away.

423
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,970
Christian.

424
00:42:08,155 --> 00:42:11,819
Christian!

425
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:21,537
I was stupid to come back here.

426
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:23,701
No, you weren't. You're helping people.

427
00:42:23,879 --> 00:42:25,711
That's what you do, remember?

428
00:42:25,881 --> 00:42:27,588
Elise.

429
00:42:27,758 --> 00:42:29,499
I'm sorry.

430
00:42:29,677 --> 00:42:32,214
He can be unreasonable sometimes.

431
00:42:32,638 --> 00:42:35,972
Knowing what he grew up with,
that's perfectly understandable.

432
00:42:36,141 --> 00:42:38,473
He's never told us anything
about his childhood.

433
00:42:39,103 --> 00:42:40,685
I've never even seen a picture.

434
00:42:40,854 --> 00:42:43,846
He never told us anything about you.

435
00:42:44,733 --> 00:42:49,148
I left him alone, and I shouldn't have.

436
00:42:49,321 --> 00:42:52,154
He is a great dad, you know?

437
00:42:52,324 --> 00:42:54,031
I love him a lot.

438
00:42:54,201 --> 00:42:57,364
You have no idea how happy
that makes me, honey.

439
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,866
- Tucker?
- Share with me. Yes?

440
00:43:04,044 --> 00:43:06,160
Do you have the still frames
that we printed?

441
00:43:06,338 --> 00:43:08,124
- Yes, I do.
- Bring them here.

442
00:43:08,299 --> 00:43:11,462
- Eaten by the female, that's why I don't...
- Tucker?

443
00:43:11,635 --> 00:43:13,467
- Tucker, I need you.
- Yes.

444
00:43:13,971 --> 00:43:15,461
Come on.

445
00:43:22,688 --> 00:43:24,144
Here you go.

446
00:43:24,315 --> 00:43:27,433
Here. You give this to your dad...

447
00:43:27,609 --> 00:43:30,943
...and you tell him it was taken yesterday
in our old bedroom.

448
00:43:31,113 --> 00:43:34,196
Oh, I think he will be
very surprised to see it.

449
00:43:36,076 --> 00:43:38,659
I'm so happy to meet you.

450
00:43:43,042 --> 00:43:44,453
Okay.

451
00:43:54,803 --> 00:43:56,214
Testing. One, two.

452
00:43:56,388 --> 00:43:58,254
Can you hear me, guys?

453
00:43:59,183 --> 00:44:02,141
- No.
- I noticed this last night...

454
00:44:02,895 --> 00:44:05,102
...but I couldn't quite place it.

455
00:44:05,272 --> 00:44:08,810
Then Christian reminded me
that when I was a child...

456
00:44:08,984 --> 00:44:11,476
...I saw a red door.

457
00:44:11,653 --> 00:44:15,237
The entity that killed my mother
came through it.

458
00:44:17,368 --> 00:44:21,362
I don't get it. A red door is a red door.
Anyone can see it.

459
00:44:21,538 --> 00:44:23,779
No, it's not a literal door.
It's a metaphysical one.

460
00:44:23,957 --> 00:44:27,325
Remember when I went into The Further
to find Quinn Brenner?

461
00:44:27,503 --> 00:44:29,619
I came across a red door.

462
00:44:30,756 --> 00:44:36,377
<i>And I... I passed through it,
and it took me deeper into The Further.</i>

463
00:44:36,553 --> 00:44:39,045
If I can find out what it means...

464
00:44:41,183 --> 00:44:44,926
...I might be able to stop the thing
that's haunting this house.

465
00:44:45,104 --> 00:44:47,345
Well, this might help.

466
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:57,568
I spoke to you last night.

467
00:45:00,035 --> 00:45:02,948
Are you there? Can you hear me?

468
00:45:09,461 --> 00:45:12,123
You took something from me.

469
00:45:12,297 --> 00:45:13,913
Why?

470
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,132
<i>Why did you say, "Help her"?</i>

471
00:45:17,302 --> 00:45:18,633
<i>Help who?</i>

472
00:45:56,091 --> 00:45:57,547
This way.

473
00:47:54,459 --> 00:47:56,166
Is that you?

474
00:47:59,047 --> 00:48:01,789
Whistle once for yes, twice for no.

475
00:48:01,967 --> 00:48:05,050
Are you the woman I saw last night?

476
00:48:10,267 --> 00:48:13,055
Is there an entity in this house...

477
00:48:13,228 --> 00:48:16,095
...that is trying to hurt Ted Garza?

478
00:48:20,485 --> 00:48:22,817
Are you that entity?

479
00:48:29,328 --> 00:48:32,286
Is there something
you're trying to show me?

480
00:48:37,252 --> 00:48:39,744
Is what you want to show me...

481
00:48:39,921 --> 00:48:42,162
...behind this wall?

482
00:49:24,174 --> 00:49:25,255
Keys.

483
00:49:35,477 --> 00:49:38,265
Freeze, buddy. Freeze.

484
00:49:39,189 --> 00:49:40,645
On.

485
00:49:40,816 --> 00:49:42,227
Wait. On.

486
00:50:43,628 --> 00:50:45,039
Wait.

487
00:50:52,971 --> 00:50:54,632
Thank you.

488
00:51:26,797 --> 00:51:29,038
What is it you wanna show me?

489
00:52:11,007 --> 00:52:12,168
Help her!

490
00:52:35,407 --> 00:52:37,398
Help me.

491
00:52:43,707 --> 00:52:45,664
That's not a ghost.

492
00:52:45,834 --> 00:52:48,166
Oh, my God.

493
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:52,712
Oh, my God.

494
00:52:52,883 --> 00:52:54,373
I'll break the chain.

495
00:52:54,551 --> 00:52:55,837
No, you won't.

496
00:52:59,097 --> 00:53:00,428
Move.

497
00:53:01,057 --> 00:53:02,092
Get away from her!

498
00:53:02,642 --> 00:53:06,010
I asked you, help me get rid of the ghost.

499
00:53:06,187 --> 00:53:07,973
Help me get rid of it!

500
00:53:08,148 --> 00:53:09,855
<i>Help me!</i>

501
00:53:11,234 --> 00:53:14,352
Why did you have to come down here?

502
00:53:16,823 --> 00:53:20,157
- Why?!
- Your ghost led us down here.

503
00:53:20,327 --> 00:53:22,568
He's in my head.

504
00:53:24,623 --> 00:53:25,954
He's in my head.

505
00:53:44,309 --> 00:53:46,471
Is that your friend?

506
00:53:47,812 --> 00:53:49,928
That is your friend.

507
00:54:40,907 --> 00:54:43,194
You there, Specs?

508
00:54:50,375 --> 00:54:52,082
Specs!

509
00:54:58,133 --> 00:54:59,373
What?

510
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:10,990
Her name is Mara Jennings.

511
00:56:11,164 --> 00:56:13,997
She's a nurse from a town
about 10 miles outside of here.

512
00:56:14,167 --> 00:56:16,534
She's been missing
for approximately four months.

513
00:56:18,838 --> 00:56:20,294
Watch your step down.

514
00:56:23,259 --> 00:56:26,968
- Can you stick around for a few days?
- Yeah, we'll be here.

515
00:56:27,138 --> 00:56:29,505
I'm gonna have to get statements
from all of you.

516
00:56:39,442 --> 00:56:42,980
There are plenty of demons in this world
who are very much alive...

517
00:56:43,404 --> 00:56:45,816
...and you stopped one of them.

518
00:56:48,993 --> 00:56:51,530
Thanks, Elise.

519
00:57:33,705 --> 00:57:35,446
Dad, this is crazy.

520
00:57:35,623 --> 00:57:38,240
This is something I have to do.

521
00:57:46,968 --> 00:57:48,049
<i>I gotta find it.</i>

522
00:57:48,595 --> 00:57:52,008
It's a little whistle,
a little silver whistle.

523
00:57:52,182 --> 00:57:55,971
Look, I deal in the spirit world...

524
00:57:56,144 --> 00:58:01,059
...and spirits can make people
do bad things in the real world.

525
00:58:01,232 --> 00:58:04,850
Some of these people come to me
for help.

526
00:58:05,778 --> 00:58:07,519
But to you, that's weird.

527
00:58:07,697 --> 00:58:10,530
To me, it's a day job.

528
00:58:13,912 --> 00:58:15,744
This one was different though.

529
00:58:17,332 --> 00:58:20,324
The haunted house was my house.

530
00:58:23,254 --> 00:58:24,915
It's not in here.

531
00:58:26,049 --> 00:58:28,086
Hey, I'm gonna check on him.

532
00:58:29,344 --> 00:58:31,585
Why would Garza invite you up...

533
00:58:31,763 --> 00:58:35,131
...knowing the risk
that you might discover Mara?

534
00:58:40,813 --> 00:58:45,273
These hauntings can be terrifying things.

535
00:58:46,653 --> 00:58:49,395
Maybe the fear of the beyond...

536
00:58:49,572 --> 00:58:52,940
...overcame the fear of getting caught.

537
00:58:53,493 --> 00:58:55,234
Or maybe he wanted to get caught.

538
00:58:59,874 --> 00:59:01,456
What? What is it?

539
00:59:02,835 --> 00:59:04,417
I'm sorry.

540
00:59:04,587 --> 00:59:07,295
I'm seeing things.

541
00:59:07,799 --> 00:59:10,006
The shock of the whole thing, I suppose.

542
00:59:10,176 --> 00:59:12,213
Do you need me for anything else?

543
00:59:12,387 --> 00:59:13,718
No.

544
00:59:13,888 --> 00:59:15,378
Thank you.

545
00:59:24,565 --> 00:59:26,181
Melissa?

546
00:59:27,610 --> 00:59:28,896
Dad?

547
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:32,062
Down here, honey. I found the whistle.

548
00:59:55,471 --> 00:59:56,836
Dad?

549
01:02:24,287 --> 01:02:26,824
- What are you doing here?
- You can't find her, can you?

550
01:02:26,998 --> 01:02:29,660
What happened to her? Where is she?

551
01:02:29,834 --> 01:02:31,916
- We've looked everywhere.
- Not everywhere.

552
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:51,307
Oh, God, no.

553
01:02:55,026 --> 01:02:56,937
Imogen, call an ambulance.

554
01:02:57,111 --> 01:02:58,601
Now!

555
01:03:13,419 --> 01:03:16,036
How did you know where she was?

556
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:18,796
What happened to her?

557
01:03:19,175 --> 01:03:22,213
There's something evil in that house...

558
01:03:22,386 --> 01:03:24,218
...and I let it into this world.

559
01:03:24,388 --> 01:03:26,629
I think it made Ted Garza do
what he did...

560
01:03:26,807 --> 01:03:29,765
...and it's taken your sister's spirit,
and I'm gonna find it...

561
01:03:29,936 --> 01:03:31,802
...and I'm gonna finish it tonight.

562
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:35,896
I can see things too.

563
01:03:47,828 --> 01:03:50,160
When I was a little girl...

564
01:03:50,665 --> 01:03:53,453
...I went to sleep
and floated out of my bedroom...

565
01:03:53,918 --> 01:03:56,410
...all the way
to our elderly neighbor's house.

566
01:03:56,587 --> 01:04:00,626
Then she told me she was leaving
this world and going on to the next.

567
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:04,259
My dad told me
she had died the night before.

568
01:04:04,428 --> 01:04:06,886
I told him I already knew.

569
01:04:07,723 --> 01:04:11,682
- He wasn't too happy to hear that.
- Imogen, let's go.

570
01:04:11,852 --> 01:04:13,058
Come on, honey.

571
01:04:13,229 --> 01:04:15,937
No, I... I'm staying.

572
01:04:16,399 --> 01:04:19,061
Just trust me, okay?

573
01:04:21,487 --> 01:04:25,355
Come on, boys, let's get our things
and get in the house and get started.

574
01:04:27,451 --> 01:04:28,941
Son of a...

575
01:04:31,205 --> 01:04:35,164
I am going to get the attention
of all the spirits in this house.

576
01:04:35,334 --> 01:04:37,416
I need things
that were important to Garza.

577
01:04:37,587 --> 01:04:39,578
Specs, go upstairs.

578
01:04:39,755 --> 01:04:42,213
There is a Bible he held very dear to him.

579
01:04:42,383 --> 01:04:46,342
It was a red King James version,
and I need you to find it.

580
01:04:46,512 --> 01:04:48,378
- Take Imogen with you.
- Okay.

581
01:04:48,556 --> 01:04:50,638
- Do not let her out of your sight.
- I won't.

582
01:04:51,142 --> 01:04:53,634
Tucker and I are going down
to the fallout shelter.

583
01:04:53,811 --> 01:04:57,020
I get the death chamber,
he gets Bible camp with a beautiful girl?

584
01:04:57,189 --> 01:04:58,304
That's not a democracy.

585
01:04:58,482 --> 01:05:01,600
You're the only one I trust
to go down there with me.

586
01:05:02,445 --> 01:05:04,732
Don't patronize me, woman.

587
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:08,653
So why do you guys dress like that?

588
01:05:10,703 --> 01:05:13,536
It was Elise's idea. She dressed us.

589
01:05:14,832 --> 01:05:18,450
No, my usual style's a lot more laid back.

590
01:05:18,628 --> 01:05:20,118
It's a little weird.

591
01:05:21,047 --> 01:05:22,788
- What?
- Dude.

592
01:05:26,636 --> 01:05:28,752
This is vintage. No, this is worth a lot.

593
01:05:28,929 --> 01:05:31,671
I'm serious. We gotta find this thing.

594
01:05:31,849 --> 01:05:33,180
I'm just saying.

595
01:05:33,351 --> 01:05:35,058
- Gotta have hobbies.
- I'm saying.

596
01:05:35,227 --> 01:05:39,221
Can't all be work. Gotta enjoy yourself,
go out on a date.

597
01:05:42,109 --> 01:05:44,271
You gotta do stuff like that.

598
01:05:44,445 --> 01:05:45,935
There's something here.

599
01:05:47,490 --> 01:05:49,481
I can feel it.

600
01:05:52,995 --> 01:05:54,861
She wants me to have it.

601
01:05:57,708 --> 01:05:59,039
Oh, that should do it.

602
01:05:59,210 --> 01:06:01,372
- Step aside.
- Yes, sir.

603
01:06:45,673 --> 01:06:47,710
It's time to sleep.

604
01:07:00,354 --> 01:07:02,595
I know this slip.

605
01:07:02,773 --> 01:07:05,435
- This will help you sleep.
- Don't make me drink anymore.

606
01:07:05,609 --> 01:07:08,067
Please, let me go. I beg you.

607
01:07:08,821 --> 01:07:09,982
There you go.

608
01:07:11,574 --> 01:07:13,611
Please, let me go.

609
01:07:13,784 --> 01:07:16,367
I promise I won't tell.

610
01:07:16,537 --> 01:07:18,744
Please, let me...

611
01:07:50,988 --> 01:07:52,319
Did you hear that?

612
01:07:52,490 --> 01:07:54,401
Hear what?

613
01:07:59,079 --> 01:08:01,992
- My brother doesn't believe you're here.
- Christian!

614
01:08:04,835 --> 01:08:06,542
There's someone in the laundry.

615
01:08:17,973 --> 01:08:20,055
There's no one here.

616
01:08:21,018 --> 01:08:23,806
You can't punish me for this.
I never wanted it.

617
01:08:42,665 --> 01:08:43,700
Goodbye, Anna.

618
01:08:52,591 --> 01:08:54,753
She wasn't dead.

619
01:08:57,429 --> 01:09:00,672
My father did the exact same thing
that Garza did.

620
01:09:01,517 --> 01:09:04,509
The woman I saw in this house
all those years ago...

621
01:09:05,354 --> 01:09:07,470
...she was alive.

622
01:09:11,068 --> 01:09:13,184
I could have helped her.

623
01:09:15,030 --> 01:09:16,862
I let him kill her.

624
01:10:20,304 --> 01:10:22,466
Take this thing off.

625
01:10:23,432 --> 01:10:24,797
Okay.

626
01:10:50,876 --> 01:10:52,207
Her death was my fault.

627
01:10:54,171 --> 01:10:57,380
Until I free her from
wherever he put her...

628
01:10:58,092 --> 01:11:00,379
...she's trapped in the dark.

629
01:11:01,595 --> 01:11:03,177
Lost.

630
01:11:04,348 --> 01:11:05,383
I'm going in there.

631
01:11:06,558 --> 01:11:07,923
Stand back.

632
01:11:13,774 --> 01:11:15,606
Go for it.

633
01:11:15,776 --> 01:11:17,392
I'm good.

634
01:12:08,871 --> 01:12:10,703
I'm sorry, Anna.

635
01:12:13,917 --> 01:12:15,407
I failed you.

636
01:13:03,092 --> 01:13:05,754
Oh, my God.

637
01:13:12,893 --> 01:13:14,099
Where you going?

638
01:13:14,603 --> 01:13:15,934
Elise.

639
01:13:17,147 --> 01:13:18,262
Elise.

640
01:13:38,877 --> 01:13:40,367
Elise.

641
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:46,002
You weren't the only one, Anna.

642
01:15:10,385 --> 01:15:12,342
- Audrey!
- Elise?

643
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,301
<i>Audrey.</i>

644
01:15:18,101 --> 01:15:19,307
<i>Audrey.</i>

645
01:15:19,478 --> 01:15:21,060
Elise.

646
01:15:21,772 --> 01:15:23,558
Where am I?

647
01:15:24,066 --> 01:15:26,649
You're in a special place...

648
01:15:27,361 --> 01:15:29,193
...where the spirits go.

649
01:15:29,363 --> 01:15:31,195
Who are you?

650
01:15:33,367 --> 01:15:36,155
I'm a friend.

651
01:15:37,329 --> 01:15:38,865
I don't wanna be here.

652
01:15:39,039 --> 01:15:40,996
I don't wanna go where the spirits go.

653
01:15:46,421 --> 01:15:47,502
Elise...

654
01:15:48,757 --> 01:15:51,340
...no matter what your daddy says...

655
01:15:51,510 --> 01:15:54,844
...you have to go on doing what you do.

656
01:15:55,514 --> 01:15:59,098
Never be afraid of your ability.

657
01:16:03,981 --> 01:16:07,019
Daddy doesn't mean it
when he yells at me.

658
01:16:08,026 --> 01:16:09,141
He's scared...

659
01:16:10,404 --> 01:16:12,896
...of the man with the keys.

660
01:16:13,073 --> 01:16:15,735
He's the one controlling it all.

661
01:16:15,909 --> 01:16:18,651
He's the one who opens all the doors.

662
01:16:22,165 --> 01:16:26,204
- He opens all the red doors?
- Yes.

663
01:16:26,378 --> 01:16:29,416
The man with the keys said
I'm more powerful than I know.

664
01:16:29,589 --> 01:16:32,126
He says he wants me
to help him open every door.

665
01:16:32,301 --> 01:16:34,793
He says he'll do anything it takes
to get me.

666
01:16:37,472 --> 01:16:39,304
He's standing right behind you.

667
01:16:41,101 --> 01:16:42,341
<i>No!</i>

668
01:16:42,519 --> 01:16:45,307
Leave this place!

669
01:16:51,486 --> 01:16:54,274
Elise, wake up.

670
01:16:55,657 --> 01:16:56,818
Elise!

671
01:16:58,618 --> 01:17:00,404
Specs!

672
01:17:00,996 --> 01:17:02,282
I need help!

673
01:17:03,623 --> 01:17:06,115
Here, here. Careful with her head.

674
01:17:07,961 --> 01:17:09,961
- She's on the other side.
- Somebody has to go in.

675
01:17:10,047 --> 01:17:12,880
Yeah, who's gonna do that?
I can't do that. Can you do that?

676
01:17:13,050 --> 01:17:14,415
- I didn't say...
- I can do it.

677
01:17:17,554 --> 01:17:18,794
I can help her.

678
01:17:18,972 --> 01:17:22,556
I've never actually hypnotized
anybody before.

679
01:17:22,726 --> 01:17:24,512
I've never been hypnotized.

680
01:17:24,686 --> 01:17:27,178
Well, then you won't know
what I'm doing wrong, right?

681
01:17:33,236 --> 01:17:34,601
Okay.

682
01:17:35,530 --> 01:17:39,319
The exercise, it's a little...
I'm gonna... I'll put my finger there.

683
01:17:39,493 --> 01:17:40,904
E.T.

684
01:17:42,329 --> 01:17:43,945
Imogen.

685
01:17:44,122 --> 01:17:45,408
That's pretty cool.

686
01:17:45,957 --> 01:17:47,789
Just look here.

687
01:17:48,585 --> 01:17:50,952
And concentrate on it and just relax.

688
01:17:51,797 --> 01:17:55,711
Imagine that your body is made of water
and you're in the ocean.

689
01:17:55,884 --> 01:17:57,545
That doesn't make sense.

690
01:17:58,261 --> 01:18:00,047
- What?
- She's made of water...

691
01:18:00,222 --> 01:18:03,510
...and she's in the ocean.
Therefore, she is the ocean.

692
01:18:04,059 --> 01:18:06,016
Would you like to do this?

693
01:18:10,774 --> 01:18:13,357
- Thank you.
<i>- I'll</i> still be here.

694
01:18:13,527 --> 01:18:15,609
- Don't touch the subject.
- I'm not.

695
01:18:15,779 --> 01:18:17,486
Move away.

696
01:18:34,881 --> 01:18:36,212
Close your eyes.

697
01:18:37,259 --> 01:18:40,172
Listen to the ticking.

698
01:18:40,345 --> 01:18:42,256
Focus on it.

699
01:18:42,764 --> 01:18:45,381
I'm going to count back from five.

700
01:18:45,809 --> 01:18:50,645
By the time I reach one,
you will be hypnotized.

701
01:18:51,189 --> 01:18:53,726
Five, four...

702
01:18:54,734 --> 01:18:59,319
...three, two, one.

703
01:18:59,489 --> 01:19:02,072
Nod if you can hear me.

704
01:19:06,872 --> 01:19:10,285
When I say "now,"
you will open your eyes...

705
01:19:10,459 --> 01:19:14,168
...and you will be on the other side.

706
01:19:17,883 --> 01:19:19,715
<i>Now.</i>

707
01:19:42,574 --> 01:19:45,032
Wanna go there.

708
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:08,597
I'll help you.

709
01:20:51,601 --> 01:20:53,592
Red door.

710
01:20:54,896 --> 01:20:56,261
Red door.

711
01:20:56,439 --> 01:20:59,022
That's the red door
Elise was talking about.

712
01:20:59,943 --> 01:21:02,310
This is the place.

713
01:21:30,015 --> 01:21:31,346
I can't go in there.

714
01:21:31,516 --> 01:21:33,757
If he finds me, he'll...

715
01:21:34,436 --> 01:21:36,598
He'll take me again.

716
01:21:36,771 --> 01:21:39,980
Trust me. You'll find
what you're looking for in there.

717
01:21:43,528 --> 01:21:44,939
<i>I admit it!</i>

718
01:21:45,113 --> 01:21:46,695
<i>Shut up!</i>

719
01:21:47,991 --> 01:21:49,732
<i>That's right!</i>

720
01:21:50,827 --> 01:21:52,409
Elise?

721
01:21:54,456 --> 01:21:56,743
<i>The key is missing.</i>

722
01:21:57,500 --> 01:22:00,788
<i>You're all gonna get it again!</i>

723
01:22:20,482 --> 01:22:23,725
<i>Do you ever think about the people
who go to the electric chair?</i>

724
01:22:24,819 --> 01:22:26,150
<i>Sometimes.</i>

725
01:22:26,321 --> 01:22:28,904
<i>Do you wonder where they go?</i>

726
01:22:33,662 --> 01:22:35,778
<i>Your turn now.</i>

727
01:23:08,738 --> 01:23:10,570
<i>Look out, little girl!</i>

728
01:23:46,234 --> 01:23:50,068
<i>--Always repeats, my friends.
The ghosts of their past...</i>

729
01:23:53,074 --> 01:23:55,691
<i>--if we do not confront them head-on.</i>

730
01:24:13,261 --> 01:24:17,880
<i>If there's one thing you've been doing
your whole life, Elise, it's ask for it.</i>

731
01:24:18,057 --> 01:24:20,924
No! No, Daddy!

732
01:24:21,102 --> 01:24:23,935
<i>They're all around us in this house.</i>

733
01:24:24,105 --> 01:24:25,436
<i>Everywhere.</i>

734
01:24:28,651 --> 01:24:31,814
<i>She needs to learn nobody else
can possibly love someone like her.</i>

735
01:24:31,988 --> 01:24:34,275
Stop, Daddy, stop.

736
01:24:35,325 --> 01:24:38,158
<i>- No, Daddy, please.</i>
- Please, stop. No.

737
01:24:38,328 --> 01:24:39,989
- Stop.
<i>- No. No.</i>

738
01:24:40,163 --> 01:24:42,245
<i>No, Daddy!</i>

739
01:24:43,291 --> 01:24:44,810
<i>Some people are afraid
of special people.</i>

740
01:24:44,834 --> 01:24:47,075
<i>Your daddy is one of them.</i>

741
01:24:50,924 --> 01:24:53,416
<i>I won't let you hurt me anymore.</i>

742
01:25:05,396 --> 01:25:07,137
<i>Did you see a ghost?</i>

743
01:25:07,315 --> 01:25:09,556
<i>Just say no. That's all you have to do.</i>

744
01:25:09,734 --> 01:25:13,147
<i>You can't punish me for this.
I never wanted it. I never asked for it.</i>

745
01:25:16,032 --> 01:25:17,443
You killed your mother.

746
01:25:32,423 --> 01:25:33,834
Elise.

747
01:25:36,302 --> 01:25:37,588
Elise!

748
01:25:41,599 --> 01:25:43,306
Elise!

749
01:25:44,978 --> 01:25:47,766
He's in my head. He's in my head.

750
01:25:48,147 --> 01:25:50,855
<i>My father did the exact same thing
as Garza.</i>

751
01:25:52,735 --> 01:25:56,729
My father was your puppet.

752
01:25:57,866 --> 01:26:02,360
I am not gonna feed you
with hatred anymore, demon.

753
01:26:02,537 --> 01:26:03,868
You can fucking starve.

754
01:26:06,291 --> 01:26:07,531
Elise!

755
01:26:08,042 --> 01:26:09,407
No!

756
01:26:13,548 --> 01:26:17,462
Leave her alone!
You wanna take somebody, take me.

757
01:26:38,197 --> 01:26:39,779
Let them go.

758
01:26:41,993 --> 01:26:43,154
<i>See now?</i>

759
01:26:54,172 --> 01:26:55,833
Honey? Honey?

760
01:26:56,007 --> 01:26:58,294
Nurse! Nurse, get in here!

761
01:26:59,510 --> 01:27:01,092
Melissa!

762
01:27:09,228 --> 01:27:10,468
It's okay, it's okay.

763
01:27:11,981 --> 01:27:13,722
One, two, three, four.

764
01:27:24,911 --> 01:27:26,697
I'm sorry.

765
01:27:32,961 --> 01:27:34,076
No! No!

766
01:27:35,546 --> 01:27:40,040
No!

767
01:27:59,946 --> 01:28:01,436
Elise!

768
01:28:52,457 --> 01:28:54,323
Hands off my little girl.

769
01:29:30,912 --> 01:29:32,698
No, no, no.

770
01:29:32,872 --> 01:29:34,613
Elise!

771
01:29:34,791 --> 01:29:36,532
She's hurt

772
01:30:16,874 --> 01:30:19,161
Return to your body. Go.

773
01:30:27,260 --> 01:30:28,716
Baby.

774
01:30:29,387 --> 01:30:31,003
Oh, Dad.

775
01:30:31,180 --> 01:30:33,592
Elise, she saved me.

776
01:30:57,373 --> 01:30:59,159
I don't know the words.

777
01:31:03,462 --> 01:31:05,794
I already know, my love.

778
01:31:12,847 --> 01:31:14,508
Keep helping people.

779
01:31:34,076 --> 01:31:35,817
Go home.

780
01:31:45,421 --> 01:31:47,628
Imogen, wake up!

781
01:31:48,758 --> 01:31:49,964
Are you okay?

782
01:31:50,134 --> 01:31:51,374
Yeah, I think so.

783
01:31:54,180 --> 01:31:57,423
You can't get rid of me that easy.
The hospital.

784
01:32:01,437 --> 01:32:06,807
<i>Nurse needed in ICU stat.</i>

785
01:32:09,403 --> 01:32:11,019
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Hey.

786
01:32:11,197 --> 01:32:12,312
Hi.

787
01:32:12,490 --> 01:32:14,026
I'm okay.

788
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:16,487
Oh, my God.

789
01:32:16,953 --> 01:32:18,443
Hi.

790
01:32:34,053 --> 01:32:35,760
I believe this is yours.

791
01:32:42,353 --> 01:32:43,969
You were right, Christian.

792
01:32:44,146 --> 01:32:45,682
I'm cursed.

793
01:32:45,856 --> 01:32:48,598
Demons follow me around.

794
01:32:49,735 --> 01:32:54,821
But I don't want to give them
what they want for one second longer.

795
01:32:54,991 --> 01:32:58,029
Fear and pain is what feeds them.

796
01:32:59,287 --> 01:33:01,870
I'm the one that's been feeding them...

797
01:33:02,039 --> 01:33:04,531
...shutting you out all these years.

798
01:33:05,418 --> 01:33:07,034
You forgive me?

799
01:33:07,211 --> 01:33:09,327
I never should have left you.

800
01:33:16,887 --> 01:33:18,594
Thank you.

801
01:33:19,307 --> 01:33:20,889
Yes.

802
01:33:28,524 --> 01:33:30,185
Melissa...

803
01:33:30,359 --> 01:33:32,191
...you gonna eat that?

804
01:33:33,612 --> 01:33:35,068
Go for it.

805
01:33:38,743 --> 01:33:43,158
You know, I always thought
that I was afraid of dying...

806
01:33:44,206 --> 01:33:46,994
...but now I realize that I wasn't.

807
01:33:47,793 --> 01:33:49,875
I was afraid of dying...

808
01:33:50,046 --> 01:33:53,289
...before I truly had a family again.

809
01:33:55,051 --> 01:33:56,758
Now I do.

810
01:33:57,219 --> 01:33:58,880
Son of a...

811
01:33:59,555 --> 01:34:01,045
I told you not to park there.

812
01:34:01,223 --> 01:34:04,056
- Just saying, I did.
- Listen to your buddy.

813
01:34:04,894 --> 01:34:07,386
He gets the girl, I get the ticket?

814
01:34:08,731 --> 01:34:10,187
I'm riding shotgun.

815
01:34:10,358 --> 01:34:13,225
We'll have to come back here
to deal with that ticket.

816
01:34:57,738 --> 01:34:59,399
Dalton.

817
01:35:00,074 --> 01:35:03,157
Today was just so horrible.
I'm scared nothing's gonna change.

818
01:35:03,327 --> 01:35:04,658
It will.

819
