653
00:36:24,697 --> 00:36:27,465
But don't worry, fuckin'
Columbo here is on the case.

654
00:36:27,467 --> 00:36:28,699
Oh, I hate that show.

655
00:36:28,701 --> 00:36:30,237
That's not my point.

656
00:36:33,773 --> 00:36:35,675
Who the hell would
do this to you, Hank?

657
00:36:36,742 --> 00:36:38,476
I have no idea.

658
00:36:38,478 --> 00:36:40,313
Hm.

659
00:36:41,481 --> 00:36:42,516
Spank.

660
00:36:43,583 --> 00:36:44,648
[laughing]

661
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:46,650
You know it, it
is kind of funny.

662
00:36:46,652 --> 00:36:52,322
[both laughing]

663
00:36:52,324 --> 00:36:53,490
You know, like
spank spank?

664
00:36:53,492 --> 00:36:55,191
Alright, c'mon,
knock that off Romero.

665
00:36:55,193 --> 00:36:56,059
Alright, just go get
something to help clean

666
00:36:56,061 --> 00:36:57,094
this off.

667
00:36:57,096 --> 00:36:58,329
Si, old Gor.

668
00:36:58,331 --> 00:37:00,164
Sorry Spank. I mean Hank!

669
00:37:00,166 --> 00:37:02,102
[laughing]

670
00:37:03,436 --> 00:37:05,135
The hell is going
on out here?

671
00:37:05,137 --> 00:37:07,708
Oh, uh, nothing.

672
00:37:08,708 --> 00:37:10,242
I'm on my way to
the course I'll...

673
00:37:12,277 --> 00:37:13,312
I'll see y'all later.

674
00:37:18,583 --> 00:37:19,618
Oh.

675
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,322
Well that's not very nice.

676
00:37:23,789 --> 00:37:25,057
I'm gonna go get ready.

677
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:27,527
Big day planned?

678
00:37:32,731 --> 00:37:34,333
Gonna head over
to the marina.

679
00:37:36,469 --> 00:37:37,570
I like boats.

680
00:37:38,771 --> 00:37:40,173
Yeah, they got those.

681
00:37:41,474 --> 00:37:43,807
Little bit beat up, but,
you should check it out

682
00:37:43,809 --> 00:37:45,112
some time.

683
00:37:46,344 --> 00:37:48,612
Well, have a good one.

684
00:37:48,614 --> 00:37:49,715
Enjoy your day.

685
00:37:52,617 --> 00:37:53,719
Hey, Hank?

686
00:37:57,255 --> 00:37:58,591
Want some company?

687
00:38:06,231 --> 00:38:07,434
[boat honks]

688
00:38:20,112 --> 00:38:20,878
Sorry.

689
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,215
It's Marcus.

690
00:38:22,882 --> 00:38:24,217
Marcus.

691
00:38:26,885 --> 00:38:28,721
Oh, look. La Tortuga.

692
00:38:30,188 --> 00:38:31,521
Hey, you should buy it.

693
00:38:31,523 --> 00:38:35,628
Well, maybe in a past life.

694
00:38:36,561 --> 00:38:38,230
I don't need it now.

695
00:38:39,532 --> 00:38:41,632
That where you hide
all them dead bodies?

696
00:38:41,634 --> 00:38:43,467
Huh?

697
00:38:43,469 --> 00:38:45,802
There's some rumors about
you at school, you know.

698
00:38:45,804 --> 00:38:47,807
About your past and stuff.

699
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:52,309
No one knows about me
before I came here.

700
00:38:52,311 --> 00:38:53,878
Then why do I hear some
shit about you and

701
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,449
dead bodies?

702
00:38:57,215 --> 00:38:59,385
You ought to rethink
who you hang with.

703
00:39:00,385 --> 00:39:02,154
Well, I told him
it wasn't true.

704
00:39:04,422 --> 00:39:06,392
So, what did
you do before?

705
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,862
Well, I wasn't cutting
corpses, but I did do

706
00:39:11,864 --> 00:39:14,568
something kind of
weird, I guess.

707
00:39:15,835 --> 00:39:18,538
Don't feel good to think
about it so I don't.

708
00:39:19,605 --> 00:39:20,606
Like what?

709
00:39:24,876 --> 00:39:26,880
I lived in Huntsville,
Texas. You know it?

710
00:39:27,914 --> 00:39:29,213
Never heard of it.

711
00:39:29,215 --> 00:39:30,617
Didn't think you would.

712
00:39:32,818 --> 00:39:34,121
Small place.

713
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,989
Unremarkable.

714
00:39:37,322 --> 00:39:39,623
But there's a prison there
that executes more people

715
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:41,527
than anywhere else
in the country.

716
00:39:43,762 --> 00:39:46,699
I started working there
when I was just 20 years old.

717
00:39:49,534 --> 00:39:51,137
Just a regular guard.

718
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,541
Then they put me on
the tie-down team.

719
00:39:57,543 --> 00:39:59,376
What's that?

720
00:39:59,378 --> 00:40:00,881
Just as it sounds, really.

721
00:40:01,746 --> 00:40:03,847
We was responsible for
securing the inmate to the

722
00:40:03,849 --> 00:40:07,952
gurney, tying down the
straps, making sure he

723
00:40:07,954 --> 00:40:09,289
couldn't move.

724
00:40:10,356 --> 00:40:14,691
IV's would go in, the
shade would fly up so the

725
00:40:14,693 --> 00:40:16,529
people that came
to see could watch.

726
00:40:18,264 --> 00:40:20,463
Last words were said.

727
00:40:20,465 --> 00:40:24,802
Then this doctor hits the
switch and we just watched

728
00:40:24,804 --> 00:40:29,276
a man or woman take
their last breath.

729
00:40:33,778 --> 00:40:35,912
Jesus, that's heavy.

730
00:40:35,914 --> 00:40:38,282
Yeah.

731
00:40:38,284 --> 00:40:39,552
It was a heavy job.

732
00:40:44,824 --> 00:40:46,193
Why'd you leave?

733
00:40:50,028 --> 00:40:51,764
Found out we
killed someone...

734
00:40:56,034 --> 00:40:57,703
Who shouldn't
have been killed.

735
00:41:03,576 --> 00:41:05,778
First time the government
ever admitted that happened.

736
00:41:08,347 --> 00:41:09,583
Really?

737
00:41:10,615 --> 00:41:13,784
I feel like you always
hear about DNA or whatever

738
00:41:13,786 --> 00:41:16,353
getting people
off death row.

739
00:41:16,355 --> 00:41:19,055
Yeah, off death row.

740
00:41:19,057 --> 00:41:22,762
Can't dig someone
up and say "sorry."

741
00:41:25,498 --> 00:41:26,630
Was it recent?

742
00:41:26,632 --> 00:41:28,731
Nah, it happened
years ago.

743
00:41:28,733 --> 00:41:31,869
But the evidence came to
pass just a few years back.

744
00:41:31,871 --> 00:41:33,373
That guy we killed?

745
00:41:34,974 --> 00:41:35,642
Shit.

746
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:39,846
I just couldn't
forget no more.

747
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,947
I packed my bags, I threw
'em in the truck and I

748
00:41:43,949 --> 00:41:46,383
drove and drove
and drove 'til I...

749
00:41:46,385 --> 00:41:47,954
'til I felt like quitting.

750
00:41:50,922 --> 00:41:51,991
Landed here.

751
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:55,027
Stayed.

752
00:41:57,730 --> 00:41:59,396
I can't...

753
00:41:59,398 --> 00:42:02,700
can't even imagine what
it was like watching all

754
00:42:02,702 --> 00:42:04,471
those people die.

755
00:42:06,338 --> 00:42:07,806
I wish I couldn't either.

756
00:42:11,876 --> 00:42:13,012
C'mon, let's
get out of here.

757
00:42:14,713 --> 00:42:15,614
Yeah.

758
00:42:26,092 --> 00:42:28,592
Hey, thanks for
bringing me along.

759
00:42:28,594 --> 00:42:29,929
I really enjoyed it.

760
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:32,666
Yeah, me too.

761
00:42:33,532 --> 00:42:34,865
The sun's still out.

762
00:42:34,867 --> 00:42:36,032
Why don't we lay around
the pool for a little bit

763
00:42:36,034 --> 00:42:37,636
when we get back?

764
00:42:40,505 --> 00:42:42,606
Ah, well, I'm not much
of a pool guy.

765
00:42:42,608 --> 00:42:44,778
C'mon, it's no fun
out there all alone.

766
00:42:48,914 --> 00:42:50,750
I suppose a little sun
wouldn't hurt none.

767
00:43:11,436 --> 00:43:13,706
Oh, hell no. I ain't doing it.

768
00:43:16,141 --> 00:43:17,676
Christ, you gotta...

769
00:43:30,688 --> 00:43:31,824
Here we go now.

770
00:43:32,824 --> 00:43:33,992
Here we go.

771
00:43:38,963 --> 00:43:40,032
Oh, hey there.

772
00:43:40,965 --> 00:43:42,000
Hey.

773
00:43:45,003 --> 00:43:46,373
Feels nice out
here, doesn't it.

774
00:43:47,873 --> 00:43:48,875
Yeah.

775
00:43:50,443 --> 00:43:51,678
It is.

776
00:43:54,914 --> 00:43:55,845
Oh.

777
00:43:55,847 --> 00:43:57,583
I never come out here.

778
00:44:02,655 --> 00:44:07,093
It's nice you can just let
everything slip away and just...

779
00:44:08,193 --> 00:44:09,962
Just relax.

780
00:44:13,731 --> 00:44:15,065
Yeah.

781
00:44:15,067 --> 00:44:16,467
That sounds good.

782
00:44:16,469 --> 00:44:18,037
I-I could use some of that.

783
00:44:21,873 --> 00:44:23,706
Those swim trunks get any
shorter and you'll be

784
00:44:23,708 --> 00:44:26,476
ready for a European
beach party.

785
00:44:26,478 --> 00:44:28,747
Yeah, eh...

786
00:44:30,148 --> 00:44:33,717
If you're going to have
some kind of illegal sex

787
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:35,952
relationship with someone
who is not of age, you

788
00:44:35,954 --> 00:44:38,121
don't rub everybody's
nose in it.

789
00:44:38,123 --> 00:44:40,557
God damn it, Martha!

790
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:41,891
We talked about this.

791
00:44:41,893 --> 00:44:42,992
Just mind your
own business.

792
00:44:42,994 --> 00:44:44,494
Well how can I?

793
00:44:44,496 --> 00:44:46,162
Look at them, there is
no discretion at all?

794
00:44:46,164 --> 00:44:48,065
Maybe that's the point. There's
nothing to hide.

795
00:44:48,067 --> 00:44:50,833
Oh, or they're hiding
in plain sight.

796
00:44:50,835 --> 00:44:53,737
Oh boy, they're hiding in
plain sight and you caught 'em.

797
00:44:53,739 --> 00:44:55,204
Will you let me
watch the game?

798
00:44:55,206 --> 00:44:56,673
(Josie) ...go for a
ride on your boat?

799
00:44:56,675 --> 00:44:58,141
(Hank) Well, "boat" is a
bit of a stretch.

800
00:44:58,143 --> 00:44:59,275
(Josie) Oh, well,
whatever it is.

801
00:44:59,277 --> 00:45:00,476
Let's go for an
evening ride.

802
00:45:00,478 --> 00:45:03,914
(Hank) Alright, I-I'll pick
you up tomorrow around nine.

803
00:45:03,916 --> 00:45:05,048
Yoo-hoo!

804
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:06,885
- Shit...
- Oh, hey Martha.

805
00:45:08,686 --> 00:45:10,019
Good afternoon
Mrs. Joiner.

806
00:45:10,021 --> 00:45:12,688
I saw you two out here
lounging and I thought

807
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:14,023
you'd might
like a beverage.

808
00:45:14,025 --> 00:45:15,861
Oh, thank you.

809
00:45:16,829 --> 00:45:18,295
That's mighty kind of you.

810
00:45:18,297 --> 00:45:19,898
Oh, it's nothing.

811
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:23,833
So, what are you
two chatting about?

812
00:45:23,835 --> 00:45:24,934
Oh, excuse me dear.

813
00:45:24,936 --> 00:45:26,269
Oh, we were just
talking about...

814
00:45:26,271 --> 00:45:27,304
No, just some
school stuff.

815
00:45:27,306 --> 00:45:29,539
There's been some
