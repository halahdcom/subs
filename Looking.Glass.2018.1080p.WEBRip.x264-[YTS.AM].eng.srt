Were there domestic
dispute calls

868

made to the residence?
Was the wife

01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:30,645
a known substance abuser?

870
01:24:30,647 --> 01:24:32,082
Or the husband a heavy drinker?

871
01:24:32,549 --> 01:24:36,019
And why
was the husband socializing...

872
01:24:36,420 --> 01:24:38,923
with the neighbor next
door during the incident?

873

Can the parents be charged
with child negligence?
