Oh! Gracious. Oh, my gosh.

Hey! Morning! Oh!

40
00:02:29,231 --> 00:02:30,431
- Hey!
- Sorry.

41
00:02:30,499 --> 00:02:31,966
I didn't realize
you were masturbating.

42
00:02:32,035 --> 00:02:32,933
Yeah, very funny.

43
00:02:33,234 --> 00:02:34,267
Your sister's downstairs
making some

44
00:02:34,438 --> 00:02:36,405
la-di-da pancake thing
she saw on <i>Top Chef,</i>

45
00:02:36,472 --> 00:02:38,171
so we should
probably go eat that.

46
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,606
Great. I'll be down
in just a second.

47
00:02:39,806 --> 00:02:42,940
Okay. Right after you finish
searching the internet for...

48
00:02:43,311 --> 00:02:45,412
lingerie photos of Gigi Habib?

49
00:02:45,613 --> 00:02:48,080
It's Hadid.

50
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:50,583
Right. I didn't realize
she was your girlfriend.

51
00:02:50,652 --> 00:02:51,953
All right, finish up here.

52
00:02:53,254 --> 00:02:54,155
You got me.

53
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:05,799
- Morning, guys.
- Simon, have a seat, honey.

54
00:03:05,867 --> 00:03:07,201
- Morning, Simon.
- You gotta eat your breakfast.

55
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:08,170
Please don't tell me

56
00:03:08,604 --> 00:03:09,804
that breakfast is the most
important meal of the day

57
00:03:09,938 --> 00:03:11,939
because that is just so cliché.
You're better than that.

58
00:03:12,206 --> 00:03:14,272
I was gonna say breakfast
lowers LDL cholesterol

59
00:03:14,342 --> 00:03:16,178
and prevents
fluctuating glucose levels

60
00:03:16,245 --> 00:03:17,878
- that lead to type two diabetes.
- Oh!

61
00:03:18,646 --> 00:03:19,546
Touché.

62
00:03:20,115 --> 00:03:22,250
Nora. These are incredible.

63
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,418
Cornmeal pancakes
with blackberry compote.

64
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,487
But they're not crumbly enough.

65
00:03:26,589 --> 00:03:28,655
Stop it. They're perfect.

66
00:03:29,957 --> 00:03:30,925
Eat up, Bieber.

67
00:03:32,527 --> 00:03:33,627
- See you, guys.
- See you, Simon.

68
00:03:33,795 --> 00:03:35,897
Hey, honey. Be back
by seven! It's TV night.

69
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:49,811
Hey!

70
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,110
Morning!

71
00:03:51,513 --> 00:03:53,580
It's Simon! I live right here!

72
00:03:55,216 --> 00:03:56,684
I like your boots!

73
00:04:00,088 --> 00:04:00,988
Okay, bye!

74
00:04:09,364 --> 00:04:10,598

Had the craziest dream
last night.

79
00:04:33,055 --> 00:04:35,088
Hey, Nick, you have the
craziest dream every night.

80
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:36,689
You don't understand.
I'm in this cave, right?

81
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:37,825
Or maybe it's in outer space.

82
00:04:38,094 --> 00:04:39,661
David Beckham is there
with these two contact lenses

83
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:42,295
and then like, blue one or
red one, like he's a sexy

84
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,596
Morpheus from <i>Matrix.</i>

85
00:04:43,697 --> 00:04:44,898
And I don't know
which one to pick.

86
00:04:44,966 --> 00:04:46,601
I don't know what to do
with these things.

87
00:04:46,836 --> 00:04:49,270
Oh, my God. Have you guys seen
<i>Creek Secrets</i> today?

88
00:04:49,371 --> 00:04:51,572
First of all, you are obsessed
with that blog, so...

89
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:53,307
Okay, but apparently,
Becca Peterson

90
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,009
got caught giving
Ryan O'Donovan,

91
00:04:55,077 --> 00:04:56,010
an HJ in the pool.

92
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,778
That's the real reason
they drained it.

93
00:04:57,847 --> 00:04:59,314
Man, our janitor needs a raise.

94
00:04:59,381 --> 00:05:00,281
Oh, my God.

95
00:05:00,415 --> 00:05:01,716
And an HPV vaccine.

96
00:05:02,549 --> 00:05:03,650
Leah, I have this dream,
right?

97
00:05:03,784 --> 00:05:05,253
Nick, we have a rule,
remember?

98
00:05:05,322 --> 00:05:07,056
No analyzing dreams
before coffee.

99
00:05:10,992 --> 00:05:12,093
Hi, could we get
four iced coffees, please?

100
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,294
Oh, could you get Abby's
with milk? She likes milk.

101
00:05:14,696 --> 00:05:16,662
- One with milk.
- What are you, her barista?

102
00:05:17,197 --> 00:05:20,166
It's not hard
to remember "with milk."

103
00:05:24,605 --> 00:05:25,706
Thank you.

Oh, thank you.
I am figuratively dying.

109
00:05:41,224 --> 00:05:42,956
So, Abby, last night I dreamt

110
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:44,656
I put the wrong contacts
in my eyes.

111
00:05:44,726 --> 00:05:46,793
- Another dream. You're like...
- Hmm.

112
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,061
You're like the love child of

113
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:50,530
Sigmund Freud
and Cristiano Ronaldo.

114
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,233
- Oh, my God.
- Thanks.

115
00:05:52,466 --> 00:05:53,866
Now, look. I can't see anything

116
00:05:53,935 --> 00:05:55,536
and I'm stumbling around
in this cave,

117
00:05:55,603 --> 00:05:58,037
crashing into stuff,
and then, I wake up.

118
00:05:58,406 --> 00:06:00,074
- That's it?
- Yeah.

119
00:06:00,675 --> 00:06:02,341
Maybe it's something that
you're not seeing clearly.

120
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:04,644
Like something that's, like,
right in front of your face.

121
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:06,315
What am I not seeing?

122
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:08,882
No idea.

142

Come on, phones off!

143
00:07:17,118 --> 00:07:18,618
There's a whole world
to look at!

144
00:07:18,952 --> 00:07:20,687
You can look people
in the eyes!

145
00:07:20,822 --> 00:07:22,956
Gah! Yeah.

146
00:07:23,158 --> 00:07:24,624
Stop with the selfies.
You're not all that.

147

149
00:07:28,931 --> 00:07:30,365
Look at those new kicks,
my brother.

150
00:07:30,431 --> 00:07:32,365
Where'd you get those? Where
could I get a pair of those?

151
00:07:32,732 --> 00:07:33,932
- I forget. Sorry.
- You forget?

152
00:07:33,999 --> 00:07:35,500
Come on, you gotta let me
know the brand!

153
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:36,838

You can get 'em at my office!

156

I can't believe we have to be
off book, in like, two weeks.

00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:52,652
Don't you wish
you were talentless like me?

159
00:07:52,721 --> 00:07:53,820
Here. Let me show you
a thing or two.

160
00:07:54,156 --> 00:07:55,555
Because then you could
just be living the easy life

161
00:07:55,623 --> 00:07:56,724
as company member
number eight.

162
00:07:58,225 --> 00:07:59,893
Well, well, well...

163
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,460
If it isn't my fellow thespians.

164
00:08:03,498 --> 00:08:04,398
Hey, Martin.

165
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:06,866
Hey, Spier. Hey, Abby.

166
00:08:07,235 --> 00:08:07,935
Hi.

167
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,105
Excited to rehearse
with you later.

168
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:12,306
Hey, uh, so, fun fact.

169
00:08:12,607 --> 00:08:14,541
You know that <i>Cabaret</i>
was actually based off a play

170
00:08:14,609 --> 00:08:15,811
called <i>I Am Camera?</i>

171
00:08:15,878 --> 00:08:17,577
Then <i>I Am a Camera</i>
was based off

172
00:08:17,644 --> 00:08:19,812
this novel called
<i>Goodbye to Berlin.</i>

173
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,180
And <i>Goodbye to Berlin</i>
was actually based off

174
00:08:22,316 --> 00:08:23,484
Christopher Isherwood's

175
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,652
early years in Berlin.

176
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,786
Wow. That's awesome.
I have homeroom.

177
00:08:27,856 --> 00:08:28,756
Yeah. All right.

178
00:08:28,991 --> 00:08:30,457
Well, I think she
found that interesting.

179
00:08:30,525 --> 00:08:31,424
Bye, Martin.

180
00:08:31,892 --> 00:08:33,492
Bye, big boy.

181
00:08:34,829 --> 00:08:37,030
Suraj! Now.

182
00:08:38,499 --> 00:08:40,000
Come on. You know the drill.

183
00:08:41,102 --> 00:08:43,603
<i>I've had an inspiration.
How about</i> The Affair?

184
00:08:44,105 --> 00:08:46,507
No. No. We cannot watch
<i>The Affair</i> as a family.

185
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,976
- Why not?
- Because it's all about sex.

186
00:08:49,211 --> 00:08:51,513
Oh, well, God forbid we should
watch people make love.

187
00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:52,478
Oh, God.

188
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:54,948
Oh, my God.
You guys are so repressed.

189
00:08:55,218 --> 00:08:58,184
Don't therapize us, okay?
We are not your patients.

190
00:08:58,252 --> 00:08:59,453
- We're your family.
- That's true.

191
00:08:59,688 --> 00:09:01,855
If you were my patients, you'd
be much more well-adjusted.

192
00:09:01,924 --> 00:09:04,191
- Oh. Nice therapy burn, baby.
- Thank you.

193
00:09:04,592 --> 00:09:05,859
- She got you.
- You know what?

194
00:09:05,994 --> 00:09:07,961
We didn't see last week's
episode of <i>The Bachelor.</i>

195
00:09:08,196 --> 00:09:10,062
Yeah, how did that guy
even become the bachelor?

196
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:10,829
Why?

197
00:09:10,931 --> 00:09:12,531
Well, he's clearly gay.

198
00:09:12,867 --> 00:09:14,535
- No, he's not.
- Really?

199
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:15,603
- He's handsome.
- That date,

200
00:09:15,671 --> 00:09:16,571
where he took the girl to

201
00:09:16,705 --> 00:09:17,938
the "make your
own perfume" place?

202
00:09:18,004 --> 00:09:19,837
Dad! The producers
plan those dates.

203
00:09:19,907 --> 00:09:21,108
He is so fruity.
He's so fruity.

204
00:09:21,177 --> 00:09:23,243
He's a one-man pride parade.
Are you kidding me?

205
00:09:23,377 --> 00:09:24,910
- He has more chemistry
- Just stop it.

206
00:09:24,978 --> 00:09:27,412
with Chris Harrison,
than any of those girls.

207
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:30,617
After this, I gotta
show you something.

208
00:09:31,052 --> 00:09:32,418
Okay?
Let's watch <i>The Americans.</i>

209
00:09:32,486 --> 00:09:34,687
Every single episode,
you here next to me.

210
00:09:34,756 --> 00:09:36,156
So your mother decided
that we should make

211
00:09:36,224 --> 00:09:37,590
each other anniversary
presents this year.

212
00:09:37,657 --> 00:09:40,026
You know, so they came
from the heart, or some crap.

213
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:42,595
Anyway, I decided to come up
with this bad boy.

214
00:09:42,696 --> 00:09:43,596
Look at this.

215
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,498
I present to you,
a Jack Spier production.

216
00:09:48,371 --> 00:09:51,239
<i>♪ I don't need to be the king

219
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:55,976
Oh, it's so good.

220

<i>♪ As long as I'm the hero

221
00:10:01,683 --> 00:10:03,149

Wait, wait, wait.

222

<i>♪ Heaven isn't too far away ♪</i>

223
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,322
Yup. Okay.

224
00:10:08,823 --> 00:10:09,723
What are you...

225
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,357
Look, this is your
20th anniversary,

226
00:10:12,427 --> 00:10:14,361
so I'm gonna be super real
with you right now.

227
00:10:14,862 --> 00:10:16,397
This looks
like a fourth grader made it.

228
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,097
And not even the smartest
fourth grader in the class.

229
00:10:19,235 --> 00:10:20,935
Just, like,
a deeply average fourth grader.

230
00:10:21,001 --> 00:10:22,802
What are you talking about?
This is amazing.

231
00:10:22,936 --> 00:10:24,970
I got fade-ins.
I got dissolves.

232
00:10:25,075 --> 00:10:26,609
- This is beautiful.
- Get up for a second.

233
00:10:26,675 --> 00:10:27,975
I'll help you. Trust me.

234
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:30,210
We can make this good.
We just gotta put in...

235
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,410
you know, some home video.

236
00:10:32,982 --> 00:10:35,717
Maybe put in some better music.

237
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:38,351
"Better music"? This was huge
when we were young.

238
00:10:38,587 --> 00:10:40,621
Yeah. So was Bill Cosby.

239
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:54,567

00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,884
- Simonay, Simonay.
- Hey.

314
00:15:39,955 --> 00:15:42,122
What are you doing?
You can't text in the halls.

315
00:15:42,189 --> 00:15:43,322
How many times
have I told you that?

316
00:15:43,456 --> 00:15:44,523
I can't have all my students

317
00:15:44,592 --> 00:15:46,226
Tindering it up.
That's my department.

318
00:15:46,294 --> 00:15:47,594
Right.

319
00:15:47,661 --> 00:15:48,393
It actually is.

320
00:15:48,594 --> 00:15:50,629
I got a really hot date
on Tinder tonight.

321
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,095
She is cute!

322
00:15:52,601 --> 00:15:56,901
"Ew! Vice principals can't go
on dates. That's gross."

323
00:15:56,903 --> 00:15:58,170
We're people too, Simon.

324
00:15:58,572 --> 00:16:00,340
We like to go out.
We like to have a good time.

325
00:16:00,407 --> 00:16:02,274
We like to have sex.
That's not a big deal, right?

326
00:16:02,341 --> 00:16:03,576
Yeah, no. No biggie at all.

327
00:16:03,643 --> 00:16:05,311
Actually. You know,
I totally see you as a person.

328
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,546
- Thank you. I appreciate that.
- Yeah.

329
00:16:06,613 --> 00:16:08,047
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

330
00:16:08,113 --> 00:16:09,314
- Seriously.
- Yeah. Yeah.

331
00:16:09,382 --> 00:16:10,449
Could I just get
my phone though?

332
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,817
No. Unfortunately, I'm gonna
have to keep it

333
00:16:11,886 --> 00:16:12,986
until after play practice.

334
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,421
But you will get your precious

335
00:16:14,588 --> 00:16:16,256
after play practice, okay?
I promise.

336
00:16:16,523 --> 00:16:17,790
So how's play practice going?

337
00:16:17,957 --> 00:16:19,857
- Great. Yeah, it's...
- How's Ms. Albright?

338
00:16:19,995 --> 00:16:21,361
She's good.

339
00:16:21,428 --> 00:16:23,529
She's good?
She doesn't like men.

Cal, help me. That was...

348
00:17:02,769 --> 00:17:03,501
That was a start?

That was a start.

351
00:17:07,407 --> 00:17:09,942
You know, when Mr. Worth
told me that no student,

352
00:17:10,244 --> 00:17:12,011
regardless of talent...

353
00:17:12,546 --> 00:17:15,180
...was to be left out of
my production, I had my doubts.

00:17:15,482 --> 00:17:17,316
Yes, I did.

355
00:17:18,051 --> 00:17:18,952
Yeah.

356
00:17:20,088 --> 00:17:22,253
That's it.
That's my whole speech.

357
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,355
Ms. Albright.

358
00:17:23,523 --> 00:17:26,225
Hi. That was
the biggest train wreck

359
00:17:26,292 --> 00:17:27,358
our stage has ever seen.

360
00:17:27,426 --> 00:17:28,459
And Rob and Brianne

361
00:17:28,595 --> 00:17:30,162
were practically dry
humping the whole song.

362
00:17:30,498 --> 00:17:31,765
Oh, I saw.

363
00:17:32,266 --> 00:17:35,235
Save the kissing
for the cast party. All right?

364
00:17:35,535 --> 00:17:39,103
This is war. You're Nazis.
Okay? More anger.

365
00:17:39,506 --> 00:17:42,808
Suraj, stop pretending
that trumpet is your penis!

366
00:17:43,044 --> 00:17:44,344
My boy.

367
00:17:45,013 --> 00:17:46,013
It is a rental.

368
00:17:48,115 --> 00:17:50,083
I was an extra

00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,517

Hey. What time is it?

371
00:17:55,723 --> 00:17:58,291
Ten minutes since the last time
you asked. Go.

372
00:17:58,892 --> 00:18:01,060
One! Two! Three! Four!

Oy, yoy, yoy, yoy, yo!

376
00:18:07,934 --> 00:18:09,935
- Mr. Worth.
- Hey, what's up, my brother?

377
00:18:10,003 --> 00:18:11,405
Hey, just here for my phone.

378
00:18:11,503 --> 00:18:13,539
Oh, of course you are.
Of course you are.

379
00:18:13,673 --> 00:18:15,173
How'd you enjoy
being unplugged?

380
00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:16,242
It was great.

381
00:18:16,544 --> 00:18:17,444
- Great, right?
- Yeah.

382
00:18:17,612 --> 00:18:19,212
This isn't life, man.
This is plugged.

383
00:18:19,379 --> 00:18:20,946
- This is unplugged.
- Mm-hmm.

384
00:18:21,047 --> 00:18:23,013
Plugged. Unplugged.

385
00:18:23,718 --> 00:18:25,920
All right, Simon, I know that
I'm hard on you. I really do.

386
00:18:26,086 --> 00:18:27,152
Mm-hmm.

387
00:18:27,354 --> 00:18:29,688
But it's only 'cause I really
see myself in you.

388
00:18:30,024 --> 00:18:32,690
Uh... You know, I don't know
if I'd say that.

389
00:18:32,892 --> 00:18:34,928
No, I see it, it's obvious.
It's obvious.

390
00:18:35,462 --> 00:18:36,361
I know there's a lot

391
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:37,663
- going on there, man.
- Yup.

392
00:18:37,797 --> 00:18:39,397
And I bet you got
a lot of questions.

393
00:18:39,465 --> 00:18:40,900
Is there something
you wanna say to me?

394
00:18:41,768 --> 00:18:42,468
No.

395
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:44,071
You know my policy.
What does it say?

396
00:18:44,772 --> 00:18:46,739
- "Open door. Open ears."
- "Open door. Open ears."

397
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,907
There's nothing
you want to say?

398
00:18:49,275 --> 00:18:50,677
- Nope.
- You sure?

399
00:18:50,978 --> 00:18:51,677
- Yeah.
- Okay.

400
00:18:51,878 --> 00:18:53,012
- It's a great sign though.
- Thank you.

401
00:18:53,245 --> 00:18:54,378
Thank you.
Now don't text and drive.

402
00:18:54,447 --> 00:18:55,614
That's how my cat
got murdered.

403
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,415
Okay.

404
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:00,019
I'm just kidding.
I don't have cats. I got asthma.

405
00:19:18,271 --> 00:19:19,237
<i>A secret, huh?</i>

406
00:19:19,605 --> 00:19:21,207
<i>Is it the same as my secret?</i>

407
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,677
<i>If it is, when did you know?</i>

408
00:19:23,878 --> 00:19:26,712
<i>Have you told anyone? Blue.</i>

409
00:19:28,949 --> 00:19:29,851
Okay.

410
00:19:42,695 --> 00:19:45,263
<i>No, Blue.
I haven't told anyone.</i>

411
00:19:45,832 --> 00:19:48,166
<i>And, honestly, I can't even
really explain why.</i>

412
00:19:49,569 --> 00:19:51,904
<i>Deep down, I know my family
would be fine with it.</i>

413
00:19:52,203 --> 00:19:54,004
Hey, what rhymes
with "patriarchy"?

414
00:19:55,042 --> 00:19:56,475
That says "patriachy" though.

415
00:19:57,042 --> 00:19:58,042
Oh, shit.

416
00:19:59,112 --> 00:20:01,179
<i>My mom's about
as liberal as they come.</i>

417
00:20:01,547 --> 00:20:03,916
<i>And my dad isn't exactly
the macho type.</i>

418
00:20:04,785 --> 00:20:06,052
<i>I mean, Creekwood's resident</i>

419
00:20:06,118 --> 00:20:08,219
<i>out-gay kid
seems to be doing just fine.</i>

420
00:20:08,488 --> 00:20:10,122
<i>When Ethan came out,
no one even cared.</i>

421
00:20:10,257 --> 00:20:12,891
Guys, I have something
to tell you.

422
00:20:13,826 --> 00:20:14,527
I'm gay.

423
00:20:15,062 --> 00:20:18,864
Wow, really?
That's really great, Ethan.

424
00:20:19,132 --> 00:20:20,498
Oh, my God. No way.

425
00:20:20,868 --> 00:20:23,569
Oh, my God, you are?
I had no idea.

426
00:20:23,637 --> 00:20:25,405
What a complete surprise!

427
00:20:25,571 --> 00:20:26,936
Too much, Claire.

428
00:20:27,507 --> 00:20:29,275
<i>As for how I knew
I was gay,</i>

429
00:20:29,342 --> 00:20:30,811
<i>it was a bunch of
little things.</i>

430
00:20:31,743 --> 00:20:33,279
<i>Like this one recurring dream</i>

431
00:20:33,346 --> 00:20:35,214
<i>I kept having
about Daniel Radcliffe.</i>

432
00:20:40,922 --> 00:20:43,457
<i>And then proceeded to have
every night for a month.</i>

433
00:20:50,029 --> 00:20:51,662
<i>I was obsessed
with Panic! at the Disco.</i>

434
00:20:51,729 --> 00:20:54,331
I can't. He's so cute.
He's so cute.

435
00:20:55,636 --> 00:20:57,170
Come on,
he's like Jesus and chocolate.

436
00:20:58,103 --> 00:20:59,071
Just look at him.

437
00:20:59,239 --> 00:21:00,207
<i>Then I realized</i>

438
00:21:00,308 --> 00:21:01,874
<i>it really wasn't
about the music.</i>

439
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:03,908
<i>And then there was
my first girlfriend.</i>

440
00:21:03,977 --> 00:21:05,812
I think I'm falling
in love with you.

441
00:21:06,479 --> 00:21:08,481
Wow. Thank you. Be right back.

442
00:21:12,118 --> 00:21:13,252
<i>Wasn't my proudest moment.</i>

443
00:21:21,494 --> 00:21:23,396
<i>How 'bout you?
How did you know?</i>

444
00:21:23,663 --> 00:21:25,698
<i>Warmly, Jacques.</i>

445
00:21:30,503 --> 00:21:31,736
<i>Fondly, Jacques.</i>

446
00:21:37,342 --> 00:21:38,243
<i>Jacques.</i>

447
00:21:51,189 --> 00:21:52,524
<i>Jacques, don't worry.</i>

448
00:21:52,659 --> 00:21:54,560
<i>If your proudest moment
happened in middle school,</i>

449
00:21:54,727 --> 00:21:56,095
<i>that would be pretty sad.</i>

450
00:21:56,661 --> 00:21:57,928
<i>For me, I realized I liked guys</i>

451
00:21:58,165 --> 00:21:58,865
<i>watching</i> Game of Thrones.

452
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:00,501
<i>My friends were all
holding their breath</i>

453
00:22:00,967 --> 00:22:03,200
<i>waiting to see
the Dragon Princess's boobs.</i>

454
00:22:03,971 --> 00:22:06,005
<i>I was crushing hard
on Jon Snow.</i>

455
00:22:06,573 --> 00:22:08,108
<i>Well,
I've never told anyone</i>

456
00:22:08,175 --> 00:22:11,010
<i>about my Daniel Radcliffe phase
so now we're even.</i>

457
00:22:11,242 --> 00:22:12,543
<i>And for the record,</i>

458
00:22:12,611 --> 00:22:13,979
<i>I think Jon Snow
is an excellent choice</i>

459
00:22:14,146 --> 00:22:14,945
<i>for your sexual awakening.</i>

460
00:22:15,147 --> 00:22:16,847
<i>So I guess, if I want
to find you at school</i>

461
00:22:16,915 --> 00:22:19,117
<i>I just have to look for
the</i> Game of Thrones <i>fanatic.</i>

462
00:22:31,097 --> 00:22:31,796
Wow.

463
00:22:32,198 --> 00:22:34,166
<i>I was just listening to that
M83 song "Reunion,"</i>

464
00:22:34,234 --> 00:22:35,468
<i>and it made me think of you.</i>

465
00:22:35,869 --> 00:22:37,770
<i>You'll probably think
my music taste is lame.</i>

466
00:22:38,305 --> 00:22:39,805
<i>Kind of have the same taste
as my Aunt Sally</i>

467
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,506
<i>who loves show tunes.</i>

468
00:22:41,741 --> 00:22:43,675
<i>Obviously, some of the things
I've told you about myself</i>

469
00:22:43,811 --> 00:22:46,278
<i>are things I've never
talked about with anyone.</i>

470
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,812
<i>There's something about you
that makes me want to open up.</i>

471
00:22:49,081 --> 00:22:50,849
<i>And that's
slightly terrifying for me.</i>

472
00:22:50,917 --> 00:22:51,916
<i>So I've been thinking,</i>

473
00:22:52,051 --> 00:22:53,686
<i>maybe I should be Jon Snow
for Halloween.</i>

474
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,055
<i>What about you?
Who are you gonna be?</i>

475
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:59,358
<i>I'm not dressing up.
For me,</i>

476
00:22:59,592 --> 00:23:00,692
<i>Halloween's all about
the Oreos</i>

477
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,328
<i>with the orange frosting
in the middle.</i>

478
00:23:04,263 --> 00:23:05,831
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey.

479
00:23:05,899 --> 00:23:08,398
Wow. Look at that smile.
You're glowing, man.

480
00:23:08,467 --> 00:23:09,367
No.

481
00:23:09,435 --> 00:23:10,435
You are glowing.
You look happy.

482
00:23:10,503 --> 00:23:11,502
Oh, just regular.

483
00:23:11,572 --> 00:23:12,738
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

484
00:23:12,806 --> 00:23:15,040
Me too. I'm a little meh.

485
00:23:16,142 --> 00:23:17,040
Why "meh"?

486
00:23:17,277 --> 00:23:20,713
Oh, I had my big Tinder date
last night. Oh, God.

487
00:23:20,847 --> 00:23:22,981
She was not into it.

488
00:23:23,481 --> 00:23:24,749
At. All.

489
00:23:26,387 --> 00:23:28,020
- Oh, come on. Too soon.
- No.

490
00:23:28,219 --> 00:23:29,420
The bell is a buzzkill.

491
00:23:29,489 --> 00:23:30,957
- See you, Mr. Worth.
- All right.

492
00:23:33,591 --> 00:23:34,959
Well, thank you
for your help, <i>Fräulein.</i>

493
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:35,728
You're welcome.

494
00:23:36,227 --> 00:23:39,697
German accent for <i>Cabaret.</i>
Yup. Take care, Ms. Bradley.

495
00:23:41,067 --> 00:23:41,966
Ladies.

496
00:23:43,471 --> 00:23:46,204
Let's see what you got,
interwebs.

497
00:23:52,613 --> 00:23:53,779
Here are
your burnt tots,

498
00:23:53,847 --> 00:23:55,781
because you have
horrible taste.

499
00:23:56,683 --> 00:23:57,682
Here's your
green banana,

500
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,184
because you like
disgusting things.

501
00:23:59,719 --> 00:24:00,619
Wow, you guys are weird.

502
00:24:00,886 --> 00:24:03,386
Yup. They're practically
Cantonese twins.

503
00:24:03,722 --> 00:24:05,658
- Siamese.
- Yeah. Siamese.

504
00:24:06,292 --> 00:24:07,025
Yeah, agree to disagree.

505
00:24:07,226 --> 00:24:08,560
I don't think
that's one of those things

506
00:24:08,628 --> 00:24:09,627
where you can
agree to disagree.

507
00:24:09,696 --> 00:24:10,597
- ...disagree.
- It's just right.

508
00:24:10,664 --> 00:24:11,864
To each his own.

509
00:24:13,298 --> 00:24:14,198
Oreos.

510
00:24:15,401 --> 00:24:16,400
Man, I love those.

511
00:24:16,901 --> 00:24:18,202
Halloween ones
are the best, right?

512
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,171
Yeah.

513
00:24:20,572 --> 00:24:21,907
Er, so, guys, I have great news.

514
00:24:21,974 --> 00:24:23,742
My aunt's boyfriend
just took off

515
00:24:23,811 --> 00:24:25,511
with her car
and all her jewelry.

516
00:24:25,578 --> 00:24:27,179
Bram, that's terrible news!

517
00:24:27,244 --> 00:24:27,945
I know, but it's like,

518
00:24:28,115 --> 00:24:29,048
the third time
it's happened to her.

519
00:24:29,116 --> 00:24:30,816
She has really bad taste in men.

520
00:24:31,383 --> 00:24:34,886
Anyways, my mom is going down
to Orlando to deal with it

521
00:24:34,954 --> 00:24:38,022
which means I get to throw
a Halloween party.

522
00:24:38,626 --> 00:24:39,992
- Awesome!
- Yay!

523
00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:40,759
Nice!

524
00:24:40,927 --> 00:24:42,693
Thank you,
Bram's dumb-ass aunt!

525
00:24:42,828 --> 00:24:44,430
All right, this is
gonna be epic, you guys.

526
00:24:44,529 --> 00:24:45,930
I can bring
my karaoke machine.

527
00:24:46,065 --> 00:24:47,932
All right, hey, guys,
Halloween party Friday night!

528
00:24:48,535 --> 00:24:50,036
Friday night, Halloween party,
okay? Bram's house!

529
00:24:50,103 --> 00:24:51,769
You really set this
in motion, man.

530
00:24:51,837 --> 00:24:52,736
I know, right?

531
00:24:52,805 --> 00:24:53,805
- Hey, little guy.
- Me?

532
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,607
Halloween party. Friday night.
Bram's house. Be there.

533
00:24:56,943 --> 00:24:58,076
You're gonna
freak him out, man.

534
00:24:58,143 --> 00:24:58,843
Yeah.

535
00:24:59,112 --> 00:25:00,211
I know.
He's, like, nine years old.

536
00:25:08,219 --> 00:25:10,654
<i>Very relieved that
we're in agreement on Oreos.</i>

537
00:25:10,724 --> 00:25:12,824
<i>That would have been
a deal-breaker for me.</i>

538
00:25:13,259 --> 00:25:17,295
<i>On a totally different,
non-cookie related note...</i>

539
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:20,263
<i>is it weird that I have no idea
what you look like,</i>

540
00:25:20,332 --> 00:25:23,502
but I can't stop thinking
about kissing you.

541
00:25:25,271 --> 00:25:27,438
Simon. Simon.

542
00:25:28,774 --> 00:25:30,008
Eyes on your own test.

543
00:25:39,618 --> 00:25:41,351
Don't stop on my account,
Rob and Brianne.

544
00:25:41,421 --> 00:25:43,355
That's the most action
I've seen in weeks.

545
00:25:43,422 --> 00:25:45,524
What do we got here? Ah!

546
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:46,723
When we're done,
it's gonna look

547
00:25:46,891 --> 00:25:49,761
like a real German sex club.
Don't ask me how I know.

548
00:25:51,096 --> 00:25:54,198
Hey! Hey! The spray paint
is for painting,

549
00:25:54,267 --> 00:25:55,200
not for huffing.

550
00:25:55,701 --> 00:25:56,900
You don't want
to get good at that.

551
00:25:57,402 --> 00:25:58,970
Okay, do you guys think
I should dye my hair grey

552
00:25:59,037 --> 00:26:00,504
- to play <i>Fräulein</i> Schneider?
- Sure.

553
00:26:01,174 --> 00:26:02,675
Really? But my hair
is kind of like my thing.

554
00:26:02,741 --> 00:26:03,975
I'm gonna go get a soda.

555
00:26:04,542 --> 00:26:05,511
Do you want anything?

556
00:26:05,744 --> 00:26:06,642
No.

557
00:26:06,712 --> 00:26:08,079
You disgust me.

558
00:26:16,588 --> 00:26:18,822
Simon! Hey, hey, hey.

559
00:26:18,892 --> 00:26:20,159
- Hey, Martin.
- Buddy.

560
00:26:20,626 --> 00:26:24,028
Hey, um, I used the computer
in the library right after you.

561
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,864
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

562
00:26:26,231 --> 00:26:29,634
Well, I went to Gmail,
and it pulled up your account.

563
00:26:29,969 --> 00:26:31,802
And I, uh, read
some of your emails.

564
00:26:31,902 --> 00:26:33,036
I know
I probably shouldn't've,

565
00:26:33,106 --> 00:26:34,873
but they were, like,
right there.

566
00:26:35,142 --> 00:26:37,242
So you'll be interested
to know my brother's gay.

567
00:26:40,946 --> 00:26:43,880
No. Martin, that wouldn't
interest me to know.

568
00:26:44,315 --> 00:26:46,149
Okay. Don't worry.
I won't show anyone.

569
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,555
Show anyone what?

570
00:26:51,156 --> 00:26:52,691
Did you print my emails
or something?

571
00:26:52,824 --> 00:26:54,892
Oh, no, no.

572
00:26:55,427 --> 00:26:56,860
I screenshot them.

573
00:26:56,961 --> 00:26:59,128
- You screenshotted my emails?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

574
00:26:59,197 --> 00:27:00,431
Let me talk to you for a second.

575
00:27:01,901 --> 00:27:03,735
- Oh, Ms. Bradley.
- Hello, Martin.

576
00:27:03,802 --> 00:27:05,469
- Did you feather your hair?
- No.

577
00:27:06,338 --> 00:27:07,239
Looking good.

578
00:27:08,442 --> 00:27:09,409
This is a good section.

579
00:27:10,777 --> 00:27:11,674
Jeez.

580
00:27:12,278 --> 00:27:14,278
Now, why the hell
did you screenshot my emails?

581
00:27:14,681 --> 00:27:17,748
Ah, well, you and Abby Susso
are good friends. Right?

582
00:27:17,817 --> 00:27:18,817
Yeah. We know each other.

583
00:27:18,951 --> 00:27:19,884
What does that have to do
with anything?

584
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,853
Well, I need you to help me
talk with her...

585
00:27:23,288 --> 00:27:25,289
and hang out with her
and stuff, you know?

586
00:27:25,525 --> 00:27:27,024
Why would I help you do that?

587
00:27:28,861 --> 00:27:29,994
Are you blackmailing me?

588
00:27:30,062 --> 00:27:32,896
Oh, shh! Okay. Don't be
so dramatic here, Simon.

589
00:27:32,966 --> 00:27:33,933
Sup, Tyler?

590
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:36,167
What's up, Tyler?
Is that a Patagonia?

591
00:27:36,836 --> 00:27:39,371
Nice. I just like her.

592
00:27:39,673 --> 00:27:42,474
And I think
that you could help me.

593
00:27:42,941 --> 00:27:44,775
Yeah, what if I say no, Martin?

594
00:27:44,845 --> 00:27:45,812
I mean, what are you gonna do?

595
00:27:46,012 --> 00:27:47,146
You gonna tell the whole school
that I'm...

596
00:27:47,913 --> 00:27:49,047
You're gonna leak my emails?

597
00:27:49,115 --> 00:27:50,815
You're gonna post 'em
on <i>CreekSecrets?</i>

598
00:27:50,883 --> 00:27:52,784
I just think
that we're in a position here,

599
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,154
where we could help
each other out is all.

600
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,254
So think about it.

601
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,191
Good talk.

602
00:28:06,865 --> 00:28:08,900
You know, I never thought
of a pepper

603
00:28:08,968 --> 00:28:10,067
as being a vegetable...

604
00:28:10,135 --> 00:28:11,102
...but it makes perfect sense.

605
00:28:11,536 --> 00:28:14,706
I like the cilantro.
A little Mexican flair, huh?

606
00:28:14,939 --> 00:28:16,238
Very creative, kiddo.

607
00:28:16,742 --> 00:28:18,744
You hate the peppers.
Don't you?

608
00:28:19,245 --> 00:28:21,312
No. The peppers are great.

609
00:28:22,715 --> 00:28:24,015
I'm just gonna get some air.

610
00:28:34,827 --> 00:28:37,627
<i>Jacques, I have to get
something off my chest.</i>

611
00:28:37,963 --> 00:28:39,097
<i>The other day, you asked me</i>

612
00:28:39,165 --> 00:28:40,332
<i>what I was wearing
for Halloween</i>

613
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,967
<i>and I said
I wasn't dressing up.</i>

614
00:28:43,568 --> 00:28:44,935
<i>I lied. Truth is,</i>

615
00:28:45,004 --> 00:28:46,538
<i>I didn't want you to know
what I was wearing</i>

616
00:28:46,605 --> 00:28:49,106
<i>because I don't want you
to know who I am.</i>

617
00:28:50,843 --> 00:28:51,776
<i>Right now, these emails,</i>

618
00:28:51,977 --> 00:28:54,078
<i>they feel like
this totally safe place.</i>

619
00:28:54,712 --> 00:28:56,912
<i>I'm just not ready
for my whole world to change.</i>

620
00:28:57,181 --> 00:28:58,415
<i>I hope you understand.</i>

621
00:29:06,123 --> 00:29:08,459
<i>Yes, Blue. I understand.</i>

622
00:29:27,113 --> 00:29:28,546
Okay, if you want me
to help you with Abby,

623
00:29:28,713 --> 00:29:29,713
you cannot eat that.

624
00:29:30,183 --> 00:29:31,383
So you're gonna help me?

625
00:29:31,817 --> 00:29:32,719
Yeah.

626
00:29:35,854 --> 00:29:38,655
Simon, that is fantastic news.

627
00:29:38,923 --> 00:29:40,891
I really think that Abby and I
are meant to be together.

628
00:29:40,959 --> 00:29:42,192
- Really? Do you?
- Mm-hmm.

629
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,527
It's not all about looks, Simon.

630
00:29:43,596 --> 00:29:46,130
Okay. So you're banking
on your great,

631
00:29:46,197 --> 00:29:48,231
blackmaily personality
to get the job done?

632
00:29:48,301 --> 00:29:50,269
- Where are we going?
- Your place.

633
00:29:50,402 --> 00:29:51,736
We're gonna see
if you have anything

634
00:29:51,803 --> 00:29:53,237
that doesn't scream,
"punch me."

635
00:29:53,406 --> 00:29:55,307
Actually, I've got swim lessons.

636
00:29:55,806 --> 00:29:56,706
Cancel it!

637
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:59,579
Okay, I just have to
call my mom first.

638
00:29:59,645 --> 00:30:02,113
She has to approve everybody
that comes in the house.

639
00:30:03,215 --> 00:30:05,150
All right. Here we go.

640
00:30:06,784 --> 00:30:09,253
All right. And here we are.

641
00:30:10,755 --> 00:30:11,821
This is where the magic happens.

642
00:30:11,889 --> 00:30:12,790
Wow.

643
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:15,626
Ooh. Correction.

644
00:30:16,163 --> 00:30:18,463
This is where the magic happens.

645
00:30:20,031 --> 00:30:21,764
I've been dabbling
in close-up illusions.

646
00:30:22,099 --> 00:30:23,099
Does Abby like magic?

647
00:30:23,469 --> 00:30:25,303
No. Martin, I don't think
she does like magic.

648
00:30:25,372 --> 00:30:26,805
But, um,
there's a really thin line

649
00:30:26,872 --> 00:30:30,106
between laughing with someone,
and laughing at someone.

650
00:30:30,576 --> 00:30:31,509
And you are that line.

651
00:30:31,575 --> 00:30:33,076
So,
if you want Abby to like you,

652
00:30:33,144 --> 00:30:34,377
what you have to do
is you have to

653
00:30:34,447 --> 00:30:35,980
make her see you
as more of a...

654
00:30:36,047 --> 00:30:37,415
As sexy Martin!

655
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:40,318
Yeah! Yeah, I could be sexy.

656
00:30:42,656 --> 00:30:44,222
You like dudes. Tell me.

657
00:30:44,524 --> 00:30:45,990
What part of me
do you find the hottest?

658
00:30:46,056 --> 00:30:48,024
- No. I'm not doing this.
- No. Come on.

659
00:30:48,092 --> 00:30:49,427
No, Martin.
I don't want to answer that.

660
00:30:49,495 --> 00:30:50,928
Look, if you said my shoulders

661
00:30:51,062 --> 00:30:53,465
I would dress to accentuate.
You know?

662
00:30:54,001 --> 00:30:55,468
You know what?
Here's your first tip.

663
00:30:55,768 --> 00:30:56,468
Ripped.

664
00:30:56,769 --> 00:30:59,771
Girls, they don't want
to read your clothes.

665
00:30:59,973 --> 00:31:01,373
I think you're wrong
about that one.

666
00:31:02,274 --> 00:31:03,442
How many of these do you have?

667
00:31:04,241 --> 00:31:07,211
Please, just stop! Hey! Stop!

668
00:31:07,579 --> 00:31:10,115
Look, I don't want your help
in changing me.

669
00:31:10,816 --> 00:31:14,385
I want your help in getting
Abby to like me for me.

670
00:31:16,954 --> 00:31:18,155
Look. Um...

671
00:31:20,026 --> 00:31:22,861
there's a party this Saturday.
At Bram's.

672
00:31:25,564 --> 00:31:27,198
Do you want to go
with my friends and I?

673
00:31:27,766 --> 00:31:28,667
Yes!

674
00:31:29,069 --> 00:31:31,036
Yes! So simple.

675
00:31:31,735 --> 00:31:33,570
Must be why
they call you Simple Simon.

676
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:35,407
Nobody calls me that, Martin.

677
00:31:36,308 --> 00:31:38,710
Hey, uh, do you want to,
like, sleep over?

678
00:31:39,144 --> 00:31:40,245
Nope.

679
00:31:50,489 --> 00:31:51,555
Oh, hello.

680
00:31:52,057 --> 00:31:53,256
Hey, what's up?

681
00:31:53,393 --> 00:31:54,794
- Nice, right?
- Nick.

682
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,560
Good?

683
00:31:55,994 --> 00:31:58,061
This is, like, a new level of
laziness, even for you.

684
00:31:58,261 --> 00:32:00,796
What do you mean?
I'm Cristiano Ronaldo.

685
00:32:00,865 --> 00:32:01,866
And you couldn't
even be bothered

686
00:32:01,934 --> 00:32:03,402
to fill in the letters
on the back?

687
00:32:03,835 --> 00:32:05,603
No, come on. Give me that.

688
00:32:06,538 --> 00:32:08,672
You are a bully.

689
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:12,141
Hey. Don't
talk about Yoko that way, man.

690
00:32:12,377 --> 00:32:14,712
Because if you do,
you're out of the band.

691
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,280
Who are you guys
supposed to be?

692
00:32:18,082 --> 00:32:19,381
John Lennon and Yoko Ono.

693
00:32:19,852 --> 00:32:21,919
Oh! I thought she was the girl
from <i>The Ring,</i>

694
00:32:22,053 --> 00:32:23,220
and you were Jesus.

695
00:32:23,389 --> 00:32:26,622
Jesus? No. Why would Jesus be
wearing a white suit?

696
00:32:26,925 --> 00:32:27,893
I don't know. You tell me.

697
00:32:28,327 --> 00:32:29,827
You're the one who decided to
dress up like fancy Jesus.

698
00:32:30,061 --> 00:32:31,294
Oh, my God. Okay. Come here.

699
00:32:31,494 --> 00:32:32,695
- Turn around.
- I'm here.

700
00:32:32,764 --> 00:32:33,764
- Turn around.
- Okay.

701
00:32:34,434 --> 00:32:35,334
- Okay.
- Is it good?

702
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:36,299
- Way better.
- Is it?

703
00:32:36,667 --> 00:32:37,934
Yeah. Now, we need to do
something about this hair.

704
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:39,069
Maybe slick it back?

705
00:32:39,239 --> 00:32:41,173
It doesn't do that.
It doesn't slick back.

706
00:32:41,807 --> 00:32:42,839
Wonder Woman in the hizzy!

707
00:32:42,907 --> 00:32:43,908
Hi!

708
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:45,542
I made up a catchphrase,

709
00:32:45,609 --> 00:32:47,310
'cause Wonder Woman
doesn't have one.

710
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,681
"Hizzy" means house.

711
00:32:49,914 --> 00:32:50,946
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

712
00:32:51,015 --> 00:32:52,216
- Right. Yeah.
- Yeah.

713
00:32:52,884 --> 00:32:54,385
Oh, Abby, you look amazing.

714
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,520
Thank you!

715
00:32:56,822 --> 00:32:58,256
Yeah. You look awesome.

716
00:32:59,091 --> 00:33:00,624
I'm gonna go make
those frozen pizzas.

717
00:33:01,127 --> 00:33:02,025
All right.

718
00:33:02,127 --> 00:33:03,428
Yeah, I'll help.

719
00:33:05,163 --> 00:33:06,496
That's a nice costume, for real.

720
00:33:06,565 --> 00:33:09,167
Thank you.
What? Cristiano Ronaldo!

721
00:33:09,234 --> 00:33:10,335
Nailed it.

722
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,102
Do you remember
when we went to school

723
00:33:12,168 --> 00:33:13,236
dressed as Charlie's Angels?

724
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,572
Oh, my God, yes.

725
00:33:14,707 --> 00:33:16,373
And Nick's balls fell out
of his booty shorts

726
00:33:16,441 --> 00:33:18,275
when he, like, dropped down
to do the gun pose?

727
00:33:19,512 --> 00:33:21,412
Mm. Do you miss
trick-or-treating?

728
00:33:21,546 --> 00:33:22,813
What, you mean
instead of, like,

729
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,680
going to loud parties

730
00:33:23,749 --> 00:33:25,083
pretending to like
the taste of beer

731
00:33:25,149 --> 00:33:26,715
and feeling too self-conscious
to dance?

732
00:33:27,318 --> 00:33:28,519
I don't know why
you feel self-conscious.

733
00:33:28,619 --> 00:33:31,053
I mean, you are very clearly

734
00:33:31,123 --> 00:33:32,691
the coolest person
at our school.

735
00:33:34,027 --> 00:33:36,428
I'm pretty sure you're
the only one who feels that way.

736
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:38,530
But thank you.

737
00:33:44,268 --> 00:33:45,370
Who's that?

738
00:33:46,138 --> 00:33:47,170
I invited Martin.

739
00:33:47,372 --> 00:33:48,973
- Martin Addison?
- Why?

740
00:33:49,108 --> 00:33:50,708
Is this a Make-A-Wish situation?

741
00:33:52,411 --> 00:33:53,511
No, he's cool.

742
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,679
Hey.

743
00:33:57,815 --> 00:33:59,250
Oh, looking sharp.

744
00:33:59,752 --> 00:34:00,452
What the...

745
00:34:00,752 --> 00:34:02,853
- Guys.
- What are you supposed to be?

746
00:34:03,155 --> 00:34:04,388
Isn't it obvious?

747
00:34:05,257 --> 00:34:07,424
Ah! I'm a Freudian slip.

748
00:34:09,494 --> 00:34:11,662
Abby. Wonder Woman.

749
00:34:15,965 --> 00:34:17,299
Just pick a song already.

750
00:34:17,701 --> 00:34:19,870
Hey, Nick, uh,
can you not rush me?

751
00:34:21,705 --> 00:34:23,205
Honestly, I can't
choose. There's so many.

752
00:34:23,274 --> 00:34:24,174
That's like Netflix.

753
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:26,277
You know, trying to pick
a film on Netflix.

754
00:34:26,579 --> 00:34:29,481
I'm like...
"Am I in an Apatow mood,

755
00:34:29,548 --> 00:34:32,182
or am I in a Billy Wilder
mood?" You know?

756
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,985
Ooh, play Drake. Yes.

757
00:34:34,152 --> 00:34:37,287
Uh, no. Drake is, like,
super played out at this point.

758
00:34:37,856 --> 00:34:40,159
You can't play out a rap god.
Doesn't happen.

759
00:34:40,226 --> 00:34:41,156
Impossible.

760
00:34:41,257 --> 00:34:42,326
First of all,
he's not a rap god.

761
00:34:42,529 --> 00:34:44,429
And second of all,
I'm looking for some Beyoncé.

762
00:34:44,496 --> 00:34:46,064
- Oh.
- I just can't find "Lemonade."

763
00:34:46,131 --> 00:34:47,965
Hey. Here's an
interesting question.

764
00:34:48,032 --> 00:34:48,731
I love Beyoncé.

765
00:34:48,867 --> 00:34:50,033
What makes you guys
feel nostalgic?

766
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,000
You do?

767
00:34:51,337 --> 00:34:52,603
I mean, I think everybody
kinda likes Beyoncé.

768
00:34:53,237 --> 00:34:55,172
Grape soda makes me
feel very nostalgic.

769
00:34:55,241 --> 00:34:57,808
- What are you talking about?
- What makes you feel nostalgic?

770
00:34:58,343 --> 00:34:59,242
Hey, Abby.

771
00:34:59,611 --> 00:35:01,578
I bet you're gonna have
the best costume tonight.

772
00:35:02,313 --> 00:35:04,315
- Thanks.
- Nah, you're welcome.

773
00:35:08,118 --> 00:35:09,218
What the hell, Spier?

774
00:35:09,354 --> 00:35:11,821
Hey, why is Nick
still flirting with Abby?

775
00:35:12,123 --> 00:35:13,057
I don't know, Martin.

776
00:35:13,191 --> 00:35:14,793
Maybe you shouldn't have
worn a dress.

777
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,759
You look like a drag queen

778
00:35:16,826 --> 00:35:18,562
rolled around
in magnetic poetry.

779
00:35:21,132 --> 00:35:22,264
Hey, Abby!

780
00:35:22,534 --> 00:35:24,233
Whenever you need a refill
of your drink,

781
00:35:24,369 --> 00:35:25,969
I'll be
your designated bartender.

782
00:35:26,136 --> 00:35:27,103
So don't worry.

783
00:35:27,339 --> 00:35:29,540
Okay. Hey, Chloe, come here!

784
00:35:29,774 --> 00:35:31,006
Yo, yo, yo!

785
00:35:31,075 --> 00:35:33,510
Hey. John Lennon?

786
00:35:33,677 --> 00:35:35,178
- Yeah. You got it.
- Nice.

787
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,449
And, um, Nick...

788
00:35:38,549 --> 00:35:41,384
- You're Nick.
- No. No. I'm Ronaldo.

789
00:35:41,452 --> 00:35:43,287
- Oh. My bad.
- Obviously.

790
00:35:43,555 --> 00:35:44,455
Who are you supposed to be?

791
00:35:44,756 --> 00:35:47,891
Oh. Uh... I am post-presidency
Barack Obama.

792
00:35:48,025 --> 00:35:50,526
So I'm just chillin' in
Hawaii, drinking Mai Tais,

793
00:35:50,595 --> 00:35:52,263
writing memoirs and hoping

794
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:53,763
Trump doesn't destroy
my legacy.

795
00:35:53,832 --> 00:35:56,099
That's awesome.

796
00:35:56,768 --> 00:35:58,836
Thanks. Now let's go
to the bar. Come on.

797
00:35:59,237 --> 00:36:00,137
Yeah.

798
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:01,270
Hell yeah.

799
00:36:02,006 --> 00:36:04,308
<i>♪ My name is

805

All right, we should

806
00:36:16,186 --> 00:36:17,087
No, thanks. I'm driving.

807
00:36:17,189 --> 00:36:18,055
And Simon doesn't
really drink.

808
00:36:18,122 --> 00:36:19,356
No, I drink. It's cool. I drink.

809
00:36:19,657 --> 00:36:20,990
- All right, that's my man.
- Really?

810
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,025
You wouldn't even have a glass

811
00:36:22,094 --> 00:36:23,293
of Manischewitz
at Leah's Seder.

812
00:36:23,362 --> 00:36:25,829
It's Halloween, man.
It's a special occasion.

813
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,530
True that.

814
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:29,066
Cheers.

815
00:36:33,337 --> 00:36:34,504
You okay?

816
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:40,011
You're good at this.
You got this.

817
00:36:43,916 --> 00:36:47,817
Abby is the hottest
Wonder Woman I have ever seen.

818
00:36:48,087 --> 00:36:48,786
Yeah.

819
00:36:49,287 --> 00:36:50,887
The shit that I would let her
do to me with that lasso.

820
00:36:50,954 --> 00:36:51,854
Oh, I know, man.

821
00:36:51,923 --> 00:36:54,424
Just, like, tie me up
with that thing.

822
00:36:54,626 --> 00:36:56,059
You're not into Abby, are you?

823
00:36:56,294 --> 00:36:57,327
No, no, no.

824
00:36:57,428 --> 00:36:59,763
I mean, it's not like I...
She's cute...

825
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:00,529
Yeah.

826
00:37:00,664 --> 00:37:01,865
...but she's just not really
my type.

827
00:37:03,101 --> 00:37:06,168
Not because she's black.
I love black women.

828
00:37:06,504 --> 00:37:08,572
Not like, you know, I have
a thing for black women,

829
00:37:08,641 --> 00:37:10,708
I just love all women.

830
00:37:13,178 --> 00:37:14,979
- Oh, oh. Oh!
- Oh!

831
00:37:15,213 --> 00:37:18,615
- Oh, hey.
- Hey! Oh, hey.

832
00:37:19,284 --> 00:37:21,819
Hey. Mm.

833
00:37:23,455 --> 00:37:25,722
- I'm gonna go ask her out.
- What? No.

834
00:37:26,224 --> 00:37:27,257
- No? No?
- No.

835
00:37:27,558 --> 00:37:29,192
- You can't ask Abby out.
- Why not?

836
00:37:30,027 --> 00:37:34,096
Because. She didn't tell you
about Jonathan?

837
00:37:34,366 --> 00:37:35,298
She didn't tell you about that?

838
00:37:35,367 --> 00:37:36,333
- No.
- He's older.

839
00:37:36,566 --> 00:37:38,668
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
- In college.

840
00:37:39,036 --> 00:37:40,570
He's really experienced.

841
00:37:43,042 --> 00:37:44,442
You know I've only had sex
once, right?

842
00:37:44,509 --> 00:37:45,407
I know that.

843
00:37:45,575 --> 00:37:46,575
You know,
it's like no one tells you

844
00:37:46,642 --> 00:37:47,644
how dark everything is

845
00:37:47,912 --> 00:37:50,346
and how slippery everything
gets, and, you know,

846
00:37:50,413 --> 00:37:51,448
the parts you think
are the right parts

847
00:37:51,515 --> 00:37:52,783
are actually
the wrong parts and...

848
00:37:54,585 --> 00:37:56,653
All right, I'm gonna go eat
my feelings away.

849
00:37:58,088 --> 00:37:58,788
Man, I'm sorry...

850
00:37:59,057 --> 00:38:00,257
No, it's okay.
Don't worry about it.

851
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,861
Whoa, whoa.

852
00:38:08,633 --> 00:38:09,667
- Hey, Simon!
- Hey.

853
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,200
Hey, you wanna play Beirut?

854
00:38:11,436 --> 00:38:12,468
Yeah. Sure.

855
00:38:12,869 --> 00:38:14,270
We just need two more people.

856
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,807
How about you and me,
and then, um...

857
00:38:17,841 --> 00:38:18,740
I insist.

858
00:38:18,977 --> 00:38:19,978
Abby and Martin?

859
00:38:20,746 --> 00:38:21,878
- Okay, cool.
- Hey, Martin.

860
00:38:21,947 --> 00:38:23,146
- Yeah.
- Abby.

861
00:38:23,481 --> 00:38:24,381
Let's play Beirut.

862
00:38:24,516 --> 00:38:25,915
- No, I don't...
- Yeah. Let's do it.

863
00:38:26,051 --> 00:38:28,619
Come on, let's go.
It'll be fun. It'll be fun.

864
00:38:28,787 --> 00:38:30,920
Good old competition.

865
00:38:31,387 --> 00:38:32,889
- Ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

866
00:38:34,126 --> 00:38:35,525
Beirut. Right?

867
00:38:35,593 --> 00:38:36,527
Yes!

868
00:38:36,727 --> 00:38:38,428
Okay. Have you ever played
Beirut before?

869
00:38:38,763 --> 00:38:40,096
Uh, totally. Yeah.

870
00:38:40,664 --> 00:38:43,800
Great. All right, so,
two reracks, no blowing

871
00:38:43,869 --> 00:38:44,834
and two balls in the cup means

872
00:38:44,903 --> 00:38:46,135
that you have to
take three, okay?

873
00:38:46,237 --> 00:38:47,270
Okay. Cool.

874
00:38:47,739 --> 00:38:49,639
I thought we were talking
about a different game.

875
00:38:50,074 --> 00:38:51,205
We'll just explain
as we go. Okay?

876
00:38:51,276 --> 00:38:52,176
- Yeah.
- Okay. Got it.

877
00:38:52,376 --> 00:38:53,276
Ready?

878
00:38:53,412 --> 00:38:55,746
- Maybe you should take these...
- Oh.

879
00:38:56,714 --> 00:38:59,181
- You'll see better. Right?
- Good idea. Yeah.

880
00:39:00,218 --> 00:39:01,618
- All you.
- Raindrop!

881
00:39:01,687 --> 00:39:03,354
Here we go, all right.
You got this one.

882
00:39:03,687 --> 00:39:05,186
Oh, is that...
This is mine to drink?

883
00:39:07,858 --> 00:39:08,759
God.

884
00:39:09,994 --> 00:39:10,893
Oh!

885
00:39:12,596 --> 00:39:13,497
All right.

886
00:39:13,564 --> 00:39:15,231
Chug! Chug! Chug!

887
00:39:17,434 --> 00:39:19,067
Do we need a handshake?
Is that...

888
00:39:19,371 --> 00:39:20,304
You get one of these in

889
00:39:20,404 --> 00:39:21,939
and we can totally have
a handshake.

890
00:39:22,607 --> 00:39:23,940
Fly it away. Fly it away.

891
00:39:25,309 --> 00:39:27,043
Chug, chug, chug.

892
00:39:27,378 --> 00:39:28,445
- Sweet!
- All right.

Sorry.

912

00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:13,816

- Oh, my God!

923
00:41:39,477 --> 00:41:40,376
Wait, what?

924
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:43,045

926
00:41:45,982 --> 00:41:47,917
I need you to think of
something really sad...

927
00:41:47,984 --> 00:41:48,684
Uh-huh.

928
00:41:48,986 --> 00:41:50,819
Like, the documentary
about how all the whales

929
00:41:50,887 --> 00:41:51,988
hate living at SeaWorld.

930
00:41:52,055 --> 00:41:52,756
Too sad!

931
00:41:52,923 --> 00:41:53,989
God. Okay, then just,
you know what,

932
00:41:54,057 --> 00:41:54,991
don't say anything at all...

933
00:41:55,259 --> 00:41:57,560
And we'll ditch the barf shirt
till tomorrow.

934
00:41:57,629 --> 00:41:58,730
Okay.

935
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:00,829
- Si?
- Yeah.

936
00:42:01,032 --> 00:42:02,832
Just as little
as possible,

937
00:42:02,901 --> 00:42:04,135
say as little as possible.

938
00:42:12,843 --> 00:42:14,243
So how does that work?

939
00:42:14,312 --> 00:42:16,346
I know, I remember
when I went to...

940
00:42:16,681 --> 00:42:17,882
Hey, guys!

941
00:42:18,617 --> 00:42:20,383
- Hey!
- Hey!

942
00:42:20,616 --> 00:42:21,750
- Come talk to us.
- Hey!

943
00:42:21,884 --> 00:42:23,953
- How was the party?
- It was really fun.

944
00:42:24,187 --> 00:42:25,086
- Was it?
- Yeah.

945
00:42:25,489 --> 00:42:26,389
Aces.

946
00:42:27,492 --> 00:42:29,861
Huh.

947
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,228
Uh, well. Thanks for
letting me stay over.

948
00:42:33,297 --> 00:42:34,897
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

949
00:42:35,164 --> 00:42:36,499
You've been
staying over 10 years.

950
00:42:37,601 --> 00:42:38,735
You don't have to thank us.

951
00:42:38,802 --> 00:42:40,902
Oh. Yeah, thanks.

952
00:42:41,571 --> 00:42:43,005
Stop. Shh!

953
00:42:47,044 --> 00:42:48,378
John Lennon was wearing
a woman's sweater.

954
00:42:48,445 --> 00:42:49,812
- Mm.
- And he's drunk.

955
00:42:50,214 --> 00:42:51,781
- Definitely.
- So how do we feel about that?

956
00:42:51,848 --> 00:42:53,583
Well, he didn't drive drunk,

957
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:55,283
and he's home
before curfew, so...

958
00:42:55,919 --> 00:42:58,021
Good. That's what I thought
we thought.

959
00:42:58,088 --> 00:42:59,954
Yeah, that's what
we think, right?

960
00:43:00,025 --> 00:43:01,559
- Yeah. We're good parents.
- Yeah, we're good parents.

961
00:43:01,625 --> 00:43:02,525
Right?

962
00:43:07,531 --> 00:43:08,832
The room stopped spinning.

963
00:43:19,976 --> 00:43:21,243
Do you ever feel weird?

964
00:43:23,247 --> 00:43:25,281
- Weird?
- Yeah.

965
00:43:28,453 --> 00:43:30,887
Sometimes I feel like
I'm always on the outside.

966
00:43:34,858 --> 00:43:35,957
What do you mean?

967
00:43:36,493 --> 00:43:38,196
Like tonight, you know...

968
00:43:38,764 --> 00:43:40,729
I was at that party,
and it was fun, but...

969
00:43:41,298 --> 00:43:44,067
it kinda felt like
I was watching it

970
00:43:44,133 --> 00:43:45,266
from across the room.

971
00:43:47,971 --> 00:43:49,572
I don't know,
there's this invisible line

972
00:43:49,641 --> 00:43:50,540
that I have to cross

973
00:43:50,673 --> 00:43:51,674
to really be a part
of everything

974
00:43:51,741 --> 00:43:53,410
and I just,
I can't ever cross it.

975
00:43:56,012 --> 00:43:57,847
I feel that way
sometimes, too.

976
00:43:58,817 --> 00:43:59,815
Not tonight you didn't.

977
00:44:00,049 --> 00:44:01,618
Yeah, I was trying something.

978
00:44:03,087 --> 00:44:04,689
Yeah, sometimes I think
it'd be so much easier

979
00:44:04,756 --> 00:44:07,356
to be one of these people who
can just take a few shots

980
00:44:07,425 --> 00:44:09,392
and then hook up
with whoever's closest.

981
00:44:11,562 --> 00:44:13,130
Yeah, I guess I'm just unlucky.

982
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:14,231
Unlucky?

983
00:44:16,066 --> 00:44:16,967
Why?

984
00:44:18,035 --> 00:44:20,237
Because I'm not
a casual person.

985
00:44:21,705 --> 00:44:23,908
What kind of person are you?

986
00:44:28,845 --> 00:44:29,944
I think I'm the kind of person

987
00:44:30,012 --> 00:44:32,014
who is destined
to care so much

988
00:44:32,081 --> 00:44:34,083
about one person,
it nearly kills me.

989
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:40,389
Me too.

990
00:44:48,399 --> 00:44:49,299
It's getting late.

991
00:45:05,516 --> 00:45:06,416
Si?

992
00:45:07,484 --> 00:45:08,384
Yeah?

993
00:45:08,587 --> 00:45:09,487
Good night.

994
00:45:11,521 --> 00:45:12,421
Good night.

995
00:45:34,444 --> 00:45:35,344
<i>Dear Blue,</i>

996
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:37,881
<i>so one of my friends
likes the other,</i>

997
00:45:38,481 --> 00:45:41,549
<i>and he has no idea.
I guess we all have secrets.</i>

998
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:43,686
<i>Anyway, I've been
thinking about</i>

999
00:45:43,754 --> 00:45:45,155
<i>why I haven't come out yet.</i>

1000
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:47,523
<i>Maybe it's because
it doesn't seem fair</i>

1001
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:49,659
<i>that only gay people
have to come out.</i>

1002
00:45:49,726 --> 00:45:51,160
<i>Why is straight the default?</i>

1003
00:45:52,062 --> 00:45:53,329
I have something
I need to tell you.

1004
00:45:53,632 --> 00:45:56,332
Mom, there's something
I have to tell you.

1005
00:45:56,534 --> 00:45:57,434
Can we talk?

1006
00:45:57,501 --> 00:45:58,435
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

1007
00:45:59,037 --> 00:45:59,935
I'm straight.

1008
00:46:00,002 --> 00:46:00,902
I'm straight.

1009
00:46:01,103 --> 00:46:02,739
I'm sorry, Mom, it's true.

1010
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:04,439
I like girls.

1011
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:07,810
I like men.

1012
00:46:07,945 --> 00:46:09,312
You get that
from your daddy's side.

1013
00:46:10,112 --> 00:46:11,647
I'm in love with Nick.

1014
00:46:13,916 --> 00:46:15,616
I feel like I've been raising
a stranger.

1015
00:46:15,687 --> 00:46:17,421
Yes, absolutely, you have.

1016
00:46:17,687 --> 00:46:18,720
I'm heterosexual.

1017
00:46:18,857 --> 00:46:21,591
Oh, God. Help me, Jesus. Please.

1018
00:46:21,757 --> 00:46:23,524
<i>Or maybe it's because
I can't be sure</i>

1019
00:46:23,594 --> 00:46:25,393
<i>this whole "being gay" thing
is forever.</i>

1020
00:46:25,462 --> 00:46:27,096
<i>Or maybe it's that there's
not that much</i>

1021
00:46:27,163 --> 00:46:28,064
<i>of high school left</i>

1022
00:46:28,232 --> 00:46:29,398
<i>and part of me
wants to hold on to</i>

1023
00:46:29,466 --> 00:46:31,766
<i>who I've always been
just a little longer.</i>

1024
00:46:32,202 --> 00:46:34,170
<i>And then, when I go to college
in Los Angeles,</i>

1025
00:46:34,304 --> 00:46:36,071

1043
00:47:44,675 --> 00:47:46,109
Shit!

1044
00:47:50,514 --> 00:47:52,280
So, yeah,
after swimming with dolphins,

1045
00:47:52,349 --> 00:47:54,450
we fly to Saint Martin
for New Year's.

1046
00:47:55,151 --> 00:47:57,153
Anybody else,
Christmas in the Caribbean?

1047
00:47:57,787 --> 00:47:58,487
Staying here.

1048
00:47:58,589 --> 00:48:00,488
We have a classic
Spier tradition

1049
00:48:00,556 --> 00:48:02,356
of French toast
on Christmas Eve.

1050
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,360
I'm going to an unheated
vacation house

1051
00:48:04,429 --> 00:48:05,361
in the middle of nowhere.

1052
00:48:05,596 --> 00:48:07,797
As is our bleak
family tradition.

1053
00:48:08,165 --> 00:48:10,799
Ow! Ow!

1054
00:48:12,001 --> 00:48:12,900
Oh, man. Oh.

1055
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:13,870
You okay?

1056
00:48:13,938 --> 00:48:15,438
Oh, yeah, that's a paper cut.

1057
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:17,140
Overdramatic.

1058
00:48:17,641 --> 00:48:21,042
Um, Simon, do you know
where the bandages are?

1059
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:23,911
Yeah. They're just
in the supply closet.

1060
00:48:24,314 --> 00:48:25,514
Okay, do you mind showing me?

1061
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:29,618
Be right back.

1062
00:48:30,821 --> 00:48:32,288
He's like a nurse, this man.

1063
00:48:33,758 --> 00:48:35,558
Okay, I don't actually have
a paper cut.

1064
00:48:35,659 --> 00:48:37,760
I know that, Martin.
You're a very bad actor.

1065
00:48:37,828 --> 00:48:39,595
What, you think this is funny?

1066
00:48:41,231 --> 00:48:43,332
Simon, look,
I don't wanna have to

1067
00:48:43,399 --> 00:48:45,232
leak your emails, all right?
But I will.

1068
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,169
Look, you cannot
bring Blue into this, okay?

1069
00:48:48,237 --> 00:48:49,471
If he found out
that my emails got leaked,

1070
00:48:49,541 --> 00:48:51,274
he'd get totally freaked,
all right?

1071
00:48:51,341 --> 00:48:52,241
He'd never talk to me again.

1072
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:53,877
Yeah, probably not, you know?

1073
00:48:54,143 --> 00:48:55,943
The Internet's a freaky place
to meet people.

1074
00:48:56,046 --> 00:48:57,514
- Yo.
- Hey!

1075
00:48:57,581 --> 00:48:58,280
Hey!

1076
00:48:58,449 --> 00:48:59,714
- Fun movie! Freak.
- <i>Freaky Friday.</i>

1077
00:48:59,783 --> 00:49:01,784
- That's a fun movie!
- Freaky, freak, freaky.

1078
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:04,285
- Yeah, freaky-deaky Dutch!
- <i>♪ She's a super freak ♪</i>

1079
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:05,787
- <i>♪ Super freak ♪</i>
- You guys are weird.

1080
00:49:06,389 --> 00:49:08,857
I need a Band-Aid.
Those programs are a bitch.

1081
00:49:10,859 --> 00:49:13,360
Erm, yo. Martin was having
trouble running his lines

1082
00:49:13,429 --> 00:49:14,829
and we were thinking
we could go

1083
00:49:14,899 --> 00:49:17,401
to Waffle House
and go over 'em.

1084
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:19,336
- Really?
- Yeah.

1085
00:49:19,403 --> 00:49:20,502
That would be great.

1086
00:49:21,036 --> 00:49:22,270
I'm insky.

1087
00:49:24,342 --> 00:49:26,743
- Good work, Spier.
- Go to hell, Martin.

1088
00:49:35,819 --> 00:49:37,987
<i>Jacques,
if I were a betting man,</i>

1089
00:49:38,122 --> 00:49:39,388
<i>I'd say you were
drunk emailing me</i>

1090
00:49:39,455 --> 00:49:40,387
<i>during that last letter.</i>

1091
00:49:40,557 --> 00:49:42,291
<i>Don't worry. I liked it.</i>

1092
00:49:42,693 --> 00:49:44,494
<i>As for coming out,
I know what you mean</i>

1093
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,861
<i>about wanting to wait
till college.</i>

1094
00:49:46,029 --> 00:49:47,697
<i>But our emails
have inspired me.</i>

1095
00:49:48,265 --> 00:49:50,832
<i>I'm going to tell my family.
So thanks, Jacques.</i>

1096
00:49:51,336 --> 00:49:53,237
<i>Love, Blue.</i>

1097
00:50:07,918 --> 00:50:08,819
Yeah.

1098
00:50:11,287 --> 00:50:12,387
Hey!

1099
00:50:12,789 --> 00:50:15,224
- Madame.
- Oh.

1100
00:50:16,994 --> 00:50:18,528
Simon...

1101
00:50:19,562 --> 00:50:21,563
How the thespians
rehearse, right?

1102
00:50:21,631 --> 00:50:22,664
Hey, guys.

1103
00:50:23,232 --> 00:50:24,165
What can I get you?

1104
00:50:24,499 --> 00:50:27,135
Lyle! You guys know Lyle?
We have Latin together.

1105
00:50:27,304 --> 00:50:28,570
I don't think so.

1106
00:50:28,905 --> 00:50:29,771
Hi. How's it going?

1107
00:50:29,837 --> 00:50:32,540
Actually, we had Bio together
last year?

1108
00:50:32,674 --> 00:50:34,075
- Oh, really?
- It's Simon, right?

1109
00:50:34,411 --> 00:50:37,246
Yeah. Yeah, sorry,
I don't, um...

1110
00:50:37,314 --> 00:50:39,115
It's okay.
It was like a big class,

1111
00:50:39,182 --> 00:50:40,649
and I have a good memory
for faces.

1112
00:50:42,018 --> 00:50:43,217
What can I get you guys?

1113
00:50:43,353 --> 00:50:45,387
Well, we plan
on being here for a while.

1114
00:50:45,622 --> 00:50:48,324
So, we're gonna start off small
and go larger.

1115
00:50:48,858 --> 00:50:52,192
Probably get some bacon first,
some sausage. I'd say...

1116
00:50:52,962 --> 00:50:56,031
<i>"You're right. I'm much
too strange and extraordinary.</i>

1117
00:50:56,298 --> 00:50:58,899
Much! And much too distracting!"

1118
00:50:59,236 --> 00:51:00,134
Wow.

1119
00:51:00,904 --> 00:51:02,771
And you never did any acting
at your old school?

1120
00:51:03,907 --> 00:51:05,673
No. Can we get back to...

1121
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:07,407
And yet,
you're from D.C., right?

1122
00:51:07,477 --> 00:51:08,978
Yeah. Can you give me
my next cue, though?

1123
00:51:09,046 --> 00:51:10,778
So why
did you move here?

1124
00:51:11,514 --> 00:51:13,282
Because my parents got divorced

1125
00:51:13,351 --> 00:51:15,183
and my aunt found us
an apartment in her building.

1126
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:16,384
Why'd they get divorced?

1127
00:51:16,685 --> 00:51:17,585
Why does it matter, Martin?

1128
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:18,955
Are you writing a book
about girls

1129
00:51:19,022 --> 00:51:20,322
from a broken home in D.C.?

1130
00:51:21,891 --> 00:51:22,791
So?

1131
00:51:24,293 --> 00:51:26,060
I thought that my dad

1132
00:51:26,129 --> 00:51:28,997
was the greatest person
on the planet.

1133
00:51:30,467 --> 00:51:34,302
But it turns out that he's
just a sad, tired loser

1134
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:36,871
who hates his job,
drinks way too much beer,

1135
00:51:37,072 --> 00:51:38,206
and cheats on his wife.

1136
00:51:38,607 --> 00:51:41,141
To make up for all the stuff
that I just mentioned, so...

1137
00:51:41,311 --> 00:51:42,778
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

1138
00:51:43,579 --> 00:51:44,279
Yeah.

1139
00:51:44,646 --> 00:51:46,514
You deserve the father
that you thought you had.

1140
00:51:49,186 --> 00:51:50,720
You know what, Abby?

1141
00:51:52,388 --> 00:51:54,222
You deserve
a goddamn superhero.

1142
00:51:54,925 --> 00:51:57,526
Okay, thank you.
Let's get back to the...

1143
00:51:57,759 --> 00:51:58,660
Say it.

1144
00:52:00,095 --> 00:52:00,995
What?

1145
00:52:01,799 --> 00:52:02,965
I wanna hear you say

1146
00:52:03,401 --> 00:52:07,068
"I, Abby Susso,
am an incredible young woman

1147
00:52:07,737 --> 00:52:10,438
and deserve
a goddamn superhero."

1148
00:52:10,772 --> 00:52:12,841
I'm not gonna say that, Martin.

1149
00:52:13,843 --> 00:52:15,177
Okay. Well, um...

1150
00:52:15,746 --> 00:52:17,546
I won't stop until you say it.

1151
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:19,380
Okay.

1152
00:52:20,415 --> 00:52:21,949
- What are you...
- Excuse me.

1153
00:52:22,051 --> 00:52:23,886
- Waffle House patrons!
- Martin. Martin, stop.

1154
00:52:23,953 --> 00:52:25,285
- Pardon the interruption.
- Martin.

1155
00:52:25,354 --> 00:52:27,923
I would just like to say
that Abby Susso here

1156
00:52:28,158 --> 00:52:29,357
is an incredible young woman.

1157
00:52:29,426 --> 00:52:30,491
Martin, please.

1158
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,628
And deserves
a goddamn superhero.

1159
00:52:32,728 --> 00:52:35,095
- Okay, okay...
- That's right. Abby Susso!

1160
00:52:35,531 --> 00:52:37,133
Abby Susso is an incredible
young woman!

1161
00:52:37,198 --> 00:52:38,198
I'm Abby Susso!

1162
00:52:38,769 --> 00:52:41,035
Incredible young woman,
and deserves...

1163
00:52:41,503 --> 00:52:42,837
- A goddamn superhero.
- A goddamn superhero.

1164
00:52:42,971 --> 00:52:44,905
- A goddamn superhero!
- A goddamn superhero!

1165
00:52:45,207 --> 00:52:46,675
A goddamn superhero!

1166
00:52:53,215 --> 00:52:54,116
Yeah.

1167
00:52:55,051 --> 00:52:56,384
All right.

1168
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,719
Breakthrough. Yeah.

1169
00:52:59,555 --> 00:53:02,057
Okay, you can all go back
to your meals. Thank you.

1170
00:53:02,124 --> 00:53:03,726
Please sit down. Please.

1171
00:53:07,263 --> 00:53:08,164
Well...

1172
00:53:08,732 --> 00:53:11,466
Well, let's get back to...

1173
00:53:12,035 --> 00:53:14,036
- my entrance into your song.
- I'm gonna take five.

1174
00:53:15,038 --> 00:53:17,173
"Ah, the Kit Kat Klub
proudly presents...

1175
00:53:17,375 --> 00:53:18,275
I'll be right back.

1176
00:53:18,674 --> 00:53:19,673
...a beautiful woman
coming straight from England."

1177
00:53:19,675 --> 00:53:21,977
<i>Sally Bowles, everybody."</i>

1178
00:53:33,256 --> 00:53:34,156
Hey.

1179
00:53:35,757 --> 00:53:38,792
Were you in Bio when they did
that identifying leaves test?

1180
00:53:39,028 --> 00:53:41,529
Yes. And Joel Winslow
ate that poison ivy.

1181
00:53:41,832 --> 00:53:43,431
Because Doug Fogerty told him
it was pot.

1182
00:53:43,634 --> 00:53:45,201
- Right.
- Poor Joel.

1183
00:53:45,767 --> 00:53:47,568
I think he just wants
to be liked 'cause...

1184
00:53:48,338 --> 00:53:51,371
you ever notice that he has
extra pens in his backpack?

1185
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,341
Like, you know,
he's just waiting for the day

1186
00:53:54,410 --> 00:53:56,311
that someone comes up
to ask him for a pen?

1187
00:53:56,847 --> 00:54:00,114
And then he can be that guy
to give 'em a pen.

1188
00:54:01,384 --> 00:54:02,819
You see everything,
don't you, Simon?

1189
00:54:03,219 --> 00:54:04,485
I don't know.

1190
00:54:05,354 --> 00:54:06,855
But Simon means
"the one who hears"

1191
00:54:06,957 --> 00:54:09,225
and Spier means
"the one who sees"

1192
00:54:09,291 --> 00:54:11,460
so you put that all together

1193
00:54:11,527 --> 00:54:14,494
and pretty sure that means
I was just destined

1194
00:54:14,562 --> 00:54:15,963
to be up
in everybody's business.

1195
00:54:18,734 --> 00:54:19,733
I've gotta get back inside

1196
00:54:19,802 --> 00:54:21,603
and scrub down
some waffle irons.

1197
00:54:22,137 --> 00:54:24,039
- Duty calls.
- Indeed.

1198
00:54:25,174 --> 00:54:26,174
I'll see you in there.

1199
00:54:26,975 --> 00:54:27,876
Yeah, I'll see ya.

1200
00:54:43,927 --> 00:54:44,826
Hi.

1201
00:54:45,596 --> 00:54:48,264
<i>So my dad's flying in
tonight for Hanukkah.</i>

1202
00:54:48,598 --> 00:54:49,564
<i>If you are thinking,</i>

1203
00:54:49,798 --> 00:54:51,099
<i>"But Hanukkah isn't
for another month!"</i>

1204
00:54:51,166 --> 00:54:52,533
<i>Well, you are correct.</i>

1205
00:54:52,903 --> 00:54:55,103
<i>Welcome to navigating
divorced parents.</i>

1206
00:54:55,804 --> 00:54:57,138
<i>Take holidays
where you can get them.</i>

1207
00:54:57,340 --> 00:55:00,442
<i>And my dad's staying at the
same crappy motel as always.</i>

1208
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:02,710
<i>We'll do all our
horribly awkward traditions.</i>

1209
00:55:03,613 --> 00:55:05,947
<i>We'll light the menorah
and I'll silently pray</i>

1210
00:55:06,016 --> 00:55:07,884
<i>that the sprinklers
don't go off.</i>

1211
00:55:08,184 --> 00:55:09,718
<i>That's happened twice before.</i>

1212
00:55:11,187 --> 00:55:13,555
Would you believe I'm
considering doubling down

1213
00:55:13,723 --> 00:55:15,023
and turning
this whole awkward mess

1214
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:16,791
into a coming out thing?

1215
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,027
<i>Do you think I'm crazy?</i>

1216
00:55:19,995 --> 00:55:21,730
<i>No, Blue,
I don't think you're crazy.</i>

1217
00:55:22,165 --> 00:55:24,033
<i>I think you're crazy brave.</i>

1218
00:55:38,282 --> 00:55:40,949
Honestly, Martin used to
annoy the crap out of me.

1219
00:55:41,016 --> 00:55:43,285
But he's actually kind of
a cool person.

1220
00:55:45,689 --> 00:55:47,656
I've been meaning to ask you
about your parents.

1221
00:55:48,356 --> 00:55:49,590
I just didn't wanna say anything

1222
00:55:49,657 --> 00:55:50,757
when we were actually
in the restaurant.

1223
00:55:50,826 --> 00:55:52,693
I wasn't sure if you
wanted to talk about it.

1224
00:55:53,061 --> 00:55:55,328
Yeah. No, I don't mention it
a lot

1225
00:55:55,665 --> 00:55:58,100
because it kind of messes
with my image.

1226
00:55:59,102 --> 00:56:00,235
What kind of image?

1227
00:56:02,103 --> 00:56:04,071
The girl who is excited

1228
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:06,275
to start a new school
senior year.

1229
00:56:06,841 --> 00:56:09,342
Girl whose life didn't
just end,

1230
00:56:09,411 --> 00:56:10,512
like, three months ago,

1231
00:56:10,579 --> 00:56:12,981
who's angry and sad
all the time.

1232
00:56:15,585 --> 00:56:17,053
Girl who still believes in love.

1233
00:56:17,953 --> 00:56:20,921
Come on.
You still believe in love.

1234
00:56:22,057 --> 00:56:22,957
Maybe.

1235
00:56:23,559 --> 00:56:24,926
Have you ever been in love?

1236
00:56:28,697 --> 00:56:29,798
I think so.

1237
00:56:44,478 --> 00:56:45,379
Abby.

1238
00:56:46,583 --> 00:56:47,682
Yeah?

1239
00:56:51,087 --> 00:56:51,988
I'm gay.

1240
00:56:53,957 --> 00:56:54,856
Oh.

1241
00:56:57,659 --> 00:56:59,093
You can't tell anyone though.

1242
00:57:00,297 --> 00:57:01,129
Nobody really knows,

1243
00:57:01,263 --> 00:57:03,297
and I don't really want people
to find out.

1244
00:57:03,366 --> 00:57:04,899
I won't. I promise.

1245
00:57:05,235 --> 00:57:06,135
Okay.

1246
00:57:11,473 --> 00:57:12,373
You surprised?

1247
00:57:14,045 --> 00:57:14,944
No.

1248
00:57:16,312 --> 00:57:17,947
- So you knew?
- No.

1249
00:57:19,449 --> 00:57:20,715
But you're not surprised?

1250
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:23,150
Do you want me
to be surprised?

1251
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:25,819
I don't know.

1252
00:57:27,156 --> 00:57:28,057
Okay.

1253
00:57:28,857 --> 00:57:30,025
Well, I love you.

1254
00:57:31,492 --> 00:57:32,393
So...

1255
00:57:41,706 --> 00:57:42,806
Love you, too.

1256
00:57:50,813 --> 00:57:54,181
There's no one behind us.

1257
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:55,516
You don't have to put
your blinker on.

1258
00:57:55,585 --> 00:57:56,952
- Okay, just being safe.
- Yeah.

1259
00:58:10,999 --> 00:58:13,868
<i>Dear Blue, I hope
it goes okay with your dad.</i>

1260
00:58:14,168 --> 00:58:16,670
<i>Whatever happens,
you inspired me.</i>

1261
00:58:17,038 --> 00:58:18,839
<i>I came out
to my friend tonight.</i>

1262
00:58:18,942 --> 00:58:20,841
<i>And I never would have
done that without you.</i>

1263
00:58:20,977 --> 00:58:22,877
<i>Maybe we should ride
this bravery train</i>

1264
00:58:22,979 --> 00:58:24,479
<i>and reveal our identities.</i>

1265
00:58:24,981 --> 00:58:27,483
<i>I'm dying to know who you are.
Love, Jacques.</i>

1266
00:58:38,394 --> 00:58:40,361
<i>I told my dad.</i>

1267
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:44,932
<i>It was insanely awkward.
But also, kind of fine.</i>

1268
00:58:45,834 --> 00:58:47,468
<i>And you got it backwards.</i>

1269
00:58:47,936 --> 00:58:49,803
<i>It's you who inspires me.</i>

1270
00:58:51,641 --> 00:58:52,840
<i>But I'm sorry,</i>

1271
00:58:53,442 --> 00:58:56,109
<i>I'm just not ready for us to
know each other's identities.</i>

1272
00:58:56,278 --> 00:58:57,412
<i>Love, Blue.</i>

1273
00:59:01,918 --> 00:59:04,585
- Hey! What are you doing?
- I'm a fry shark!

1274
00:59:04,785 --> 00:59:06,287
Yeah!

1275
00:59:08,323 --> 00:59:10,357
- That is good.
- You're a good fry shark.

1276
00:59:10,425 --> 00:59:11,826
- Thank you, thank you.
- I like that.

1277
00:59:11,893 --> 00:59:13,093
I didn't even know
you were coming near.

1278
00:59:13,161 --> 00:59:14,060
You know
what day it is?

1279
00:59:14,361 --> 00:59:15,762
- What day is it?
- Must be Friday!

1280
00:59:15,830 --> 00:59:16,730
Oh!

1281
00:59:17,167 --> 00:59:18,834
I guess I'm being loved,
right? Right?

1282
00:59:19,034 --> 00:59:19,733
Yeah.

1283
00:59:20,369 --> 00:59:22,304
Hey, what do you get
when you get black and Jewish?

1284
00:59:22,438 --> 00:59:23,338
- What?
- Bluish.

1285
00:59:23,905 --> 00:59:25,006
That's mean.

1286
00:59:25,073 --> 00:59:25,772
Simon?

1287
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:28,776
Since when does Abby find
Martin so goddamn funny?

1288
00:59:29,543 --> 00:59:30,511
Yeah, it's crazy.

1289
00:59:30,847 --> 00:59:32,080
You know,
this is stupid.

1290
00:59:32,213 --> 00:59:33,880
I'm just gonna tell her
that I like her.

1291
00:59:33,947 --> 00:59:34,848
And I've been thinking

1292
00:59:34,949 --> 00:59:35,982
the whole
sexual experience thing,

1293
00:59:36,049 --> 00:59:37,185
it's not that big of a deal.

1294
00:59:37,286 --> 00:59:38,687
And, actually,
I've been practicing, right?

1295
00:59:38,754 --> 00:59:39,787
I got this thing online.

1296
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:40,955
It's really cool.
It's called a pocket puss...

1297
00:59:41,024 --> 00:59:42,124
Abby likes Martin.

1298
00:59:43,325 --> 00:59:44,324
She told me herself.

1299
00:59:44,759 --> 00:59:46,927
- But he's Martin.
- I know.

1300
00:59:48,598 --> 00:59:49,497
Look, I don't care.

1301
00:59:49,598 --> 00:59:50,865
- I'm gonna try.
- Hey, wait, wait.

1302
00:59:50,932 --> 00:59:52,199
What about Leah?

1303
00:59:52,935 --> 00:59:54,168
What about Leah?

1304
00:59:54,871 --> 00:59:55,971
Dude.

1305
00:59:58,141 --> 01:00:00,274
- Leah's in love with you.
- No, she's not.

1306
01:00:00,575 --> 01:00:01,509
Are you kidding me?

1307
01:00:01,643 --> 01:00:03,109
I mean, come on.
The way she looks at you

1308
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:05,814
and how she's been all jealous
ever since Abby's been around?

1309
01:00:05,882 --> 01:00:08,550
And she blushes every time
you come into the room.

1310
01:00:10,085 --> 01:00:11,586
Look, you and Abby...

1311
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:13,923
it's never gonna happen.

1312
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:15,756
But you and Leah...

1313
01:00:16,459 --> 01:00:18,327
I mean, you could be
incredible together.

1314
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:30,337
- Hey.
- What's up?

1315
01:00:32,308 --> 01:00:34,108
So I have something
to tell you.

1316
01:00:36,011 --> 01:00:37,513
Nick just asked me
to get dinner

1317
01:00:37,579 --> 01:00:38,580
before the homecoming game.

1318
01:00:40,215 --> 01:00:41,116
Okay.

1319
01:00:41,782 --> 01:00:43,950
No, like, Si, he was like...

1320
01:00:44,185 --> 01:00:45,352
He came up to me
and he's like,

1321
01:00:45,687 --> 01:00:46,688
"Do you wanna go get dinner?"

1322
01:00:46,921 --> 01:00:47,821
All right, and I was like,

1323
01:00:48,124 --> 01:00:49,423
"Sure, are Abby and Simon in?"
And he was like

1324
01:00:49,691 --> 01:00:52,961
"I was thinking it could just be
the two of us. Like, a date."

1325
01:00:53,995 --> 01:00:55,095
That's amazing.

1326
01:00:56,431 --> 01:00:57,332
It is?

1327
01:00:58,835 --> 01:00:59,934
Yeah.

1328
01:01:00,769 --> 01:01:02,035
Leah, come on.

1329
01:01:05,107 --> 01:01:06,341
I know you're into him.

1330
01:01:06,542 --> 01:01:07,442
What?

1331
01:01:08,011 --> 01:01:09,209
All that stuff
that you were talking

1332
01:01:09,276 --> 01:01:10,811
about the night
after Bram's party,

1333
01:01:10,878 --> 01:01:13,613
about, you know,
being so into one person

1334
01:01:13,682 --> 01:01:15,014
that it almost kills you.

1335
01:01:16,685 --> 01:01:17,986
You were talking about Nick.

1336
01:01:20,488 --> 01:01:21,388
Uh...

1337
01:01:22,156 --> 01:01:24,291
So you think
I should go out with him?

1338
01:01:25,295 --> 01:01:27,029
Yes. Yes.

1339
01:01:29,231 --> 01:01:30,131
Okay.

1340
01:01:31,598 --> 01:01:32,299
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

1341
01:01:32,702 --> 01:01:34,101
I promise you,
you're not gonna regret it.

1342
01:01:34,168 --> 01:01:35,269
It's gonna be great!

1343
01:01:38,906 --> 01:01:41,675
Let's pull out
your claws, Grizzlies!

1344
01:01:42,279 --> 01:01:45,546
Oh!

1345
01:01:50,085 --> 01:01:53,387
Simon, that Almont QB
is insanely hot.

1346
01:01:53,921 --> 01:01:55,722
We can talk about stuff
like this now, you know.

1347
01:01:55,789 --> 01:01:57,256
Yeah, I still don't know

1348
01:01:57,325 --> 01:01:58,693
if I really quite
figured out how.

1349
01:02:00,663 --> 01:02:02,798
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1350
01:02:02,864 --> 01:02:05,798
We gotta practice.
All right. Simon.

1351
01:02:06,033 --> 01:02:07,033
- Yeah?
- Do you think

1352
01:02:07,336 --> 01:02:12,105
that quarterback is lookin'
fine in those hot pants?

1353
01:02:13,543 --> 01:02:14,609
He's lookin' pretty fine.

1354
01:02:16,812 --> 01:02:18,980
No. No. No.

1355
01:02:19,414 --> 01:02:23,051
Fine! Good.
Put your body into it.

1356
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:24,817
Fine!

1357
01:02:25,187 --> 01:02:26,121
That was really good.

1358
01:02:26,187 --> 01:02:27,288
- That was so good.
- Thanks.

1359
01:02:27,656 --> 01:02:29,623
Hey, check it out.
It's the Waffle House guy.

1360
01:02:31,693 --> 01:02:32,592
Oh, yeah.

1361
01:02:33,595 --> 01:02:34,495
Whoa.

1362
01:02:35,763 --> 01:02:38,131
- Lyle?
- I don't know. Could be.

1363
01:02:38,201 --> 01:02:39,967
- I don't know.
- Do you think he's...

1364
01:02:40,035 --> 01:02:41,235
I don't know.

1365
01:02:42,204 --> 01:02:43,537
Okay, well,
you should talk to him.

1366
01:02:43,606 --> 01:02:44,605
I'm gonna go get a coffee.

1367
01:02:44,672 --> 01:02:46,239
Look, you are fine!

1368
01:02:46,574 --> 01:02:47,576
You got this.

1369
01:02:48,478 --> 01:02:49,377
Hi.

1370
01:02:50,945 --> 01:02:53,380
Hey. If it isn't
my favorite waiter.

1371
01:02:53,582 --> 01:02:56,616
Ah, there he is.
The guy who sees everything.

1372
01:02:56,886 --> 01:02:57,853
Yeah.

1373
01:02:58,286 --> 01:03:00,086
Hey, I wouldn't have taken you
for a homecoming guy.

1374
01:03:00,187 --> 01:03:01,454
Oh, just here for the coffee.

1375
01:03:01,790 --> 01:03:04,123
Of course. Yeah, it's all
about the cappuccinos

1376
01:03:04,192 --> 01:03:05,693
and camaraderie for this guy.

1377
01:03:11,866 --> 01:03:12,767
I'm glad you're here.

1378
01:03:13,969 --> 01:03:15,068
You are?

1379
01:03:15,737 --> 01:03:16,637
Yeah.

1380
01:03:17,438 --> 01:03:19,338
'Cause I wanted to
ask you something.

1381
01:03:21,042 --> 01:03:22,176
I was gonna ask you
the other day

1382
01:03:22,245 --> 01:03:24,711
and then I was, like,
too chickenshit.

1383
01:03:27,014 --> 01:03:28,248
What's Abby's deal?

1384
01:03:30,351 --> 01:03:31,884
I know you and her
hang out a lot.

1385
01:03:31,953 --> 01:03:33,787
Are the two of you
like a thing, or...

1386
01:03:34,789 --> 01:03:35,689
No.

1387
01:03:36,224 --> 01:03:38,124
No, uh, we're just friends.

1388
01:03:38,461 --> 01:03:40,228
I could never be just friends
with someone that hot.

1389
01:03:40,295 --> 01:03:40,994
Yeah!

1390
01:03:41,161 --> 01:03:42,397
Every day is a struggle.

1391
01:03:44,196 --> 01:03:46,733
I gotta go. I'll see ya.

1392
01:03:50,737 --> 01:03:52,472
Hey! You!

1393
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,740
Little birdie told me
you're into bears!

1394
01:03:59,148 --> 01:04:00,515
Dude! It's me!

1395
01:04:02,617 --> 01:04:04,217
I'm the Creekwood bear.

1396
01:04:04,988 --> 01:04:05,986
Of course, you are.

1397
01:04:06,055 --> 01:04:07,154
Thank you.

1398
01:04:07,589 --> 01:04:08,390
Not a compliment.

1399
01:04:08,591 --> 01:04:10,757
Hey, um... I figured out
my next move with Abby.

1400
01:04:11,124 --> 01:04:12,626
Great, that's good for you,
Martin.

1401
01:04:13,362 --> 01:04:15,462
I just wanted to run it by you
real quick.

1402
01:04:15,631 --> 01:04:16,964
No, Martin, look.

1403
01:04:17,466 --> 01:04:18,565
I've been helping you for weeks

1404
01:04:18,634 --> 01:04:20,133
and I am sick and tired
of helping you

1405
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:21,167
mess with my friends' lives.

1406
01:04:21,236 --> 01:04:22,302
So why don't you
just do that shit

1407
01:04:22,370 --> 01:04:23,670
that you did at Waffle House?

1408
01:04:24,139 --> 01:04:25,038
That went great.

1409
01:04:25,572 --> 01:04:27,107
So you're saying
I should go for it?

1410
01:04:27,375 --> 01:04:28,408
It's kind of a big gesture.

1411
01:04:28,476 --> 01:04:30,845
Go big or go home!
Right, Martin?

1412
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:32,847
Go big or go home.

1413
01:04:33,082 --> 01:04:35,450
I like that.
Thanks for the pep talk, man!

1414
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:37,417
Gotta get amped up.

1415
01:04:38,119 --> 01:04:39,886
Come on!

1416
01:04:46,193 --> 01:04:47,360
We're gonna take ya!

1417
01:04:47,663 --> 01:04:49,428

Why are we interrupting

1445
01:06:13,581 --> 01:06:15,916
that's a little more important

Abigail Katherine Susso...

1448
01:06:23,757 --> 01:06:26,058
when you transferred
to Creekwood High School,

1449
01:06:26,494 --> 01:06:28,696
just a short three
and a half months ago,

1450
01:06:29,830 --> 01:06:32,131
you not only transferred
into a new school,

1451
01:06:32,533 --> 01:06:35,534
you transferred your way
into a new heart

1452
01:06:36,204 --> 01:06:38,938
belonging to me.
My heart. Right here.

1453
01:06:39,574 --> 01:06:42,609
And whether it was being
your partner in pong,

1454
01:06:43,045 --> 01:06:44,712
or your Waffle House warrior,

1455
01:06:45,747 --> 01:06:46,914
I have cherished...

1456
01:06:47,381 --> 01:06:52,551
the 135,300 minutes
that we've spent together.

1457
01:06:53,121 --> 01:06:54,287
Oh, I'm sorry.

1458
01:06:54,890 --> 01:06:58,958
135,301 minutes.

1459

And I know that you're
this smart, talented

1460
01:07:03,232 --> 01:07:04,598
perfect creature.

1461
01:07:05,466 --> 01:07:10,835
And, uh, I'm just a sweaty
schlub in a bear costume.

1462
01:07:11,572 --> 01:07:13,442
But like old Bogie used to say,

1463
01:07:14,341 --> 01:07:15,842
it's a "crazy mixed-up world."

1464
01:07:17,145 --> 01:07:18,247
So, Abby,

1465
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:19,947
without further ado...

1466
01:07:22,217 --> 01:07:23,451
will you go out with me?

1467
01:07:24,886 --> 01:07:26,987

1468

Excuse me. Sorry.

1469
01:07:33,327 --> 01:07:34,993
Just say yes. Say yes.

1470
01:07:35,163 --> 01:07:36,264
Martin...

1471
01:07:37,232 --> 01:07:38,999
I am so sorry.

1472
01:07:40,066 --> 01:07:41,869
I don't feel that way about you.

No.

1475
01:07:48,177 --> 01:07:49,643
But I really like
hanging out with you

1476
01:07:49,711 --> 01:07:53,913
and I don't know, maybe we could
still be friends, you know?

1477
01:07:54,382 --> 01:07:55,549
Yeah, uh...

1478
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:58,619

1479
01:08:03,990 --> 01:08:05,659
No, no, hey, hey! Suraj!

1480
01:08:05,827 --> 01:08:08,428
Hey! No, no!
She said no! No, don't.

1481
01:08:16,671 --> 01:08:18,339
Yo, I thought you said
she liked him.

1482
01:08:18,871 --> 01:08:23,276
Not the ceremonious
dove launch I was hoping for.

1483
01:08:23,578 --> 01:08:26,614
But still uplifting to free
some birds.

1484
01:08:27,015 --> 01:08:27,914
Yeah.

1485
01:08:28,748 --> 01:08:29,648
Okay, uh...

1487

And way to go, Martin!

1488

1489
01:08:49,537 --> 01:08:50,738

It's true.

1572
01:12:54,881 --> 01:12:55,782
I'm gay.

1573
01:12:56,515 --> 01:12:57,616
Oh...

1574
01:12:58,185 --> 01:12:59,586
So what are you gonna do?

1575
01:13:00,654 --> 01:13:01,755
I don't know.

1576
01:13:02,255 --> 01:13:03,221
You could deny it.

1577
01:13:04,025 --> 01:13:05,759
Why the hell
would I deny it, Nora?

1578
01:13:05,826 --> 01:13:07,327
I'm not ashamed of it.

1579
01:13:07,562 --> 01:13:09,829
You've just never really
said anything.

1580
01:13:09,963 --> 01:13:10,663
So what?

1581
01:13:10,897 --> 01:13:11,964
What does that have to do
with anything?

1582
01:13:12,033 --> 01:13:13,465
What the hell
are you talking about?

1583
01:13:13,533 --> 01:13:14,834
Sorry.

1584
01:13:20,939 --> 01:13:22,040
<i>I know you're going
off the grid</i>

1585
01:13:22,109 --> 01:13:23,575
<i>and you won't see this
until you're back,</i>

1586
01:13:23,643 --> 01:13:24,643
<i>but something's happened.</i>

1587
01:13:25,179 --> 01:13:26,880
<i>You're gonna find out
who I am.</i>

1588
01:13:27,314 --> 01:13:28,815
<i>And someone posted our emails.</i>

1589
01:13:28,982 --> 01:13:31,617
<i>Please don't freak out.
Please, Blue.</i>

1590
01:13:31,953 --> 01:13:34,119
<i>I need you to promise me
you won't disappear.</i>

1591
01:14:09,924 --> 01:14:11,090
Mum,
let me open my present.

1592
01:14:11,457 --> 01:14:14,092
Honey, I'm trying to
tell you you need to shave.

1593
01:14:14,928 --> 01:14:16,328
Does that mean
you're gonna keep cooking?

1594
01:14:16,397 --> 01:14:18,464
Yeah, of course. I can
make dinner tonight, too.

1595
01:14:18,531 --> 01:14:19,463
- Awesome.
- What's this for?

1596
01:14:19,531 --> 01:14:20,432
Oh!

1597
01:14:20,868 --> 01:14:22,803
This one, Sherlock.
There you go.

1598
01:14:28,207 --> 01:14:29,207
What is it?

1599
01:14:30,611 --> 01:14:31,912
Bluetooth headphones.

1600
01:14:31,979 --> 01:14:33,646
- Do you like the black?
- Oh, I love it.

1601
01:14:33,981 --> 01:14:35,280
Because I didn't
know if you liked...

1602
01:14:35,349 --> 01:14:36,049
This is great.

1603
01:14:36,351 --> 01:14:37,451
- They have other colors.
- He said he likes it.

1604
01:14:37,818 --> 01:14:39,016
- No, I love it.
- Okay. I have the receipt.

1605
01:14:39,018 --> 01:14:39,886
He's good.

1606
01:14:46,394 --> 01:14:49,796
Actually, I did want to talk
to you guys about something.

1607
01:14:51,096 --> 01:14:51,997
What is it?

1608
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:55,201
Uh, well...

1609
01:14:55,301 --> 01:14:56,202
Let me guess...

1610
01:14:57,972 --> 01:14:59,237
you got somebody pregnant.

1611
01:15:00,606 --> 01:15:01,506
No, you're pregnant.

1612
01:15:01,977 --> 01:15:04,544
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm pregnant.
I knew it.

1613
01:15:04,610 --> 01:15:05,644
He's got that glow about him,
baby.

1614
01:15:05,713 --> 01:15:06,612
Honey.

1615
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:07,815
No. Uh...

1616
01:15:14,054 --> 01:15:14,953
I'm gay.

1617
01:15:17,258 --> 01:15:18,156
Honey.

1618
01:15:21,062 --> 01:15:23,296
And I don't want you guys to
think anything different.

1619
01:15:24,263 --> 01:15:25,163
I'm still me.

1620
01:15:25,231 --> 01:15:26,231
Of course you are.

1621
01:15:26,299 --> 01:15:27,801
- Oh, Simon.
- Yeah.

1622
01:15:28,703 --> 01:15:29,602
So you're gay?

1623
01:15:30,471 --> 01:15:32,172
Which one of your
old girlfriends turned ya?

1624
01:15:32,239 --> 01:15:34,038
Was it the one
with the big eyebrow...

1625
01:15:34,108 --> 01:15:35,175
- Jack.
- Jesus Christ.

1626
01:15:35,242 --> 01:15:36,742
Dad, can you ever
shut the hell up?

1627
01:15:36,810 --> 01:15:37,710
I'm kidding.

1628
01:15:37,845 --> 01:15:39,011
- It's not funny.
- I'm kidding, Nora.

1629
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:41,014
Just open up your gift. Please.

1630
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:47,521
It's okay, honey.

1631
01:15:47,589 --> 01:15:48,855
- Nora, I got you this.
- Simon.

1632
01:15:48,922 --> 01:15:50,322
That's for you.
No, that's for you.

1633
01:15:50,390 --> 01:15:51,289
That's from me.

1634
01:15:56,764 --> 01:15:57,898
It's a Cuisinart.

1635
01:15:59,064 --> 01:16:00,933
I love it. Thank you, Simon.

1636
01:16:04,737 --> 01:16:07,406
<i>Dear Blue,
happy New Year.</i>

1637
01:16:07,608 --> 01:16:08,775
<i>I haven't heard from you,</i>

1638
01:16:09,008 --> 01:16:11,344
<i>so I'm going to assume it's
because you have no service.</i>

1639
01:16:11,945 --> 01:16:14,212
<i>I came out to my entire family
on Christmas.</i>

1640
01:16:14,715 --> 01:16:15,649
<i>It didn't go great.</i>

1641
01:16:15,983 --> 01:16:17,115
<i>And I've been avoiding
my friends</i>

1642
01:16:17,182 --> 01:16:20,085
<i>the whole break
for all sorts of reasons.</i>

1643
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:22,054
<i>Change is exhausting.</i>

1644
01:16:22,422 --> 01:16:23,789
<i>I feel like
there's nowhere to hide</i>

1645
01:16:23,857 --> 01:16:25,890
<i>from all the newness
of everything.</i>

1646
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:27,561
<i>Except here. With you.</i>

1647
01:16:28,328 --> 01:16:29,262
<i>Please write to me.</i>

1648
01:16:29,797 --> 01:16:32,098
<i>As soon as you get
even one bar of service.</i>

1649
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:34,267
Breakfast burrito?

1650
01:16:35,302 --> 01:16:36,202
Thanks.

1651
01:16:36,369 --> 01:16:37,336
Hey, Si.

1652
01:16:39,608 --> 01:16:40,574
Come sit down.

1653
01:16:43,343 --> 01:16:44,242
I'm gonna be late.

1654
01:17:16,276 --> 01:17:17,176
Hey, guys.

1655
01:17:17,710 --> 01:17:18,977
Hey, Simon, we need to talk.

1656
01:17:19,913 --> 01:17:22,582
So Abby and I hung out
on New Year's Eve, and...

1657
01:17:23,850 --> 01:17:24,750
you see, now we're together.

1658
01:17:24,985 --> 01:17:26,920
That's awesome. That's great.

1659
01:17:26,988 --> 01:17:27,886
Yeah, it is.

1660
01:17:28,688 --> 01:17:31,022
But then we got to talking
about why it took so long.

1661
01:17:31,992 --> 01:17:33,092
Why did you tell Nick
that I have

1662
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:34,693
a boyfriend in college
named Jonathan?

1663
01:17:34,762 --> 01:17:36,396
- Why'd you make that up?
- Look, Martin...

1664
01:17:36,830 --> 01:17:37,964
he was the one who wrote

1665
01:17:38,030 --> 01:17:39,597
that <i>CreekSecrets</i> post
about me.

1666
01:17:40,033 --> 01:17:41,566
He screenshotted my emails

1667
01:17:41,668 --> 01:17:44,636
and he's been using them
to blackmail me for months.

1668
01:17:45,172 --> 01:17:47,140
What does that have to do
with us, Simon?

1669
01:17:47,974 --> 01:17:49,074
He told me
that if I didn't help him

1670
01:17:49,139 --> 01:17:51,276
get with Abby, he'd out me.

1671
01:17:54,246 --> 01:17:55,146
And I...

1672
01:17:56,015 --> 01:17:57,650
That's why I had to
keep you guys apart.

1673
01:17:57,718 --> 01:17:59,252
So you made up a bunch of lies.

1674
01:18:00,855 --> 01:18:01,788
And that's why
you convinced me

1675
01:18:01,856 --> 01:18:02,821
to go on that date with Leah?

1676
01:18:03,323 --> 01:18:04,757
You know, to keep me away
from Abby?

1677
01:18:04,926 --> 01:18:06,927
So, wait. Running lines
at Waffle House

1678
01:18:06,993 --> 01:18:08,693
and beer pong at Bram's,

1679
01:18:08,862 --> 01:18:11,195
all of that was just to
pawn me off on Martin?

1680
01:18:11,864 --> 01:18:13,531
I'm not
a piece of meat, Simon.

1681
01:18:14,334 --> 01:18:16,434
You know how hard it was
for me to start over.

1682
01:18:18,705 --> 01:18:19,972
I trusted you.

1683
01:18:24,211 --> 01:18:25,979
Hey, come on, Leah.
I'll take you to school.

1684
01:18:32,118 --> 01:18:34,886
Leah. Leah, please.
Listen, listen.

1685
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:36,287
I know I messed up, okay?

1686
01:18:36,357 --> 01:18:37,790
But I knew you were
in love with Nick.

1687
01:18:37,858 --> 01:18:39,625
- And I thought that maybe...
- Just stop it!

1688
01:18:40,594 --> 01:18:42,428
You know what? You are
insanely stupid, Simon.

1689
01:18:42,496 --> 01:18:45,697
I was never in love with Nick.
I was in love with you!

1690
01:18:49,269 --> 01:18:50,168
Look...

1691
01:18:51,437 --> 01:18:53,205
We're... We're us.

1692
01:18:53,406 --> 01:18:54,506
Yeah, well...

1693
01:18:55,009 --> 01:18:57,010
Sorry.

1694
01:18:59,277 --> 01:19:00,946
I've been trying to tell you.

1695
01:19:02,383 --> 01:19:06,384
That night I slept over,
I was trying to tell you.

1696
01:19:09,021 --> 01:19:10,789
You wanna know
the funniest part?

1697
01:19:11,592 --> 01:19:13,959
It's that all these years, you
being so picky with girls,

1698
01:19:14,025 --> 01:19:16,094
I thought that maybe it was

1699
01:19:16,162 --> 01:19:18,295
because you might
like me, too.

1700
01:19:18,898 --> 01:19:20,265
And then, you know,
you told me

1701
01:19:20,332 --> 01:19:21,232
I should go out with Nick

1702
01:19:21,734 --> 01:19:23,468
and I realized you were just
never gonna see me that way.

1703
01:19:24,870 --> 01:19:27,138
I can deal with you
being gay, Si.

1704
01:19:27,940 --> 01:19:29,475
But you set me up
to get my heart broken

1705
01:19:29,543 --> 01:19:30,976
when you thought
I was in love with Nick

1706
01:19:31,044 --> 01:19:32,578
and that just makes you cruel.

1707
01:20:02,609 --> 01:20:03,508
You all right?

1708
01:20:03,778 --> 01:20:04,678
Hanging in there.

1709
01:20:05,246 --> 01:20:07,214
Uh, for the record,

1710
01:20:07,281 --> 01:20:09,882
when I was saying that we have
a lot in common, you know,

1711
01:20:09,950 --> 01:20:12,219
I wasn't really... That's not
what I was talking about.

1712
01:20:12,685 --> 01:20:13,584
Gotcha.

1713
01:20:14,088 --> 01:20:15,288
Just FYI, just for the record.

1714
01:20:15,355 --> 01:20:16,757
- Okay, great. Thanks.
- All right.

1715
01:20:27,533 --> 01:20:28,767
Hey, Jackie.

1716
01:20:29,001 --> 01:20:29,968
Did you date me

1717
01:20:30,070 --> 01:20:31,504
because you think
I look like a guy?

1718
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:34,440
No. No, I actually
broke up with you

1719
01:20:34,507 --> 01:20:36,241
because you don't look
like a guy.

1720
01:20:36,642 --> 01:20:39,811
Oh. Oh, okay. Thanks.

1721
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:41,380
Welcome.

1722
01:20:56,595 --> 01:20:58,128
Yeah! Hey, Creekwood!

1723
01:21:00,633 --> 01:21:02,200
This one's for you, Spier.

1724
01:21:03,802 --> 01:21:04,836
Hey, Ethan.

1725
01:21:05,671 --> 01:21:06,806
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, yeah.

1726
01:21:11,010 --> 01:21:12,543
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

1727
01:21:12,613 --> 01:21:14,647
You like that,
don't you, Spier?

1728
01:21:15,883 --> 01:21:18,750
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah, Ethan, Simon likey.

1729
01:21:23,222 --> 01:21:24,589
You have something
you wanna say to me?

1730
01:21:26,293 --> 01:21:27,759
I said do you have something
to say to me?

1731
01:21:29,061 --> 01:21:30,795
- I'll take it from here.
- Hey, Ms. Albright.

1732
01:21:31,029 --> 01:21:32,197
Don't "Hey, Ms. Albright" me.

1733
01:21:32,265 --> 01:21:33,430
We're not friends.
You're not gonna

1734
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:35,068
braid my hair
or paint my nails.

1735
01:21:35,135 --> 01:21:36,702
Get your ass
off the table now!

1736
01:21:36,871 --> 01:21:39,171
You sweaty, hormonal virgins.

1737
01:21:39,504 --> 01:21:41,507
You know what? You're about to
be suspended for so long,

1738
01:21:41,776 --> 01:21:43,375
that by the time it's over,
you're gonna be

1739
01:21:43,476 --> 01:21:45,844
the fat, bald, unhappily married

1740
01:21:45,913 --> 01:21:49,213
wildly mediocre nobodies
you're destined to become.

1741
01:21:49,282 --> 01:21:50,748
You can't talk to us like that.

1742
01:21:50,984 --> 01:21:52,450
Actually, I can,
'cause I just did.

1743
01:21:52,618 --> 01:21:54,318
And you know why?
Because you're just those two

1744
01:21:54,388 --> 01:21:55,755
assholes that did
that shitty thing

1745
01:21:55,854 --> 01:21:58,555
in front of the whole school.
And guess what?

1746
01:21:58,924 --> 01:22:02,059
Nobody feels sorry for those
assholes, especially me.

1747
01:22:02,594 --> 01:22:04,896
Now, walk.
Mr. Worth's office now.

1748
01:22:04,963 --> 01:22:05,864
Bye.

1749
01:22:06,834 --> 01:22:08,033
Uh-uh. That's mine now.

1750
01:22:08,468 --> 01:22:10,803
I'mma sell it.
Get my tubes tied.

1751
01:22:27,286 --> 01:22:29,521
Why does Mr. Worth
have to talk to us?

1752
01:22:30,455 --> 01:22:32,257
I mean, can't we just
let this shit go?

1753
01:22:35,863 --> 01:22:37,230
Hey, I'm sorry, Ethan.

1754
01:22:39,466 --> 01:22:41,934
None of this ever happened
when just you were out.

1755
01:22:43,634 --> 01:22:45,503
You know what they say,
one gay's a snooze,

1756
01:22:45,572 --> 01:22:47,406
two's a hilarious hate crime.

1757
01:22:52,578 --> 01:22:54,480
You could've told me
you were gay.

1758
01:22:56,849 --> 01:22:58,549
I guess I didn't think
we had very much in common.

1759
01:22:58,685 --> 01:23:00,686
You're telling me, Simon.

1760
01:23:00,753 --> 01:23:02,553
It's not like
your all-hoodie wardrobe

1761
01:23:02,621 --> 01:23:03,722
rocks my world.

1762
01:23:10,129 --> 01:23:11,230
I don't know.

1763
01:23:11,866 --> 01:23:13,199
Maybe I was jealous.

1764
01:23:14,301 --> 01:23:15,767
You've been out
since you were 16.

1765
01:23:18,270 --> 01:23:20,005
It always seemed
so easy for you.

1766
01:23:20,239 --> 01:23:21,340
Easy?

1767
01:23:22,074 --> 01:23:23,308
Are you kidding me?

1768
01:23:26,046 --> 01:23:27,912
My mom still tells
my grandparents

1769
01:23:27,979 --> 01:23:29,280
about all the girls I'm dating

1770
01:23:29,381 --> 01:23:32,351
when we go over to their house
for dinner, every Sunday.

1771
01:23:33,253 --> 01:23:35,652
She says it's 'cause
they're old and religious,

1772
01:23:36,155 --> 01:23:37,655
and it's just easier that way.

1773
01:23:39,159 --> 01:23:40,525
I don't know,
maybe that's true.

1774
01:23:41,526 --> 01:23:44,394
But you should hear her voice
when she talks about the girls.

1775
01:23:50,001 --> 01:23:51,769
All right, boys, come on in.

1776
01:23:52,839 --> 01:23:53,739
Come on.

1777
01:23:55,174 --> 01:23:56,574
All right,
just stand right here.

1778
01:23:59,177 --> 01:24:00,278
Get up.

1779
01:24:03,614 --> 01:24:05,015
Okay, these gentlemen
have something

1780
01:24:05,085 --> 01:24:06,217
that they would like
to say to you.

1781
01:24:06,586 --> 01:24:08,252
- We're sorry.
- Our bad.

1782
01:24:08,486 --> 01:24:10,287
That's right.
'Cause at Creekwood High,

1783
01:24:10,355 --> 01:24:11,290
what do we believe in?

1784
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:12,291
Tolerance.

1785
01:24:12,624 --> 01:24:14,759
And "tolerance" means
we respect

1786
01:24:14,826 --> 01:24:16,593
Simon and Ethan's choice
to be boyfriends.

1787
01:24:16,662 --> 01:24:18,362
- We are not boyfriends.
- Yeah. No.

1788
01:24:18,664 --> 01:24:20,265
Hey, whatever you wanna
call it,

1789
01:24:20,333 --> 01:24:21,433
it's fine with me. Seriously.

1790
01:24:21,534 --> 01:24:23,601
We call it "two people

1791
01:24:23,671 --> 01:24:25,437
that are not at all
romantically involved."

1792
01:24:25,506 --> 01:24:26,940
Yeah, I get it.
Keepin' it casual, man.

1793
01:24:27,006 --> 01:24:28,339
I can dig, seriously.

1794
01:24:30,143 --> 01:24:32,943
Oh. Simon. Hey, can we talk?

1795
01:24:33,545 --> 01:24:34,579
I don't have anything
to say to you.

1796
01:24:34,647 --> 01:24:36,381
Please, please.
I just wanted to say

1797
01:24:36,447 --> 01:24:37,348
that I was sorry, okay?

1798
01:24:37,416 --> 01:24:39,183
I didn't know or think

1799
01:24:39,251 --> 01:24:40,451
that people still did
shit like that.

1800
01:24:40,585 --> 01:24:42,154
And I got in a lot of shit
for Homecoming,

1801
01:24:42,223 --> 01:24:44,656
and I wanted everyone to focus
on something else, you know?

1802
01:24:44,723 --> 01:24:46,290
I just didn't think
it was gonna be a big thing.

1803
01:24:46,491 --> 01:24:48,192
I don't care if you didn't
think that my coming out

1804
01:24:48,261 --> 01:24:49,795
was gonna be
a big thing, Martin.

1805
01:24:51,131 --> 01:24:52,298
Look, you don't get to
decide that.

1806
01:24:52,697 --> 01:24:55,066
I'm supposed to be the one
that decides when

1807
01:24:55,134 --> 01:24:56,835
and where,
and how and who knows

1808
01:24:56,903 --> 01:24:57,736
and how I get to say it.

1809
01:24:57,804 --> 01:24:59,338
That's supposed to be
my thing!

1810
01:24:59,437 --> 01:25:01,039
And you took that away
from me.

1811
01:25:02,209 --> 01:25:04,910
So, well, can you please just
get the fuck away from me?

1812
01:25:36,909 --> 01:25:39,978
<i>I saw the posts.
I know who you are.</i>

1813
01:25:40,979 --> 01:25:41,679
Jacques a Dit.

1814
01:25:41,983 --> 01:25:44,050
<i>That's what they call
Simon Says in France.</i>

1815
01:25:44,416 --> 01:25:45,383
<i>Very clever.</i>

1816
01:25:45,852 --> 01:25:48,419
<i>I'm sorry, Simon.
I can't do this anymore.</i>

1817
01:25:48,487 --> 01:25:50,321
- <i>Please, Blue.</i>
- <i>I'm so sorry.</i>

1818
01:25:50,624 --> 01:25:53,425
<i>You can't leave me alone.
Everything's falling apart.</i>

1819
01:26:45,577 --> 01:26:46,644
I mean, I haven't even
talked to her.

1820
01:26:46,712 --> 01:26:48,080
I haven't even
seen her at school.

1821
01:26:50,415 --> 01:26:52,283
Anyway, I guess
I'll see you in class, right?

1822
01:26:52,348 --> 01:26:53,548
- Yeah, totally.
- Okay.

1823
01:26:53,752 --> 01:26:54,652
Later.

1824
01:26:55,923 --> 01:26:57,756
- Hey.
- Hey, Simon.

1825
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:01,461
Is it you?

1826
01:27:03,496 --> 01:27:04,596
Are you Blue?

1827
01:27:05,463 --> 01:27:08,832
No. No, it's not me. Sorry.

1828
01:27:12,338 --> 01:27:13,972
I know you've had
a crazy couple days.

1829
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:15,041
You wanna talk about it?

1830
01:27:15,275 --> 01:27:17,374
No, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have asked.

1831
01:27:17,708 --> 01:27:19,643
- No, don't worry.
- Sorry for bothering you.

1832
01:28:00,853 --> 01:28:01,753
Did you know?

1833
01:28:07,359 --> 01:28:09,060
I knew you had a secret.

1834
01:28:14,134 --> 01:28:16,870
I mean, when you were little,
you were so carefree.

1835
01:28:18,137 --> 01:28:22,572
But these last few years,
more and more...

1836
01:28:24,042 --> 01:28:26,843
it's almost like I could
feel you holding your breath.

1837
01:28:34,586 --> 01:28:36,522
I wanted to ask you
about it, but I...

1838
01:28:37,421 --> 01:28:39,055
didn't wanna pry.

1839
01:28:42,094 --> 01:28:45,796
- Maybe I made a mistake.
- No. No, Mom, you...

1840
01:28:47,565 --> 01:28:48,932
You didn't make a mistake.

1841
01:28:53,337 --> 01:28:55,372
Being gay is your thing.

1842
01:28:56,173 --> 01:28:59,276
There are parts of it
you have to go through alone.

1843
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:00,880
I hate that.

1844
01:29:02,147 --> 01:29:05,182
As soon as you came out,
you said, "Mom, I'm still me."

1845
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,556
I need you to hear this.

1846
01:29:12,691 --> 01:29:15,260
You are still you, Simon.

1847
01:29:17,596 --> 01:29:22,363
And you are still the same son
who I love to tease,

1848
01:29:23,267 --> 01:29:26,871
and who your father depends on
for just about everything.

1849
01:29:27,539 --> 01:29:28,839
And you're the same brother

1850
01:29:29,139 --> 01:29:32,108
who always compliments
his sister on her food,

1851
01:29:32,177 --> 01:29:34,111
even when it sucks.

1852
01:29:37,749 --> 01:29:40,118
But you get to exhale now,
Simon.

1853
01:29:42,087 --> 01:29:45,656
You get to be more you
than you have been...

1854
01:29:47,759 --> 01:29:49,660
in a very long time.

1855
01:29:56,869 --> 01:29:58,903
You deserve
everything you want.

1856
01:30:13,617 --> 01:30:14,718
My boy.

1857
01:30:31,536 --> 01:30:33,136
Hey, Leah.

1858
01:30:33,470 --> 01:30:34,437
- Hey.
- What's up?

1859
01:30:34,873 --> 01:30:35,973
What are you doing?

1860
01:30:36,744 --> 01:30:38,276
Just going for a run,
you know.

1861
01:30:39,177 --> 01:30:41,412
- Daily ritual.
- Yeah, you've never done that.

1862
01:30:42,346 --> 01:30:43,246
Have too.

1863
01:30:43,748 --> 01:30:45,117
But you're wearing jeans.

1864
01:30:46,685 --> 01:30:47,617
They're my running jeans.

1865
01:30:47,685 --> 01:30:49,418
Simon, you're about to pass out.

1866
01:30:50,221 --> 01:30:52,122
Okay, fine.
I'm not going for a run.

1867
01:30:53,392 --> 01:30:55,093
Hey, Leah. Please, listen.

1868
01:30:55,161 --> 01:30:56,261
Look, I know, okay?

1869
01:30:56,330 --> 01:30:57,896
You didn't want anyone
to know you're gay.

1870
01:30:57,963 --> 01:30:59,364
No, that wasn't just it.

1871
01:31:02,901 --> 01:31:04,270
I fell in love with someone.

1872
01:31:05,805 --> 01:31:07,238
That guy in the emails...

1873
01:31:09,241 --> 01:31:10,141
I love him.

1874
01:31:11,211 --> 01:31:13,611
And I knew that if Martin
leaked our emails,

1875
01:31:13,678 --> 01:31:14,879
it'd scare him off.

1876
01:31:16,116 --> 01:31:17,015
I'm sorry.

1877
01:31:19,785 --> 01:31:21,285
I know what I did
was messed up.

1878
01:31:25,223 --> 01:31:26,123
You're my best friend.

1879
01:31:26,557 --> 01:31:27,457
If I'm your best friend,

1880
01:31:27,792 --> 01:31:29,192
then why did you come out
to Abby and not me?

1881
01:31:32,264 --> 01:31:33,163
Think it was easier.

1882
01:31:35,001 --> 01:31:36,636
I've known Abby for six months,

1883
01:31:37,201 --> 01:31:40,271
and I've known you
for 13 years.

1884
01:31:42,606 --> 01:31:43,807
And I knew that if I told you,

1885
01:31:43,875 --> 01:31:45,877
that everything
was gonna be different.

1886
01:31:47,812 --> 01:31:49,914
I really wanted things
to stay the same.

1887
01:31:54,519 --> 01:31:56,153
Tell me about this guy
you love.

1888
01:32:00,292 --> 01:32:01,759
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1889
01:32:02,361 --> 01:32:04,562
It'll help me kill off
Hetero Simon in my mind.

1890
01:32:05,196 --> 01:32:07,763
- You don't have to kill him off.
- He's dead, Si.

1891
01:32:08,133 --> 01:32:10,302
Hacking him up with
a mental machete as we speak.

1892
01:32:12,970 --> 01:32:15,005
All right. Fair enough.

1893
01:32:17,841 --> 01:32:19,042
So, I call him Blue.

1894
01:32:29,620 --> 01:32:30,855
Hey, Si.

1895
01:32:33,025 --> 01:32:33,925
Yeah?

1896
01:32:44,669 --> 01:32:45,870
How long have you known?

1897
01:32:48,139 --> 01:32:51,976
Like, I really started to get it
when I was around...

1898
01:32:54,245 --> 01:32:55,145
thirteen?

1899
01:32:55,446 --> 01:32:57,113
Four years? Four years of...

1900
01:32:58,916 --> 01:32:59,883
eating dinner together,

1901
01:33:00,052 --> 01:33:01,487
four years of
going to movies together.

1902
01:33:01,622 --> 01:33:04,389
Four years of
walking Bieber together.

1903
01:33:06,794 --> 01:33:07,893
I'm sorry.

1904
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:10,094
I shouldn't have missed it.

1905
01:33:10,463 --> 01:33:12,263
No. Hey, no, Dad.

1906
01:33:12,396 --> 01:33:13,563
All those stupid jokes...

1907
01:33:14,633 --> 01:33:15,632
Well, I know
you didn't mean 'em.

1908
01:33:15,869 --> 01:33:17,302
It doesn't matter.
I shouldn't have missed it.

1909
01:33:21,472 --> 01:33:22,371
But...

1910
01:33:22,907 --> 01:33:25,176
in case the message
got lost somewhere I just...

1911
01:33:26,845 --> 01:33:28,879
I just want you to know
that I love you.

1912
01:33:30,982 --> 01:33:32,415
And I'm really
proud of you.

1913
01:33:33,919 --> 01:33:36,087
I wouldn't change anything
about you.

1914
01:33:39,225 --> 01:33:40,424
Hey. Shit, Dad.

1915
01:33:43,426 --> 01:33:44,327
Hey, stop crying.

1916
01:33:44,561 --> 01:33:46,363
I'm trying. I'm trying.

1917
01:33:47,565 --> 01:33:48,599
Oh, God.

1918
01:33:51,202 --> 01:33:52,101
Come here.

1919
01:34:01,945 --> 01:34:03,546
How's that video
for Mom coming?

1920
01:34:03,913 --> 01:34:05,349
- Good.
- Good, good.

1921
01:34:05,418 --> 01:34:06,319
Good.

1922
01:34:09,121 --> 01:34:10,186
You don't know
how to export it, do you?

1923
01:34:10,255 --> 01:34:11,422
Can you help me
with that, please?

1924
01:34:11,489 --> 01:34:12,388
Yeah.

1925
01:34:12,825 --> 01:34:13,925
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1926
01:34:14,426 --> 01:34:15,326
Hey.

1927
01:34:15,992 --> 01:34:18,260
I thought maybe we could
sign up for Grindr together.

1928
01:34:19,331 --> 01:34:21,099
You don't know
what Grindr is, do you?

1929
01:34:22,031 --> 01:34:24,067
It's Facebook for gay people.

1930
01:34:24,636 --> 01:34:25,535
Not what it is.

1931
01:34:29,474 --> 01:34:30,172
Ladies and gentlemen,

1932
01:34:30,274 --> 01:34:32,475
I present to you
20 years of bliss.

1933
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:42,886
Did you guys do this?

1934
01:34:43,887 --> 01:34:45,388
Simon and I did it, yeah.

1935
01:34:46,325 --> 01:34:47,992
- I just helped.
- It was mostly me.

1936
01:34:48,191 --> 01:34:49,659
Yeah, right.

1937
01:34:53,866 --> 01:34:55,367
Really? Really?

1938
01:34:57,033 --> 01:34:58,602
I can't believe
you did this.

1939
01:34:59,371 --> 01:35:01,438
I panicked
and bought you a watch.

1940
01:35:01,905 --> 01:35:02,905
That's okay.

1941
01:35:03,206 --> 01:35:04,540
You can give me
somethin' later

1942
01:35:04,611 --> 01:35:05,678
that I can't get in the store.

1943
01:35:05,878 --> 01:35:06,944
That's really gross.

1944
01:35:07,278 --> 01:35:09,445
- Oh, guys, just look.
- Sorry, just pay attention.

1945
01:35:09,948 --> 01:35:11,048
Just look at baby Bieber!

1946
01:35:11,116 --> 01:35:12,216
He was so cute!

1947
01:35:12,283 --> 01:35:14,152
Just look at our baby!

1948
01:35:18,023 --> 01:35:19,956

Did you even use the ladder?

1978
01:36:21,985 --> 01:36:23,452

Yes.

- Yeah?
- Yeah!

2021

Yay!

2038
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:49,327
Yeah!

01:40:02,172 --> 01:40:04,340

2041
01:40:32,536 --> 01:40:35,472
Okay. That's your
last ride ticket, buddy.

2042
01:40:37,407 --> 01:40:38,808
Wait. Wait!

2043
01:40:42,747 --> 01:40:44,615
Simon, it's me.

2044
01:40:46,351 --> 01:40:48,719
I'm Blue. l love you.

2045
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:52,889
- No, you're not.
- No, I'm not. I just...

2046
01:40:53,956 --> 01:40:56,259
This is so brutal.

2047
01:40:57,995 --> 01:40:59,429
Here. I'll tell you what.

2048
01:40:59,798 --> 01:41:02,499
I got a couple...
How much is it?

2049
01:41:03,066 --> 01:41:06,135
- It's four tickets, four bucks.
- Perfect. Okay. There you go.

2050
01:41:06,237 --> 01:41:07,337
Last one's on me.

2051
01:41:08,905 --> 01:41:09,805
Got it.

2052
01:41:11,541 --> 01:41:13,710
Last call for the Ferris wheel!

2053
01:41:15,979 --> 01:41:18,648
Oh, no, I can't watch.
I can't watch this, babe. No.

2054
01:41:19,183 --> 01:41:20,083
This is awful.

2055
01:41:20,651 --> 01:41:22,550
- Okay, Dora.
- Wait, wait.

2056
01:41:24,289 --> 01:41:25,490
Can I sit there?

2057
01:41:26,324 --> 01:41:27,891
I was kind of waiting
for somebody.

2058
01:41:29,293 --> 01:41:30,394
Yeah, I know.

2059
01:41:35,265 --> 01:41:36,499
It's Bram!

2060
01:41:42,741 --> 01:41:43,641
It's you.

2061
01:41:45,309 --> 01:41:46,409
It's me.

2062
01:41:49,547 --> 01:41:51,115
But that night at the party...

2063
01:41:51,316 --> 01:41:53,984
Yeah.
I was drunk and confused.

2064
01:41:54,051 --> 01:41:56,918
And it ended, like,
a minute after you saw us.

2065
01:42:00,257 --> 01:42:01,390
And you're Jewish.

2066
01:42:02,091 --> 01:42:02,992
Yeah.

2067
01:42:04,063 --> 01:42:04,996
Which is cool.

2068
01:42:06,130 --> 01:42:07,530
And I'm black too.

2069
01:42:08,831 --> 01:42:09,732
And gay.

2070
01:42:11,136 --> 01:42:12,135
It's kind of crazy, huh?

2071
01:42:12,369 --> 01:42:13,537
I didn't think you'd come.

2072
01:42:14,805 --> 01:42:15,504
Me neither.

2073
01:42:16,074 --> 01:42:19,409
Until I was walking towards you,
I didn't think I had it in me.

2074
01:42:40,264 --> 01:42:41,863
Are you disappointed
that it's me?

2075
01:42:45,804 --> 01:42:46,702
No.

2076
01:43:33,282 --> 01:43:34,182
