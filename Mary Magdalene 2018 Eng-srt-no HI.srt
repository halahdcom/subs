1
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,971
<i>And she asked him,</i>

2
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,390
<i>"what will it be like?"</i>

3
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,142
<i>"The kingdom?"</i>

4
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,399
<i>And he said,</i>

5
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,193
<i>"it is like a seed,"</i>

6
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,197
<i>"a single grain of mustard seed,"</i>

7
00:01:57,284 --> 00:02:00,495
<i>"which a woman took
and sowed in her garden."</i>

8
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,041
<i>"And it grew,"</i>

9
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,250
<i>"and it grew."</i>

10
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,715
<i>"And the birds of the air
made nests in its branches."</i>

11
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,673
Maw!

12
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,052
Mary!

13
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,432
No... no...

14
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,900
Mary.

15
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:58,113
Mary! You have to tell her.
She can't cut it out.

16
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,365
There's no time for this.
You can't cut her.

17
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:01,700
She needs to push.

18
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,494
There's no point pushing.
The baby can't get through.

19
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:05,954
You have to find a way.

20
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:10,542
I can try and stretch her, but she
needs to stay completely still.

21
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,752
- Oh, no.
- Shh.

22
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,462
No, no!

23
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:15,172
- Leah.
- No!

24
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,715
- Leah.
- No!

25
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:20,969
- No!
- Look at me. Leah, look at me.

26
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,472
Look at me. Look at me.

27
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,806
You need to lie still.

28
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,184
- She's going to hurt me.
- Yes.

29
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,395
Yes, she is, but only for a
moment so your baby can come.

30
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,231
You can take it for a moment.
I know you can.

31
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,402
Look at me. Look at me.

32
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:39,029
Look at me. Look at me.

33
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,744
I'll be here with you.
I won't let you go.

34
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,662
I'm here.

35
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,837
Can you lie still?

36
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,673
- Yes.
- Yes.

37
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,848
Rachel, come.

38
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,392
Take her shoulders.

39
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,274
Hold her strong.

40
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:20,570
Keep her leg down. Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

41
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,572
You're okay.

42
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,161
Keep her still.

43
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,961
And again.

44
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,416
Can I hold the baby?

45
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:23,508
Brother, what a beautiful boy.

46
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,012
Elishai... beautiful.

47
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,725
Congratulations, Aaron.

48
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,101
Thank you, Joseph.

49
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,312
How is she?

50
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:37,981
Mary got her through.

51
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,693
The midwife says
she's a natural.

52
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,237
Aren't you all?

53
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,575
You should all
be proud of your sister.

54
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,208
"I lift up my eyes
to the mountains."

55
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,045
"From where
will my help come?"

56
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,465
Ephraim will come
and dine with us tomorrow.

57
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,175
You know him.

58
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,053
I knew his wife.

59
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,763
He's a good man.

60
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,849
His children need a mother.

61
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,769
- He's asked for you, Mary.
- You need me.

62
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,939
It would please god
for you to be a mother.

63
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,610
It would please me.

64
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,760
Is Joseph going to hear
that man speak again?

65
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,845
He's been every day this week.

66
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,473
Must be nice to have
so much time on your hands.

67
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:29,796
You're going to be beautiful.

68
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,018
Girls.

69
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,981
It's a good space.
It's warm and...

70
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,441
Our house is yours, Ephraim.

71
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,944
Enough for the family.

72
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:56,922
Here.
Put them here.

73
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,283
Yes, that's great.

74
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,789
It's good to welcome
you here at last, Ephraim.

75
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:07,000
You have
a beautiful family, Elisha.

76
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:11,045
- Children, come and meet Ephraim. Come on.
- Hello, Ephraim.

77
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,089
This healer is different.

78
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,165
I don't know. In the things
he does, the things he says.

79
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:17,844
What did he talk about?

80
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,179
A new world.

81
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,727
A just world, free of tyranny.

82
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:23,808
A holy kingdom.

83
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,520
I saw him heal a man
by the beacon.

84
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,523
The one who's always
in the market, shouting.

85
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,651
Some people have said they tried
to cast the demon out of him.

86
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,486
Who is he, then, a prophet?

87
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,197
He was with the baptist.

88
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:38,990
Where? At the Jordan?

89
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,869
John the baptist
was a true prophet.

90
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,121
You've always said that.
That's why Herod killed him.

91
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,497
That's enough now.

92
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,626
Why shouldn't we talk about it?

93
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,545
Because we don't live in
a good age for baptists,

94
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,088
or prophets,

95
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:55,757
or gossip, for that matter.

96
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,523
You need to make
many sons, Ephraim.

97
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,279
May the angels
shine down on both of you.

98
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,951
Maybe we could all
travel together for passover.

99
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,953
I try to visit
Jerusalem whenever I can.

100
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,635
Mary?

101
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:42,220
Where are you?

102
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:45,974
Mary!

103
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,230
- Mary!
- Mary!

104
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,144
Mary?

105
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,273
Mary?

106
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:39,944
Mary?

107
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,280
Tell me how to help you.

108
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,670
Go and get her father
and Daniel!

109
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,298
Mary?

110
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:07,221
Mary, tell me
how to help you. Mary.

111
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,643
Mary!

112
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,320
Shame!

113
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,852
You brought shame on our family.

114
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,067
What did you think
you were doing?

115
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:05,571
I needed to pray.

116
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,866
To decide.
"Decide"?

117
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,620
Listen.

118
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,748
You pray at the service
with the other women.

119
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,626
You pray at home
with your family.

120
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:23,673
But you don't just run into the
night like some wandering lunatic.

121
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,888
I can't marry Ephraim.
I'm not made for that life.

122
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:34,559
Then what on earth
are you made for?

123
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:42,859
You want me to bind your
breasts and shave your head

124
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,695
so you can become a man?

125
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,868
Then you can pray
whenever you want.

126
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,418
You stain our mother's memory.

127
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,506
This time, you will marry.

128
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,136
You've indulged her
for too long, father.

129
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,669
Mary.

130
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:46,255
Mary.

131
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:49,509
- Get up.
- What is it?

132
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:50,885
Father's waiting.

133
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,599
We need to show you something.

134
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:03,314
Daniel.

135
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,274
Daniel!

136
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,360
What's happening?

137
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:09,529
Go back to sleep.

138
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:11,447
Where are you taking her?

139
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:13,991
Daniel!

140
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:15,993
Mother?

141
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:17,620
Shh. It's all right.

142
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,753
Everything will be fine, Mary.

143
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:43,229
Don't be afraid, Mary.

144
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,361
What are you doing?

145
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,321
There's something
unnatural inside you.

146
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,323
Father?

147
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,742
<font color=#ffff80>Leave her, and flee outside.</font>

148
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:01,038
<font color=#ffff80>Be silent, be silent, be silent.</font>

149
00:18:01,069 --> 00:18:04,087
<font color=#ffff80>This is not your place.</font>

150
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,377
<font color=#ffff80>Come out, Demon,
come out, Demon.</font>

151
00:18:06,408 --> 00:18:08,181
<font color=#ffff80>Come out and depart from here.</font>

152
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,213
No!

153
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:11,173
<font color=#ffff80>Leave her, and flee outside.</font>

154
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:14,594
<font color=#ffff80>Be silent, be silent,
silence yourself.</font>

155
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,678
Daniel!

156
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,808
Leave her alone!

157
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,351
- Father!
- Leave her!

158
00:18:32,251 --> 00:18:33,335
Leave her...

159
00:18:33,524 --> 00:18:35,693
Stop! Stop!

160
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,438
Mary.

161
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,741
Father.

162
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,036
Please.

163
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:05,830
Let me bring the healer.

164
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,249
Yes.

165
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,099
She won't talk to me.

166
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,436
I don't know who she is anymore.

167
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,189
I'll see her alone.

168
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,286
Your family says
you grapple with the demon.

169
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:53,544
If there's a demon in me,
it's always been there.

170
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,714
I wish there was a demon.

171
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:01,635
Why?

172
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,930
What is it you fear in yourself?

173
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,644
My thoughts.

174
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:15,316
My longings, my unhappiness.

175
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:22,114
I fear that I shame my family.

176
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,367
I do shame them.

177
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,537
I'm not as I'm supposed to be.

178
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,336
What is it you long for?

179
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,219
I'm not sure.

180
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,728
To know god.

181
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,619
And yet you've felt
god's presence.

182
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:20,464
Sometimes, in the stillness,
I think I feel it.

183
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:24,718
It's always been there.

184
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,181
All it needs is your faith.

185
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,904
There are no demons here.

186
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,123
Rest now.

187
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,375
Rest in the light.

188
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:17,771
Elisha is going to see
Ephraim today.

189
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,280
He thinks the match
is still possible.

190
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:41,962
Join us!

191
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:43,631
- Come join us!
- Come, brother!

192
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:47,217
- Mary.
- Join us!

193
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:48,761
Mary!

194
00:23:58,062 --> 00:23:59,271
Mary!

195
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:08,489
Each of you stand
at the threshold.

196
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,825
Do you fear that you will
never reach the kingdom?

197
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:13,953
Whose kingdom?
Herod's kingdom?

198
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:15,496
He keeps company with sinners.

199
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,999
You know as well as I do there
is only one true kingdom.

200
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:21,835
And that is god's.

201
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,883
And god's kingdom
is taking root.

202
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,302
So we must prepare.

203
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:36,183
You must wash away the stains

204
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,768
of your corruption

205
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:41,063
and be born anew.

206
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:43,649
Like children.

207
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,569
I have been hidden for too long.

208
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:51,490
And now you hide.

209
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:55,494
Each one of you.

210
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,708
Behind the semblance
of your faith,

211
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:05,129
you recite your songs

212
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:08,215
and present your sacrifices

213
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:12,094
as if your hearts and spirits,

214
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,263
your service to god, were what?

215
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:19,226
And afterwards, you go back to your
lives and do what pleases you,

216
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:22,062
what suits you,

217
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:26,859
what makes the days upon this
earth pass easily for you.

218
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:28,235
Like dreamers.

219
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:33,073
But wake up, Magdala.

220
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,245
Open your eyes.

221
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,040
Look at the people

222
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:46,253
in Galilee and Judea suffering,

223
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:50,049
crying out for help,
for mercy, for justice!

224
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:52,092
Look at the crosses
on the hills of Jerusalem.

225
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:53,302
Blame the Romans!

226
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,179
Our holy city held
hostage to Roman jackals.

227
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,722
Jerusalem is lost to us!

228
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,349
Who will deliver us?

229
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:03,145
Can your faith be held hostage?

230
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,360
Listen.

231
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,706
In the silence.

232
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:26,835
Is there something

233
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:31,340
calling?

234
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:44,061
Do you have the courage
to follow what you hear?

235
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:52,611
Will you align yourselves
to the will of god

236
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,240
until every act of love,

237
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:02,037
every thought of care, and every
breath is taken in union'?

238
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,040
That is faith.

239
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:09,002
And that faith

240
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:14,258
will have you feed the
suffering to ease their pain.

241
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,558
And it is that faith,

242
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,021
your faith,

243
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,944
which will lead you
to god's kingdom.

244
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,576
Come. Come, Magdala.

245
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:41,994
Come to the water.

246
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,083
- Come, brother!
- Be born anew!

247
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:49,251
Join us!

248
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,921
I baptize you with water
for your repentance.

249
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,174
Into the light of god,
born anew.

250
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:59,553
By being what we are, may we
become even what he is himself.

251
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:04,433
- Come. Join us!
- Come, brother.

252
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,809
Praise god!

253
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:09,438
- Be born anew.
- Join us.

254
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,107
Come. Jesus is here.

255
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:13,859
The kingdom is coming.

256
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:17,051
I baptize you into repentance.
Into the light of god, born anew.

257
00:28:17,082 --> 00:28:17,926
Andrew join us!

258
00:28:17,957 --> 00:28:19,585
May we become
even what he is himself.

259
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:21,408
- Praise god!
- Come, brother!

260
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:25,704
I baptize you into repentance.
Into the light of god, born anew.

261
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,350
We have given nothing.

262
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:13,835
- Look.
- She can see!

263
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,338
Praise god!

264
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:19,299
The great prophet is among us!

265
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,556
He is the baptist!

266
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,475
The baptist
raised from the dead!

267
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:31,103
God is working through him!

268
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:33,605
- Please be patient.
- Don't push.

269
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,357
Please, don't push.

270
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:37,276
Be patient.

271
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,196
Stay back.

272
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,240
Please be calm.
Please be calm.

273
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,409
- Please wait.
- Please, don't push.

274
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:47,119
Move back!

275
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:50,455
Please, be patient!

276
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:52,291
Don't push, please.

277
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,505
The devil's prophet!

278
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:00,549
The devil's work!

279
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,760
- The devil's prophet!
- Rejoice!

280
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:07,556
For the kingdom of god
is coming!

281
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:10,517
There are too many!
Rejoice!

282
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,395
Come, brothers. Be born anew!

283
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:17,024
Don't push.

284
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:20,402
Stay calm.

285
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,611
Peter!

286
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:22,779
Peter!

287
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:25,292
- Don't push me. Don't push.
- Stop pushing.

288
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:28,076
Rabbi. Come back to us.
Come back.

289
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,786
- Be patient.
- Don't push!

290
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:33,123
Come away, woman.
Come away.

291
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:35,459
- Calm down.
- Be patient. Don't push.

292
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,127
Please, please, be patient.

293
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:41,131
Andrew, Andrew, hold them!

294
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,716
Stop pushing.

295
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,051
He is the devil's prophet!

296
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,542
The rabbi is leaving today.

297
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,047
All those men with him, Mary.

298
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,675
You'll be lost.

299
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,388
I'm lost here.

300
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:17,561
We are your family.

301
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:26,403
No man will touch you.

302
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:30,490
Daniel won't take you back in.

303
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:31,616
Never.

304
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:41,918
Please.

305
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:47,340
I can't.

306
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,604
Daniel!

307
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:02,355
Daniel!

308
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,108
Mary!

309
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:14,284
Mary!

310
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,123
What troubles you, sister?

311
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,633
What have you said to her?

312
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,428
What have you promised her?

313
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:36,640
I'm her father.

314
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,266
She belongs with me.

315
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,019
We've asked nothing
from your daughter.

316
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,103
Peter.

317
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:55,617
Would you separate
a daughter from her father?

318
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,994
Is that god's way?

319
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:03,458
Daughters from fathers,
sons from mothers.

320
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,378
What will you do with her?

321
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,255
She will follow him.

322
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,173
Just as we do.

323
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,428
- Come away, Mary.
- That's far enough, brother.

324
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:16,721
- I said, come away!
- Hold on.

325
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:18,890
- Stay back!
- Daniel!

326
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:20,725
Stay back.

327
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,306
What's she doing?

328
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:01,057
- Mary!
- Daniel, don't!

329
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:02,142
- Daniel!
- Mary!

330
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,603
- Mary, come back!
- Stop!

331
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:06,563
- No!
- Calm down! Calm down!

332
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:07,814
- Don't do that.
- Stop.

333
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,482
How is this god's will?

334
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,484
Huh?

335
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:15,071
No man can decide that!
No man!

336
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:16,364
Stay calm, please.

337
00:35:57,614 --> 00:36:00,241
I baptize you with water
to cleanse you.

338
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:09,584
I baptize you with light
and with fire.

339
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:16,132
I baptize you to be born anew,

340
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:19,886
awake, and ready
for the day to come.

341
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,193
She will divide our community.

342
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,904
We should welcome her.

343
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,283
Why shouldn't she follow him?

344
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,119
People will judge us.

345
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,387
Don't look.

346
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:05,390
It's easier that way.

347
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:03,323
He's talking to the angels.

348
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:09,662
We will rest here tonight.

349
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:27,305
Peter's little boy used to sit
at the rabbi's feet and sing.

350
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,600
The sweetest thing.

351
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:32,685
Hmm.

352
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:36,439
I think it broke Peter's heart
to leave him.

353
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:40,902
Do you have children?

354
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:45,657
One. A girl. Esther.

355
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:49,160
And where is she now?

356
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:50,411
In the ground.

357
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:56,000
There was a drought
in the hills where we lived.

358
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:58,294
There was hardly any grain.

359
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:02,882
But Herod still sent his
agents to take their due.

360
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:06,511
When I refused,
a Roman officer came,

361
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,638
and I had to give
my entire crop.

362
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,058
My wife was pregnant.

363
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:16,020
She didn't have the strength
to fight the hunger.

364
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,231
I'm sorry.

365
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,320
The kingdom is coming, Mary.

366
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:26,197
Soon. I can wait.

367
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:30,076
I can be patient for that.

368
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:34,455
When the dead, the beloved dead,

369
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:37,917
will rise up and walk
amongst us whole and well.

370
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:43,464
It's been promised, Mary.

371
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,758
In the kingdom,
I will see my family again.

372
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,986
What happened with
that crowd was dangerous.

373
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:07,238
He put himself in danger.

374
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:09,490
We can't risk that kind of riot.

375
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:11,868
The angels
were working with him.

376
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,828
You could see.
God was with him.

377
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:15,246
It's the miracles.

378
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:16,831
What? You question them?

379
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,708
Of course I don't
question them, Judas.

380
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:21,961
Look, we want the
people to rally, to rise up.

381
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:24,547
Slowly. Slowly,
we spread the word.

382
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:26,841
We strengthen
in numbers and then...

383
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,760
When we are sure
of the support...

384
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,094
Jerusalem.

385
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:32,472
Passover

386
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:36,434
that is where it begins.

387
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:39,020
I've never heard our rabbi
talk about this plan of yours.

388
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,688
He shouldn't have to
talk about it.

389
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,942
Because he doesn't
need to, Peter.

390
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:49,489
All he needs to do is say the word,
lift his hand, and the seas will part.

391
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,157
The Roman palaces will crumble.

392
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,993
And the heavens will rain down
blood on the oppressors.

393
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:56,454
Look, we will draw up
a strategy, huh?

394
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:58,164
An agreed strategy.

395
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:01,459
But just one word of sedition
to the Romans, Peter...

396
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,836
How many men have cried
the coming of the kingdom

397
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,047
and found their fate
lay on the execution block?

398
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:09,342
Or the cross, if someone
were to shout, "Messiah"?

399
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:12,512
By then the kingdom of David
will have truly begun.

400
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,472
I didn't know
we were to be soldiers.

401
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:19,227
No, sister.

402
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,605
We are just a group of men.

403
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:24,440
Unarmed.

404
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:26,985
And how many Roman
guards in Jerusalem alone...

405
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:30,029
The prophet spoke of peace,
a "prince of peace."

406
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:33,199
Perhaps those who have
not been with us long

407
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,702
should keep their counsel, eh?

408
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,413
Everyone should be
free to speak here.

409
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:40,331
It's not our place to judge.

410
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:43,126
But we will be judged.

411
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:09,027
When you were younger,
did you ever think,

412
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,821
if you looked away
from something,

413
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:15,033
that it may just disappear?

414
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:37,638
I'll miss the lake.

415
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:41,559
My brothers and I used to see how
long we could hold our breath

416
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:42,977
under the water in the lake,

417
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,647
how deep into the weeds
we could swim.

418
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:49,609
I loved it down there.

419
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:55,823
It was like I didn't need my body.
I didn't need the earth.

420
00:42:57,492 --> 00:43:00,995
And then I would rise up
into the air, into the light.

421
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,294
Is that what it feels like
to be one with god?

422
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,091
No one has ever asked me
how it feels.

423
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:26,938
Are they arguing?

424
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:30,149
They sounded like soldiers.

425
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,824
- Do you want to be a soldier?
- No.

426
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:42,161
Although I'm not sure
what matters to a woman

427
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:43,538
is of much account here.

428
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:45,331
Why do you say that?

429
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:49,127
The women in Magdala,
they were too afraid.

430
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:53,548
They were too afraid
to be baptized with the men.

431
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:56,801
And they can't follow you.

432
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:04,267
Forgive me.

433
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:55,127
The synagogue is
on the other side of town.

434
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:56,629
This is not a place for men.

435
00:46:13,646 --> 00:46:17,233
Well, unless he intends to
wash his robes,

436
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:19,402
- I think he means to teach here.
- Jesus.

437
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:20,569
It's Jesus.

438
00:46:20,653 --> 00:46:22,154
Because of her?

439
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:49,932
Mary.

440
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:52,393
He's waiting. Look.

441
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,158
What shall I teach?

442
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:12,496
Are we so different from men you
must teach us different things?

443
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:13,956
We are women.

444
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,542
Our lives are not our own.

445
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,672
Your spirit's your own.

446
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:26,260
And you alone answer for that.

447
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:31,307
And your spirit
is precious to god,

448
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,853
as precious as
that of your husband

449
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:37,772
or your father.

450
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:39,732
Then who should we obey?

451
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,651
If god commands one thing,

452
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:48,074
but our husbands, our fathers,
tell us another?

453
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,494
You must follow god.

454
00:47:53,329 --> 00:47:56,374
So are we to defy them
and leave our lives behind?

455
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:57,541
Yes.

456
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:01,420
Though they judge you,

457
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:06,342
persecute you,

458
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,346
you must forgive them.

459
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:12,807
Forgive them?

460
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:19,855
A year ago, a woman from Cana...

461
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:23,067
Many of us knew her here.

462
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:24,985
She was young.

463
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:28,364
Her husband found her
with another man,

464
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:32,535
and he and his brothers,

465
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:36,705
they dragged her to the river,
and they raped her.

466
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,586
And after they were done,

467
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:45,214
they drowned her.

468
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:53,973
In the court, before they were
sentenced, one of them repented,

469
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:56,142
"god forgive me."

470
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,439
But I'm not god, father.

471
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:06,026
How does it feel to carry
that hate in your heart?

472
00:49:09,155 --> 00:49:11,449
Does it lessen
as the months go by?

473
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,829
It seeps into your days,

474
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:19,081
your nights,

475
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:24,086
until it consumes everything
you once were.

476
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:27,339
Those men,

477
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,176
they too were filled with hate.

478
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:36,974
You are strong, sister.

479
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,645
But you must forgive.

480
00:49:44,607 --> 00:49:47,485
There is no other way
to enter the kingdom of god.

481
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,363
Will you join us?

482
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:55,868
Will you be born anew?

483
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:29,443
I baptize you with water.

484
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:32,488
I baptize you with light
and with fire

485
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:36,450
to be born anew, awake,
and ready for the day to come.

486
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:44,833
I baptize you with water.

487
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:48,003
I baptize you with light
and with fire

488
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:51,882
to be born anew, awake,
and ready for the day to come.

489
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:43,142
Judas, wake up!

490
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:45,728
- What?
- James, the rabbi's leaving.

491
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:46,812
What's wrong?

492
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:48,480
- Move.
- Come on, hurry.

493
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:50,124
- Mary, what's happening?
- Where is he?

494
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:42,034
You're the healer.

495
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:46,664
I prayed for you to come,
but it's too late.

496
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:28,408
Now I know that
you are the son of god.

497
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:31,161
And the people will
shout it from the rooftops.

498
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:33,539
Lazarus.

499
00:55:33,622 --> 00:55:36,959
Peter, we need to get back to
the mountains, and quickly.

500
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:38,836
No, this is what
we've been waiting for.

501
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:54,226
Rabbi?

502
00:56:14,997 --> 00:56:16,707
I saw it so clearly.

503
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,630
And now it's slipping away.

504
00:56:26,842 --> 00:56:29,177
What is?

505
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:32,514
This life.

506
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:54,953
I can feel the blood
running through your veins.

507
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:02,586
I can see light in your eyes.

508
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:05,797
You're here now.

509
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:08,258
I'm here.

510
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:10,969
Be here with me.

511
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:19,311
But the path,
it goes into darkness.

512
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:24,358
And I will walk it with you.

513
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:30,864
Jerusalem.

514
00:58:05,941 --> 00:58:07,567
Come to Jerusalem. Join us.

515
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:16,785
Spread the word.
Come with us to Jerusalem.

516
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:03,123
You've given this gift
of your faith.

517
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:07,294
And your faith lights up
the whole world.

518
00:59:10,422 --> 00:59:12,507
So I will give you
a gift of prayer.

519
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:18,180
It is the prayer of the baptist.

520
00:59:20,474 --> 00:59:23,560
It is the prayer of the humble

521
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:26,063
and the meek

522
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:29,316
and the poor in spirit

523
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:33,945
and those who hunger
to know god's true kingdom,

524
00:59:37,157 --> 00:59:40,535
the kingdom which will be
yours in the days to come.

525
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:44,831
Mary.

526
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:53,131
Go to them while they pray.

527
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:54,216
Bless them.

528
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:57,594
Be my hands.

529
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:04,935
May the lord be with you.

530
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:06,103
Lord,

531
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:11,233
hallowed be your name.

532
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:13,902
Peace be with you.

533
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:15,695
Your kingdom come.

534
01:00:16,905 --> 01:00:18,115
Give us today

535
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:21,118
the bread of tomorrow.

536
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:23,120
May the lord be with you.
Peace be upon you.

537
01:00:23,245 --> 01:00:24,830
And forgive us our debts.

538
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:31,920
For we forgive everyone
who is indebted to us.

539
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:36,675
And do not bring us to the test.

540
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:38,218
May peace be upon you.

541
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:44,474
Amen.

542
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:46,977
<font color=#ffff80>Messiah.</font>

543
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:49,396
<font color=#ffff80>Messiah.</font>

544
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:23,138
Is it beginning?

545
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:28,351
Send everyone
out to preach, heal.

546
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:31,980
Spread the message
as if I were with you, Peter.

547
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:36,443
Take Mary with you alone.

548
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:41,740
Be my apostles.

549
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:44,451
Yes.

550
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:03,386
Did he say what he saw?

551
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:06,765
I think it was a vision
of what's to come.

552
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:09,851
The kingdom.

553
01:02:12,771 --> 01:02:14,356
We need to gather more people.

554
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:17,275
Jerusalem.

555
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:19,611
Passover

556
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:22,948
that is where he'll begin it.

557
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:25,700
How?

558
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:28,828
I haven't questioned him.

559
01:02:31,957 --> 01:02:34,084
I think he's afraid to go.

560
01:02:34,209 --> 01:02:36,711
He's afraid of what
god might ask of him next.

561
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:40,048
Our rabbi fears nothing.

562
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:43,009
I'm glad for his humility.

563
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:47,597
Are you?

564
01:02:49,641 --> 01:02:52,109
There are a few hundred
people in the village.

565
01:02:52,352 --> 01:02:55,355
I'll find somewhere to teach
while you gather them together.

566
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:15,542
Romans.
We must be careful.

567
01:03:18,295 --> 01:03:20,672
They've destroyed everything.

568
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:22,465
Where are the people?

569
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:02,422
Everyone that could has fled.

570
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:05,925
Please, god, deliver us.

571
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:16,436
- Where are you going?
- They need water.

572
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:17,854
Mary, we can't stay here.

573
01:04:18,313 --> 01:04:19,314
Mary!

574
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:21,775
These people
are beyond our help.

575
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:25,487
There's nothing we can do.

576
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:37,082
We need to move to other towns.

577
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:40,126
Mary!

578
01:04:44,172 --> 01:04:46,508
We need to baptize
those who are able to join us.

579
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:50,512
He himself has...

580
01:04:50,595 --> 01:04:52,180
He himself has told us!

581
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:16,848
Mary, we must go.

582
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:18,725
It's her time.

583
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:22,729
Take the child.

584
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:28,610
Come, child. Come, come.

585
01:06:33,198 --> 01:06:35,325
Come. Peace, peace, child.

586
01:06:44,876 --> 01:06:45,919
Look at me.

587
01:06:46,461 --> 01:06:47,545
Look at me.

588
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:54,636
You are seen and heard
in every act of care.

589
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:58,890
You answer to god
with every act of love.

590
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:14,864
Stay, child. Stay!

591
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:02,287
My son was

592
01:08:04,372 --> 01:08:06,499
hiding my tools in the sand.

593
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:12,463
And suddenly,

594
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:16,384
he was there.

595
01:08:17,385 --> 01:08:18,803
Jesus of Nazareth.

596
01:08:19,304 --> 01:08:20,638
He called my name.

597
01:08:22,724 --> 01:08:23,766
That's all.

598
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:29,647
And it was like everything

599
01:08:32,442 --> 01:08:33,943
that I had in my life,

600
01:08:34,736 --> 01:08:36,070
they were like

601
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:41,576
those pictures painted on glass.

602
01:08:44,746 --> 01:08:49,751
And he became the only
real thing in the world.

603
01:08:53,171 --> 01:08:54,964
But what you did
in the village...

604
01:09:10,355 --> 01:09:11,397
Mercy.

605
01:09:20,198 --> 01:09:21,991
That was mercy.

606
01:10:23,177 --> 01:10:24,303
Who is that?

607
01:10:25,805 --> 01:10:26,973
His mother.

608
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:20,526
He sent for you?

609
01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:24,530
Why?

610
01:11:25,323 --> 01:11:28,159
Does a son need a reason
to ask for his mother?

611
01:11:32,955 --> 01:11:35,416
I used to call
for my mother in the night.

612
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:39,462
She died when
I was just a little girl.

613
01:11:41,589 --> 01:11:43,508
I would wake up
just before dawn,

614
01:11:43,883 --> 01:11:45,885
and I would forget
that she was gone,

615
01:11:46,886 --> 01:11:49,472
and I couldn't understand
why she wasn't there.

616
01:11:57,647 --> 01:11:59,106
But he has you.

617
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:11,536
He used to run to me
so often when he was little,

618
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:15,623
always getting things wrong,

619
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:19,961
crying all night because
his friends said he had

620
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:22,588
the devil in him.

621
01:12:26,677 --> 01:12:28,709
I loved him, you see, but...

622
01:12:30,404 --> 01:12:32,623
he was never completely mine.

623
01:12:36,894 --> 01:12:38,771
God must have asked
so much of you.

624
01:12:45,403 --> 01:12:48,030
What about what god
has asked of you?

625
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:50,867
To leave your home,

626
01:12:51,868 --> 01:12:52,952
your family.

627
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:58,457
And you love my son, don't you?

628
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:06,257
Then you must
prepare yourself, like me.

629
01:13:07,466 --> 01:13:08,634
For what?

630
01:13:09,343 --> 01:13:10,845
To lose him.

631
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:01,539
Rabbi.

632
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:08,671
When they see your work,
they will rise.

633
01:15:08,754 --> 01:15:10,339
Lead us, rabbi.

634
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:14,301
Lead Jerusalem to god's kingdom.

635
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:19,140
- Join us!
- The great prophet is amongst us!

636
01:15:19,223 --> 01:15:21,017
Spread the word. Join us!

637
01:15:21,642 --> 01:15:23,310
Jesus is here!

638
01:15:24,311 --> 01:15:25,354
Join us!

639
01:15:25,438 --> 01:15:27,690
Jesus of Nazareth
is amongst you!

640
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:28,941
Join us!

641
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:31,152
- Welcome!
- Good to see you.

642
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:32,486
We have spread the word.

643
01:15:33,154 --> 01:15:34,155
Will he speak today?

644
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:36,741
We have somewhere
away from Roman eyes.

645
01:15:36,824 --> 01:15:38,200
Jesus of Nazareth is here!

646
01:15:38,284 --> 01:15:39,410
Make way!

647
01:15:39,869 --> 01:15:41,162
Jesus has come.

648
01:15:41,245 --> 01:15:42,663
He has come. He has come!

649
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:45,124
- Come with us!
- Jesus will lead us!

650
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,084
Follow us!

651
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:49,837
- Jesus of Nazareth is here!
- Jesus is here!

652
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,380
Jesus will lead us!

653
01:15:51,464 --> 01:15:52,465
Rejoice!

654
01:15:53,883 --> 01:15:54,884
The temple.

655
01:15:55,634 --> 01:15:57,720
He's going
straight to the temple!

656
01:15:57,803 --> 01:15:59,472
Tell everyone.
Tell the people.

657
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:00,556
Rabbi.

658
01:16:01,015 --> 01:16:02,391
To the temple. Join us!

659
01:16:03,142 --> 01:16:04,143
Mary.

660
01:16:04,685 --> 01:16:07,229
He will bring in the kingdom
from the temple itself.

661
01:16:07,855 --> 01:16:09,690
The beloved dead will rise!

662
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:12,068
Come with us!

663
01:16:13,778 --> 01:16:16,489
It's beginning.
Wait for his sign!

664
01:16:23,871 --> 01:16:24,955
Rejoice!

665
01:16:25,498 --> 01:16:27,374
Jesus of Nazareth is here!

666
01:17:06,831 --> 01:17:09,125
Jesus of Nazareth is here!

667
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:11,544
Sent to you by god!

668
01:17:21,804 --> 01:17:24,431
Sent to you by god!

669
01:17:24,515 --> 01:17:26,308
The lord's miracle

670
01:17:26,392 --> 01:17:27,768
and wonders

671
01:17:28,102 --> 01:17:31,021
and signs sent to you!

672
01:17:31,939 --> 01:17:34,150
Jesus of Nazareth is here!

673
01:17:34,525 --> 01:17:35,860
These are the words of god.

674
01:17:36,569 --> 01:17:37,611
My dear ones.

675
01:17:40,197 --> 01:17:41,490
I'm coming to you.

676
01:17:41,574 --> 01:17:43,659
He said,
 "I will baptize you with water",

677
01:17:43,742 --> 01:17:45,744
"but he will baptize you
with spirit."

678
01:17:51,125 --> 01:17:53,002
Follow Jesus of Nazareth.

679
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:57,715
I would say, every word that
Jesus says is the word of god.

680
01:17:58,591 --> 01:18:00,217
Words of god.

681
01:19:18,379 --> 01:19:21,840
<font color=#ffff80>It is time! It is time!</font>

682
01:19:22,299 --> 01:19:23,550
Esther!

683
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:25,594
Sarah!

684
01:19:26,303 --> 01:19:27,805
You'll be coming soon!

685
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:31,183
<font color=#ffff80>It is time! It is time!</font>

686
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:36,230
You are a priest of this place?

687
01:19:39,275 --> 01:19:40,484
Isn't it written

688
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:46,323
that "my house shall be a house
of prayer for all nations"?

689
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:48,117
As you see.

690
01:19:49,743 --> 01:19:51,662
This is a marketplace.

691
01:19:53,998 --> 01:19:57,376
A place to buy god's forgiveness
with a dove or a lamb.

692
01:19:57,626 --> 01:20:01,588
The people need to make their
sacrifices, as they've always done,

693
01:20:02,172 --> 01:20:03,966
as god demands of us.

694
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:09,847
And does god demand that this

695
01:20:10,347 --> 01:20:13,100
is how the people should show
their true repentance?

696
01:20:13,892 --> 01:20:16,061
A flick of your knife
on the altar?

697
01:20:16,979 --> 01:20:18,981
A psalm to recite
on their way out?

698
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:24,903
Have their hearts been altered
when they leave this place?

699
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:30,242
Are they willing to change their
lives, to give up everything,

700
01:20:30,326 --> 01:20:31,744
and follow god?

701
01:20:39,335 --> 01:20:40,669
He's mad. He's crazy!

702
01:20:40,753 --> 01:20:44,256
God's kingdom is not to be
bought and sold!

703
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:56,143
<font color=#ffff80>It is time! It is time!</font>

704
01:20:56,185 --> 01:20:59,060
- He's destroying the temple!
- Grab him!

705
01:21:03,817 --> 01:21:04,818
Rabbi!

706
01:21:05,944 --> 01:21:07,696
- He's mad!
- Don't do it!

707
01:21:15,496 --> 01:21:16,997
Not one stone.

708
01:21:17,081 --> 01:21:22,086
Not one stone of this place will be
left which will not be torn down!

709
01:21:24,421 --> 01:21:26,256
You can't hurt him now!

710
01:21:29,468 --> 01:21:31,595
Nothing you can do
can touch him!

711
01:21:33,764 --> 01:21:34,807
Move!

712
01:21:45,943 --> 01:21:47,152
Get him out!

713
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:49,530
Get back.
Get him out! Get him out.

714
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:55,369
God will judge you!
He will judge you all!

715
01:21:59,206 --> 01:22:00,874
- Get him out!
- Stand back!

716
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:06,338
Hurry! Hurry!

717
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:08,173
What's he doing?

718
01:22:08,257 --> 01:22:09,383
Rabbi!

719
01:22:10,926 --> 01:22:12,886
You will bring ruin to us all!

720
01:22:12,970 --> 01:22:13,971
Do it!

721
01:22:14,471 --> 01:22:16,473
Rabbi! Begin it!

722
01:22:20,894 --> 01:22:22,312
Begin it now!

723
01:22:25,524 --> 01:22:28,569
Rabbi! You must begin it!

724
01:22:57,806 --> 01:23:01,143
It was the perfect time.
It was the perfect time.

725
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:04,146
Why didn't he begin it?

726
01:23:05,522 --> 01:23:07,274
Why didn't he begin it?

727
01:23:28,045 --> 01:23:30,547
Brother, come.
You are safe.

728
01:23:30,631 --> 01:23:32,591
Come. Welcome.

729
01:23:33,133 --> 01:23:34,134
Welcome, my brother.

730
01:23:48,649 --> 01:23:51,151
We will keep
passover here tonight.

731
01:23:51,443 --> 01:23:52,861
What about tomorrow, brother?

732
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:57,324
Tomorrow, we try again.

733
01:23:57,908 --> 01:23:59,451
- Did he say...
- No.

734
01:24:01,161 --> 01:24:04,164
For now, we leave him to rest.

735
01:24:05,582 --> 01:24:07,793
Later, he wishes us
to go to the hills with him

736
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:09,127
to be with god.

737
01:24:09,962 --> 01:24:12,506
Peter, we should act
while the feeling is high.

738
01:24:12,589 --> 01:24:14,716
But they will be hunting us now.

739
01:24:15,008 --> 01:24:18,136
He needs to act soon.
He's stalling.

740
01:24:18,845 --> 01:24:22,975
I think there will be
another miracle, some kind of sign.

741
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:25,018
So many rose up in support.

742
01:24:25,102 --> 01:24:26,979
The kingdom will come.

743
01:24:56,717 --> 01:25:00,178
I have seen you heal the sick,

744
01:25:01,179 --> 01:25:02,723
raise the dead.

745
01:25:07,769 --> 01:25:12,065
One word from you, and I know god
would turn this world upside down.

746
01:25:14,318 --> 01:25:16,486
Just as the prophets
told us he would.

747
01:25:19,573 --> 01:25:20,699
The poor,

748
01:25:22,826 --> 01:25:24,161
the suffering,

749
01:25:27,247 --> 01:25:28,457
the dead,

750
01:25:32,919 --> 01:25:34,421
the beloved dead

751
01:25:37,591 --> 01:25:38,884
will rise,

752
01:25:40,218 --> 01:25:41,637
and you will be crowned king.

753
01:25:48,393 --> 01:25:49,728
Say the word.

754
01:25:52,064 --> 01:25:54,066
We have given you everything.

755
01:25:55,942 --> 01:25:57,110
Our lives.

756
01:25:58,695 --> 01:25:59,738
Our hope.

757
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:02,032
Perhaps we have misunderstood.

758
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:05,202
Perhaps the kingdom is not...

759
01:26:05,285 --> 01:26:06,411
No!

760
01:26:07,496 --> 01:26:10,123
Our faith is what
makes the miracles.

761
01:26:10,999 --> 01:26:12,334
Our belief.

762
01:26:14,836 --> 01:26:15,962
Tell her.

763
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:19,549
Tell her she's wrong.

764
01:26:25,013 --> 01:26:26,682
Tell her she's wrong.

765
01:26:33,647 --> 01:26:34,940
Judas.

766
01:27:21,361 --> 01:27:23,530
When the baptist anointed me,

767
01:27:26,825 --> 01:27:28,493
there was no holy oil,

768
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:32,080
no ceremony.

769
01:27:40,422 --> 01:27:42,549
And it was like this.

770
01:27:58,023 --> 01:28:00,400
Open your eyes to the light.

771
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:08,784
It has begun.

772
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:18,293
Don't stop it now.

773
01:28:19,628 --> 01:28:21,671
Don't let them stop it.

774
01:28:27,177 --> 01:28:28,762
I'll be with you.

775
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:32,224
I won't leave.

776
01:28:33,099 --> 01:28:34,351
Mary.

777
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:40,565
You are my witness.

778
01:28:58,375 --> 01:29:00,252
Everything is prepared.

779
01:30:03,356 --> 01:30:05,233
Give thanks to the lord,

780
01:30:06,860 --> 01:30:09,404
for herein lies good.

781
01:30:11,781 --> 01:30:13,992
A love that endures forever.

782
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:27,881
<font color=#ffff80>Let Israel declare...</font>

783
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:30,050
<font color=#ffff80>His steadfast love is eternal.</font>

784
01:30:31,843 --> 01:30:33,553
<font color=#ffff80>Let the house of Aaron declare...</font>

785
01:30:33,637 --> 01:30:36,806
<font color=#ffff80>His steadfast love is eternal.</font>

786
01:30:37,557 --> 01:30:39,559
<font color=#ffff80>Let those who fear
the Lord declare...</font>

787
01:30:39,643 --> 01:30:42,020
<font color=#ffff80>His steadfast love is eternal.</font>

788
01:32:16,281 --> 01:32:17,991
What is it, rabbi?

789
01:32:23,496 --> 01:32:26,708
I'm only sad because
I must leave you all.

790
01:32:30,837 --> 01:32:32,380
Where are you going?

791
01:32:37,385 --> 01:32:38,636
To god.

792
01:32:50,273 --> 01:32:51,608
He's foreseen something.

793
01:32:51,941 --> 01:32:54,152
We need to take him
away from here.

794
01:32:55,445 --> 01:32:56,821
Back to Cana, maybe.

795
01:32:57,989 --> 01:33:00,283
By force, if need be.

796
01:33:00,366 --> 01:33:01,785
Matthew is right.

797
01:33:03,161 --> 01:33:04,454
He's foreseen something.

798
01:33:04,621 --> 01:33:07,499
Whatever happens now
is what god has asked of him.

799
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:10,251
We have to honor his decision.

800
01:33:10,543 --> 01:33:11,711
Even if he dies?

801
01:33:11,795 --> 01:33:14,089
Has any of this happened
as you expected it to?

802
01:33:15,632 --> 01:33:19,010
If we don't understand, it's because
it's beyond our understanding.

803
01:33:19,469 --> 01:33:21,346
So let him what?

804
01:33:21,971 --> 01:33:24,265
Abandon us? Die?

805
01:33:24,349 --> 01:33:25,892
We have to trust him, Philip.

806
01:33:28,103 --> 01:33:29,562
He's gone to pray.

807
01:33:31,106 --> 01:33:32,607
We should do the same.

808
01:33:34,692 --> 01:33:36,027
This is wrong.

809
01:33:39,114 --> 01:33:40,907
This is wrong.

810
01:35:10,246 --> 01:35:11,497
- Apostles rabbi!
- Run!

811
01:35:11,581 --> 01:35:14,667
- Rabbi, run!
- Rabbi, run!

812
01:35:14,751 --> 01:35:15,752
Run!

813
01:35:15,835 --> 01:35:17,003
Jesus of Nazareth!

814
01:35:17,128 --> 01:35:18,963
- Run!
- No!

815
01:35:32,977 --> 01:35:34,729
He was delaying.

816
01:35:35,271 --> 01:35:36,481
He was afraid.

817
01:35:37,982 --> 01:35:40,443
Now he has to act
to save himself.

818
01:35:43,071 --> 01:35:44,739
No more waiting, Mary.

819
01:35:45,782 --> 01:35:47,450
He will begin it today.

820
01:35:49,786 --> 01:35:51,454
The righteous will rise again.

821
01:35:53,373 --> 01:35:54,832
What did you do?

822
01:35:56,292 --> 01:35:57,961
They will have sentenced him.

823
01:36:22,068 --> 01:36:23,903
Save him!

824
01:36:36,666 --> 01:36:37,709
Rabbi!

825
01:36:38,167 --> 01:36:39,210
Rabbi!

826
01:36:39,377 --> 01:36:41,045
Please!
He is the savior!

827
01:36:42,505 --> 01:36:43,548
Get back!

828
01:36:52,181 --> 01:36:54,058
Lord! Savior!

829
01:42:39,236 --> 01:42:40,613
Where will you go?

830
01:42:43,908 --> 01:42:45,368
To my family.

831
01:44:50,326 --> 01:44:51,327
Mary.

832
01:45:27,655 --> 01:45:29,448
- Mary.
- Matthew.

833
01:45:43,420 --> 01:45:44,505
You were with him?

834
01:45:46,590 --> 01:45:47,800
To the end.

835
01:45:49,969 --> 01:45:53,383
Peter, as the sun rose,
I saw him.

836
01:45:56,058 --> 01:45:57,893
He was there, and he was...

837
01:45:59,895 --> 01:46:01,730
All his pain was gone from him.

838
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:04,441
A dream.

839
01:46:04,525 --> 01:46:07,027
It wasn't a dream.
He was there.

840
01:46:08,279 --> 01:46:10,364
Mary, he is gone from us.

841
01:46:12,324 --> 01:46:13,617
He is dead.

842
01:46:14,660 --> 01:46:16,161
He's not gone.

843
01:46:17,413 --> 01:46:19,456
Even death cannot hold him.

844
01:46:20,374 --> 01:46:22,918
This whole time, we've been looking
for a change in the world,

845
01:46:23,002 --> 01:46:24,420
but it's not what we thought.

846
01:46:25,546 --> 01:46:27,423
The kingdom is here, now.

847
01:46:27,506 --> 01:46:29,884
We failed.
There is no kingdom.

848
01:46:29,967 --> 01:46:31,886
What, the people would rise,

849
01:46:32,845 --> 01:46:35,639
that he would be crowned king,
did he ever say this to you?

850
01:46:36,140 --> 01:46:37,141
Mary.

851
01:46:38,392 --> 01:46:40,853
You saw him? Truly?

852
01:46:41,770 --> 01:46:45,316
But then, the kingdom,
how can that be right?

853
01:46:45,399 --> 01:46:48,569
Because it's not something
we can see with our eyes.

854
01:46:50,487 --> 01:46:52,239
It's here within us.

855
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:55,326
All we have to do is let go of
our anguish and our resentment,

856
01:46:55,409 --> 01:46:57,745
and we become like children,
just as he said.

857
01:46:57,828 --> 01:46:58,954
What do you mean?

858
01:47:00,197 --> 01:47:03,034
The kingdom, it can't be
built through conflict.

859
01:47:03,334 --> 01:47:05,961
Not by opposition,
not by destruction.

860
01:47:06,545 --> 01:47:10,049
It grows with us, with every
act of love and care,

861
01:47:10,132 --> 01:47:11,216
with our forgiveness.

862
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:13,636
We have the power
to lift the people,

863
01:47:13,761 --> 01:47:16,680
just as he did, and then we
will be free, just as he is.

864
01:47:17,181 --> 01:47:18,515
This is what he meant?

865
01:47:19,808 --> 01:47:21,769
And we've been walking
this path to revolution,

866
01:47:21,852 --> 01:47:24,480
as if the kingdom would be
born in flames and blood.

867
01:47:24,813 --> 01:47:25,814
Mary.

868
01:47:28,067 --> 01:47:29,568
Why would he come to you alone?

869
01:47:30,027 --> 01:47:31,403
Why does that matter?

870
01:47:31,744 --> 01:47:34,955
Because you say the
kingdom is here. Now.

871
01:47:37,409 --> 01:47:39,912
And just outside that door,
there is no new world.

872
01:47:41,705 --> 01:47:43,458
No end of oppression.

873
01:47:45,334 --> 01:47:48,796
No justice for the poor,
for the suffering.

874
01:47:50,172 --> 01:47:53,467
How does it feel to carry that
anger around in your heart?

875
01:47:54,885 --> 01:47:57,304
Does it lessen
as the days go by?

876
01:47:59,848 --> 01:48:02,434
We have the power
to relieve their suffering.

877
01:48:02,518 --> 01:48:03,936
It is up to us.

878
01:48:09,024 --> 01:48:10,651
I believe you, Mary.

879
01:48:14,363 --> 01:48:16,281
I believe that you saw him,

880
01:48:19,159 --> 01:48:20,452
that he came to you,

881
01:48:23,872 --> 01:48:25,207
and it was a sign

882
01:48:27,626 --> 01:48:29,503
that he will return,

883
01:48:30,671 --> 01:48:32,464
and he will bring the kingdom,

884
01:48:34,633 --> 01:48:35,884
the true kingdom.

885
01:48:39,847 --> 01:48:40,931
The new world.

886
01:48:42,975 --> 01:48:46,145
The world will only change
as we change.

887
01:48:50,232 --> 01:48:55,404
It's not right that you come here now
to tell us he has chosen you before us,

888
01:48:55,487 --> 01:48:59,908
that he has brought you
some special message.

889
01:49:00,034 --> 01:49:02,327
He gathered us
for what was inside.

890
01:49:02,411 --> 01:49:04,788
We were all precious to him.
We were all his apostles.

891
01:49:04,872 --> 01:49:06,749
Every man in this room

892
01:49:08,709 --> 01:49:10,127
is his rock,

893
01:49:10,669 --> 01:49:11,962
his church

894
01:49:14,214 --> 01:49:16,467
upon which he will build

895
01:49:17,259 --> 01:49:19,553
his glorious new world

896
01:49:21,597 --> 01:49:23,182
with one purpose

897
01:49:25,517 --> 01:49:27,019
and one message.

898
01:49:27,394 --> 01:49:28,937
Your message.

899
01:49:30,064 --> 01:49:31,356
Not his.

900
01:49:34,943 --> 01:49:37,196
You have weakened us, Mary.

901
01:49:40,824 --> 01:49:42,159
You weakened him.

902
01:49:57,883 --> 01:50:01,053
All I can do is hope that
you've heard what I have said.

903
01:50:03,972 --> 01:50:06,266
Pray that you see me as I am.

904
01:50:08,685 --> 01:50:11,188
I value each one of you
as he did.

905
01:50:14,483 --> 01:50:17,069
You are all my brothers,
and I thank you.

906
01:50:21,448 --> 01:50:25,244
But I will not stay
and be silent.

907
01:50:27,329 --> 01:50:28,747
I will be heard.

908
01:51:11,582 --> 01:51:13,417
You do not lose heart.

909
01:51:14,751 --> 01:51:15,919
Even now.

910
01:51:22,676 --> 01:51:25,387
Didn't you ask,
"what will it be like?"

911
01:51:27,931 --> 01:51:29,224
"The kingdom?"

912
01:51:50,662 --> 01:51:52,289
<i>It is like a seed.</i>

913
01:51:55,834 --> 01:51:58,503
<i>A single grain of mustard seed,</i>

914
01:51:59,922 --> 01:52:02,841
<i>which a woman took
and sowed in her garden.</i>

915
01:52:04,801 --> 01:52:06,261
<i>And it grew,</i>

916
01:52:07,971 --> 01:52:09,348
<i>and it grew.</i>

917
01:52:11,266 --> 01:52:15,354
<i>And the birds of the air
made nests in its branches.</i>
