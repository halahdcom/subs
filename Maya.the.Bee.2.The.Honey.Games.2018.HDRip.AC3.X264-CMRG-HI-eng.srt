Wow, Maya, that was amazing!

Thanks, Ronnie, I'd love to,
but our hive never gets invited.

Yep, and I think
that's a good thing.

Aw Willi,
we were just having fun!

You were having fun, Maya.
I was having...

[stammers]
What's the opposite of fun?

Is everything in order, Crawley?

00:04:55,686 --> 00:04:58,018
Certainly, ma'am. The honey
barrels are being stacked

Hello, Mr. Important
Looking Big Bee, Sir.

Sorry we bumped into you.
I'm Maya and this is Willi.

Hmm, indeed.

00:06:11,927 --> 00:06:13,961
- I am looking for Poppy Meadow.
- [Maya] Hmm. Huh?

95
00:06:13,963 --> 00:06:17,732
I have a very important message
to deliver to the Queen.

96
00:06:17,734 --> 00:06:20,905
[gasps]
You're from Buzztropolis!

97
00:06:21,104 --> 00:06:22,569
Very observant.

98
00:06:22,571 --> 00:06:24,274
[Maya gasps]
An important message?

99
00:06:24,508 --> 00:06:28,009
That could only mean one thing.
Did you hear that, Willi?

100
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:29,143
- Did you hear it?
- Ahh...

101
00:06:29,145 --> 00:06:32,316
- We're going to the Honey Games!
- We are?

102
00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:35,753
- [Willi groans]
- This is really happening!

103
00:06:36,753 --> 00:06:37,688
Yes!

104
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:42,693
Follow me, Mr. What'sa-Face.
I'll take you to the Queen!

Well done, Poppy Meadow.

122
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:32,506
I am Sir Beegood the third.

123
00:07:32,508 --> 00:07:35,509
I come from Buzztropolis
with good news,

124
00:07:35,511 --> 00:07:37,978
direct from the Empress herself.

125
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,881
- [gasps]
- As you know,

126
00:07:39,883 --> 00:07:42,917
the glorious Honey Games
are about to commence,

127
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:47,725
and your hive has been selected
for a great, great honor...

128
00:07:48,023 --> 00:07:49,357
Told you, Willi!

129
00:07:49,359 --> 00:07:51,725
They're inviting us
to the Honey Games!

130
00:07:51,727 --> 00:07:54,198
[Beegood]
...to generously contribute

131
00:07:54,397 --> 00:07:58,133
half your honey harvest
to the Honey Games!

132
00:07:58,135 --> 00:07:59,734
- [all gasp]
- Oh no!

133
00:07:59,736 --> 00:08:02,907
Yay! [woops]

134
00:08:03,573 --> 00:08:04,872
Wait. What?

135
00:08:04,874 --> 00:08:08,809
What? Half our honey?
That's nearly 50 percent!

136
00:08:08,811 --> 00:08:11,646
You can't do that!
It's not fair!

137
00:08:11,648 --> 00:08:13,148
Maya, no.

138
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,648
[sighs]

139
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:17,218
It is an honor indeed,
Sir Beegood,

140
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,724
however, your request
is unreasonable.

141
00:08:19,922 --> 00:08:23,960
We can certainly contribute
a little honey, but half?

142
00:08:24,227 --> 00:08:26,360
Our hive won't make it
through the winter.

143
00:08:26,362 --> 00:08:30,800
You dare refuse
the Empress' order?

144
00:08:31,734 --> 00:08:32,736
[sighs]

145
00:08:35,138 --> 00:08:36,907
Hmm.

146
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:38,876
[squirms]

147
00:08:40,042 --> 00:08:41,946
As the Empress wishes.

148
00:08:42,178 --> 00:08:44,179
[all gasping]

149
00:08:44,181 --> 00:08:46,350
Quite right.

150
00:08:47,017 --> 00:08:48,585
[hums]

151
00:08:48,884 --> 00:08:50,684
No, wait, Mr. Bigbuzz!

152
00:08:50,686 --> 00:08:53,921
I mean, Sir Bees... [groans]
Whatever your name is!

153
00:08:53,923 --> 00:08:56,693
You've made a big mistake!

154
00:08:57,226 --> 00:09:00,395
Oh, Willi,
we have to do something.

155
00:09:00,397 --> 00:09:03,231
Well, yeah,
someone needs to do something.

156
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:06,637
Aw, it's gonna
be a long, hungry winter.

157
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:11,271
[sighs]

158
00:09:11,273 --> 00:09:12,842
[Maya] Your Majesty?

159
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,376
We can't let the Empress
take our honey!

160
00:09:15,378 --> 00:09:19,179
[scoffs] The Empress will do
whatever she wants.

161
00:09:19,181 --> 00:09:20,582
It's not fair!

162
00:09:20,584 --> 00:09:24,986
My big sister doesn't play fair,
she never has.

163
00:09:24,988 --> 00:09:27,558
[gasps] She's your sister?

164
00:09:28,057 --> 00:09:29,125
Oh! Well, then it's easy.

165
00:09:29,127 --> 00:09:31,758
If she's your sister, then you
can just go talk to her.

166
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,863
[chuckles]
She won't listen to me.

167
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,729
Maybe I can help.

168
00:09:35,731 --> 00:09:36,997
No, Maya.

169
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:40,434
There are some things
you can't fix on your own.

170
00:09:40,436 --> 00:09:43,573
Excuse me, ma'am.
You're needed in the Great Hall.

171
00:09:44,306 --> 00:09:47,311
Mm. It's not your concern, Maya.

172
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,479

174
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,250
I can't believe
she's the Queen's Sister.

175
00:09:55,252 --> 00:09:57,418
Yeah, and she's a real
meanie bug!

176
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,558
- We have to help the Queen!
- Mm-hm, yep.

177
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:04,626
Willi, what are you doing?
This is an emergency!

178
00:10:04,628 --> 00:10:07,230
Yeah, and this
is my emergency pollen!

179
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:11,299
Anyway, how can we help?
We're just two little bees.

180
00:10:11,301 --> 00:10:14,168
Hmm...
We go to Buzztropolis!

181
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,905
Oh, sure,
we'll just hitch a ride

182
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:17,608
somewhere we've never been

183
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:20,208
and tell a scary Empress
we don't even know,

184
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:21,943
"Sorry, but you can't
take our honey."

185
00:10:21,945 --> 00:10:24,878
Yeah! That's a great plan,
Willi! Come on!

186
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,814
What? Plan? What plan?

187
00:10:26,816 --> 00:10:30,651

[yawns] No more racing today.

193
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:45,900
We don't wanna race,
we need a ride to Buzztropolis!

194
00:10:45,902 --> 00:10:49,170
Huh? That's a long way.
I don't want to go there.

195
00:10:49,172 --> 00:10:51,506
- Come on, Drago. Just this once.
- No, no, no.

Ready, Willi?

Uh-uh, not this little bee, no...

[Queen]
Right, we must prepare.

205
00:11:14,898 --> 00:11:17,600
Bronson, count up all the honey
barrels in the Great Hall.

206
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,968
Rupert go and tally
the reserves.

Your Majesty! Maya and Willi
were seen leaving the meadow!

211
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:31,346
It looked like
they were heading for...

212
00:11:31,348 --> 00:11:32,883
Buzztropolis.

213

They're going
to the Honey Games.

00:11:50,566 --> 00:11:53,070
Yeah, but they are invited.

Whoa, what is that?

220
00:11:55,739 --> 00:11:59,209
That is Buzztropolis.

It's beautiful.

- Thanks, Drago.

224
00:12:17,226 --> 00:12:19,694
Come on, Willi.
Let's find the Empress!

225
00:12:19,696 --> 00:12:21,728
Uh, no, I'll just wait here
with Drago.

- Hey!
- Whoops.

Whoops yourself! Step away
from the hair, meadow bug.

Sorry, I'm looking for my friend
Willi, have you seen him?

Uh... no.

Ah. But we have urgent business
with the Empress.

Hmm.
Want to see the Empress, huh?

Her throne's right around there.

261
00:14:09,471 --> 00:14:12,106
Why don't you just buzz over
and talk to her?

Oh! I will. Thanks.

One moment, Miss Empressy.

324
00:16:58,374 --> 00:17:00,674
Willi, give it to me now!

325
00:17:00,676 --> 00:17:02,546
[both groan]

326
00:17:03,012 --> 00:17:04,348
- [wet thud]
- [Queen grunts]

327
00:17:05,782 --> 00:17:07,384
[groans]

328
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,585
[all gasp]

329
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:12,153
- Let me help you.
- No! Stay away!

330
00:17:12,155 --> 00:17:13,988
[both groan]

331
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,392
Willi, help!

332
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:19,895
[all groaning and grunting]

333
00:17:25,001 --> 00:17:26,770
- [crash]
- [all gasp]

334
00:17:28,003 --> 00:17:30,907
Ha! Typical meadow bug.

335
00:17:32,475 --> 00:17:34,211
- [Queen] Maya?
- Oh.

336
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:37,314
[nervous chuckle]

337
00:17:38,481 --> 00:17:41,718
I've never been so humiliated
in my life, Beatrice!

338
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,550
She must be punished!

339
00:17:43,552 --> 00:17:46,220
I will talk to her, Catherine.

340
00:17:46,222 --> 00:17:50,357
She assaults the Empress
and you'll talk to her?

341
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:53,059
This is why your hive
is a laughing stock.

342
00:17:53,061 --> 00:17:55,730
- We are not!
- Really?

343
00:17:55,732 --> 00:17:58,264
No order. No rules.

344
00:17:58,266 --> 00:18:02,838
Little bees who talk
out of turn. [grunts] Grr!

345
00:18:03,238 --> 00:18:07,207
And you wonder why I don't
invite you to the Honey Games.

346
00:18:07,209 --> 00:18:09,309
[gasps]
Maybe you're scared we'll win.

347
00:18:09,311 --> 00:18:11,378
[cackling] Oh, please.

348
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,348
The Honey Games
are for elite bugs.

349
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,850
You never had what it takes,
and by the looks

350
00:18:16,852 --> 00:18:19,386
of this bumble bug,
neither does she.

351
00:18:19,388 --> 00:18:22,258
Maya is one of my best bees.

352
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:26,559
Ha! She's no match
for the best of Buzztropolis.

353
00:18:26,561 --> 00:18:29,530
- I am too! And so is Willi!
- Maya!

354
00:18:29,532 --> 00:18:30,897
- [all gasp]
- [Maya] It's true.

355
00:18:30,899 --> 00:18:33,567
Poppy Meadow bees
are braver and faster and nicer

356
00:18:33,569 --> 00:18:35,603
than any of you city bees!

357
00:18:35,605 --> 00:18:37,570
- Maya, hush.
- [Empress] No, no, no.

358
00:18:37,572 --> 00:18:40,543
If your little bee
is so confident,

359
00:18:40,877 --> 00:18:45,646
I invite her and her friend
to compete in the Games.

360
00:18:45,648 --> 00:18:46,550
[gasps]

361
00:18:49,418 --> 00:18:50,550
[sighs]

362
00:18:50,552 --> 00:18:53,590
If they win, all is forgiven.

363
00:18:53,923 --> 00:18:55,225
But if they lose,

364
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,924
I'll make an example
of this pair

365
00:18:57,926 --> 00:19:00,763
and take all your summer honey.

366
00:19:01,196 --> 00:19:03,632
Every last drop.

367
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:06,403
But our hive
won't last the winter!

368
00:19:07,637 --> 00:19:11,108
Poppy Meadow doesn't even
have a team! We're not prepared.

369
00:19:11,873 --> 00:19:15,276
[claps hands]
Beegood, assemble a squad

370
00:19:15,278 --> 00:19:19,049
of Poppy Meadow's
most gifted bugs immediately.

371
00:19:19,314 --> 00:19:23,419
[sighs] Yes, your regal-ness.
Of course.

372
00:19:23,985 --> 00:19:26,989
Let the games begin.

373
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:37,334
I am very disappointed
in you, Maya.

374
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:41,100
I specifically asked you
not to get involved.

375
00:19:41,102 --> 00:19:43,806
I know. I just wanted to help.

376
00:19:44,407 --> 00:19:46,376
But I didn't, did I?

377
00:19:47,042 --> 00:19:50,880
You have to stop buzzing in,
thinking you know what's best.

378
00:19:51,214 --> 00:19:53,383
I'm so sorry, Miss Queen.

379
00:19:53,648 --> 00:19:54,917
[sighs]

380
00:19:55,318 --> 00:19:57,320
Well, we're here now.

381
00:19:57,887 --> 00:20:00,157
And you can't win these Games
on your own.

382
00:20:00,388 --> 00:20:02,892
You must listen to your team.

383
00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:05,695
I will. I promise.

384
00:20:06,896 --> 00:20:08,231
[guard clears throat]

385
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:10,233
Time to go, ma'am.

386
00:20:11,234 --> 00:20:13,235
I believe in you, Maya.

387
00:20:13,735 --> 00:20:16,505
I know you can
make Poppy Meadow proud.

388
00:20:16,906 --> 00:20:18,308
Mm-hm.

389
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,007
[sighs]

390
00:20:20,009 --> 00:20:21,541
- [Queen] Willi?
- Huh?

391
00:20:21,543 --> 00:20:24,180
Maya, make sure
you stick together.

392
00:20:24,847 --> 00:20:27,216
- And good luck.
- [Willi giggles nervously]

393
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:29,585
[sighs]

394
00:20:31,419 --> 00:20:36,359
[sighs] Willi, the whole hive
is depending on us.

395
00:20:36,792 --> 00:20:38,595
Hmm, yeah.

396
00:20:39,395 --> 00:20:42,065
But hey, this won't be so hard.

397
00:20:42,398 --> 00:20:45,398
I mean, you are the fastest
racer in Poppy Meadow.

398
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,239
[giggles] Whoa.
The Honey Games Village.

399
00:20:52,808 --> 00:20:56,210
[announcer] All bugs report
to the gathering place.

400
00:20:56,212 --> 00:20:59,980
Orientation will commence
in five minutes.

401
00:20:59,982 --> 00:21:01,915
- Come on!
- Oh, hey, wait for me.

402
00:21:01,917 --> 00:21:03,719
[Maya chuckles]

403
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,886
You're right Willi,
we can do this.

404
00:21:06,888 --> 00:21:09,356
We just need
to put our best foot forward.

405
00:21:09,358 --> 00:21:12,091
Uh, but which one
is my best foot?

406
00:21:12,093 --> 00:21:13,594
[grunts]

407
00:21:13,596 --> 00:21:14,763
[chuckles]

408
00:21:19,334 --> 00:21:21,301
Hey, wait for me! Whoa!

409
00:21:21,303 --> 00:21:23,771
Willi, look at all
the different bugs!

410
00:21:23,773 --> 00:21:25,271
[bugs cheer]

411
00:21:25,273 --> 00:21:28,344
- Look! Willi?
- [Willi screams]

412
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,880
[groans]

413
00:21:31,446 --> 00:21:32,515
[gasps]

414
00:21:32,848 --> 00:21:34,149
[choir singing]

415
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,382
[shimmering]

416
00:21:35,384 --> 00:21:36,853
Can I help you?

417
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,722
[sighs]

418
00:21:39,888 --> 00:21:43,526
Hello? Do you speak, goggle-bug?

419
00:21:44,092 --> 00:21:46,225
Ahh. Hi.

420
00:21:46,227 --> 00:21:48,931
I'm Willi,
and this is my best foot.

421
00:21:49,631 --> 00:21:52,265
- Or is it this one?
- [chuckling]

422
00:21:52,267 --> 00:21:54,134
[gong chimes]

423
00:21:54,136 --> 00:21:56,239
Ugh! Let's buzz.

424
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:00,709
- [chuckles] Mm.
- Willi! There you are!

425
00:22:01,676 --> 00:22:02,678
Willi?

426
00:22:03,713 --> 00:22:05,514
[gasps]
That looks like our flag!

427
00:22:07,215 --> 00:22:09,482
Um, where's our team?

428
00:22:09,484 --> 00:22:12,552
[chuckles] The weird new bugs?

429
00:22:12,554 --> 00:22:14,821
They're hiding
down at Skeeter Swamp.

430
00:22:14,823 --> 00:22:16,456
Good luck with that bunch.

431
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:19,528
[bugles playing a salute]

432
00:22:21,062 --> 00:22:22,562
Good evening, bugs.

433
00:22:22,564 --> 00:22:25,398
Welcome
to the Honey Games Village.

434
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,269
I am Games Master Beegood.

435
00:22:29,271 --> 00:22:32,138
[royal music]

436
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,973
- [Maya] Flip!
- [gasps]

437
00:22:33,975 --> 00:22:36,312
[Maya] Hey Flip, over here!

438
00:22:38,481 --> 00:22:41,548
Maya! Fancy seein' you
‘ere little buzzer!

439
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:44,885
[Beegood clears his throat]

440
00:22:44,887 --> 00:22:46,386
Thank you.

441
00:22:46,388 --> 00:22:48,521
Over the next three days,

442
00:22:48,523 --> 00:22:51,290
teams representing
the five meadows

443
00:22:51,292 --> 00:22:53,926
will compete against each other.

444
00:22:53,928 --> 00:22:59,098
At the end of each day,
one team will be eliminated.

445
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,838
This year's teams are...

446
00:23:02,405 --> 00:23:05,438
- Team Buggy Hollow!
- [cheering]

447
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,274
Team Burly Bluff!

448
00:23:08,276 --> 00:23:10,879
Team Aphid Gorge!

449
00:23:12,013 --> 00:23:13,550
Team Tropolis!

450
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:18,385
And finally,
the surprising addition

451
00:23:18,387 --> 00:23:22,222
to this year's lineup,
Team Poppy Meadow.

452
00:23:22,224 --> 00:23:24,226
[gasps] That's us Willi!

453
00:23:24,459 --> 00:23:28,395
On the final day,
the two remaining teams

454
00:23:28,397 --> 00:23:31,266
will compete
in front of the Empress...

455
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,638
...for The Honey Cup!

456
00:23:35,103 --> 00:23:37,806
[gasps and applause]

457
00:23:38,474 --> 00:23:41,878
Willi, we're gonna win that cup.

458
00:23:43,178 --> 00:23:44,380
[Violet chuckles]

459
00:23:45,046 --> 00:23:47,216
We're gonna win that cup.

460
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:49,319
Bye Willi.

461
00:23:51,887 --> 00:23:53,389
Bye.

462
00:23:55,623 --> 00:23:58,560
[sighs] So, where's our cabin?

463
00:24:02,932 --> 00:24:04,567
Over here.

464
00:24:10,138 --> 00:24:11,838
Uh, I don't know.

465
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,273
- It doesn't look very safe.
- [Flip] Hello little ones.

466
00:24:14,275 --> 00:24:15,644
[Maya] Flip!

467
00:24:16,278 --> 00:24:17,543
Are you lost?

468
00:24:17,545 --> 00:24:19,178
We're looking
for Team Poppy's cabin.

469
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:23,983
Oh, you won't find it up there.
That's Slug Hill, a nasty place.

470
00:24:23,985 --> 00:24:27,424
It's out of bounds.
Your cabin's just over there.

471
00:24:28,189 --> 00:24:29,556
Who's on our team, Flip?

472
00:24:29,558 --> 00:24:32,262
They said it would be
the finest bugs in Poppy Meadow.

473
00:24:32,528 --> 00:24:35,128
Well, I hope
we know some of them.

474
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:36,996
There's only one way
to find out.

475
00:24:36,998 --> 00:24:39,299
Thanks, Flip! Come on Willi!

476
00:24:39,301 --> 00:24:41,167
- [Maya giggles]
- Good luck you two!

477
00:24:41,169 --> 00:24:43,907
Poppy Meadow
believes in you, kiddo!

478
00:24:48,977 --> 00:24:52,448
Hello, anybody there?

479
00:24:52,814 --> 00:24:54,583
Hello?

480
00:24:58,219 --> 00:25:00,322
- [both scream]
- [Willi gasps]

481
00:25:00,589 --> 00:25:03,257
Uh, guys. You can come out.

482
00:25:03,259 --> 00:25:06,029
It's, like, not Violet.

483
00:25:06,262 --> 00:25:08,194
Maya, quick, hide!

484
00:25:08,196 --> 00:25:10,396
Uh, maybe I'm in
the wrong place.

485
00:25:10,398 --> 00:25:12,098
I bet it's one of her friends.

486
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:15,434
Beat it, city bee! This cave's
for Poppy Meadow bugs only!

487
00:25:15,436 --> 00:25:17,607
I am a Poppy Meadow bug!

488
00:25:18,541 --> 00:25:19,839
[sniffs]

489
00:25:19,841 --> 00:25:22,209
She doesn't smell
like one of Violet's friends.

490
00:25:22,211 --> 00:25:24,711
- Violet's not my friend.
- Lucky you.

491
00:25:24,713 --> 00:25:26,480
That girl's meaner
than a scorpion

492
00:25:26,482 --> 00:25:28,048
that stung its own backside.

493
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:29,549
And she's mean too.

494
00:25:29,551 --> 00:25:34,256
And she thinks she's, like,
so funny, but she's so not.

495
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:37,627
She won't be laughing
when we win that golden cup.

496
00:25:38,194 --> 00:25:41,231
Guys wait, she's serious.

497
00:25:42,263 --> 00:25:44,399
No one thinks we can win.

498
00:25:44,899 --> 00:25:48,301
But aren't you the finest bugs
in Poppy Meadow?

499
00:25:48,303 --> 00:25:51,003
[all laugh]

500
00:25:51,005 --> 00:25:52,472
That's so funny.

501
00:25:52,474 --> 00:25:55,041
We're only here
because Beegood said

502
00:25:55,043 --> 00:25:57,045
we'd won a trip
to the Honey Games.

503
00:25:57,378 --> 00:25:59,549
He never told us
we had to compete.

504
00:26:00,582 --> 00:26:04,885
Don't stress, the sooner we lose
the sooner we can go home.

505
00:26:04,887 --> 00:26:07,557
What? No! I have to win.

506
00:26:07,822 --> 00:26:09,691
We have to win!

507
00:26:11,726 --> 00:26:14,030
Anyway,
what's your name little bee?

508
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:17,297
I'm Maya,
and that's my friend Willi.

509
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:20,133
- Hi. Maya, run now!
- What's your name?

510
00:26:20,135 --> 00:26:22,605
I'm Craig,
pleased to meet... [gasps]

511
00:26:23,238 --> 00:26:26,441
Don't worry about Craig,
he hates germs.

512
00:26:27,042 --> 00:26:29,776
I'm sorry little bee,
I just don't shake hands,

513
00:26:29,778 --> 00:26:31,047
unless they're mine.

514
00:26:31,446 --> 00:26:34,414
The spider up there is Spinder.
She's a vegetarian.

515
00:26:34,416 --> 00:26:37,720
If it's got a face,
I don't eat it.

516
00:26:40,321 --> 00:26:42,255
[Willi whimpers]

517
00:26:42,257 --> 00:26:45,759
And the angry little bedbug
over there is Bedford.

518
00:26:45,761 --> 00:26:47,129
[chewing]

519
00:26:47,463 --> 00:26:50,332
Just one thing with him,
sometimes he bites.

520
00:26:52,067 --> 00:26:54,436
[gasps] Strangers!
Save yourselves.

521
00:26:55,169 --> 00:26:58,073
[both]
Hut hut hut hut hut hut hut!

522
00:26:58,407 --> 00:27:01,308
Privates Arnie and Barney
reporting for Games duty, sir!

523
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:03,042
What're you two doing here?

524
00:27:03,044 --> 00:27:06,346
Well, Maya, a little bird told
us you might need some help.

525
00:27:06,348 --> 00:27:08,214
And then it tried to eat us.

526
00:27:08,216 --> 00:27:10,216
It was actually
quite a big bird.

527
00:27:10,218 --> 00:27:12,819
So, here we are,
peak physical specimens.

528
00:27:12,821 --> 00:27:13,854
- Higher!
- Faster.

529
00:27:13,856 --> 00:27:14,687
- Stronger!
- Weaker.

530
00:27:14,689 --> 00:27:15,923
[Arnie]
Beatle, sunshine, raindrop.

531
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:17,590
[Barney] Now you're just
listing words, Arnie,

532
00:27:17,592 --> 00:27:19,626
- but who needs words?
- Not me, Barney.

533
00:27:19,628 --> 00:27:21,395
Actions speak louder than words.

534
00:27:21,397 --> 00:27:24,130
- Burpees!
- [both belch]

535
00:27:24,132 --> 00:27:25,232
Chin ups!

536
00:27:25,234 --> 00:27:27,166
Feel the burn. Feel the burn!

537
00:27:27,168 --> 00:27:28,335
It's burning.

538
00:27:28,337 --> 00:27:29,906
And shake it off.

539
00:27:30,738 --> 00:27:32,371
These guys are strange.

540
00:27:32,373 --> 00:27:35,041
Don't worry,
they'll grow on you.

541
00:27:35,043 --> 00:27:36,710
- Huh?
- Grow on us?

542
00:27:36,712 --> 00:27:38,681
Like fungus? [groans]

543
00:27:38,947 --> 00:27:40,850
You can sleep over there.
[chuckles nervously]

544
00:27:42,717 --> 00:27:45,918
Good night!
Hut hut hut hut hut hut!

545
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,222
[snoring]

546
00:27:47,889 --> 00:27:50,025
We can't win with these bugs.

547
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:53,730
We can do this.
Every bug has a talent.

548
00:28:03,938 --> 00:28:04,838
[screams]

549
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,773
I've got my eyes on you,
both of them.

550
00:28:07,775 --> 00:28:09,211
[teeth chatter]

551
00:28:20,723 --> 00:28:22,588
[crowd cheering]

552
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,558
[Mantis] Good morning bugs!

553
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:29,463
And welcome to day one
of competition!

554
00:28:29,465 --> 00:28:33,066
Today's event is Dodge Ball!

555
00:28:33,068 --> 00:28:39,338
The team with the fewest points
at day's end will be eliminated.

556
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,540
[Beegood] First round,

557
00:28:40,542 --> 00:28:45,548
team Burly Bluff
versus team Poppy Meadow.

558
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,350
Teams into position.

559
00:28:47,582 --> 00:28:51,253
Seriously?
Even their muscles have muscles.

560
00:28:52,754 --> 00:28:54,489
This should be good.

561
00:28:56,891 --> 00:28:58,593
[snickers]

562
00:28:59,461 --> 00:29:02,765
We'll be great, just follow
my lead. Everyone ready?

563
00:29:05,067 --> 00:29:06,636
[blows whistle] Play ball!

564
00:29:07,069 --> 00:29:08,501
[thudding and grunting]

565
00:29:08,503 --> 00:29:09,638
Whoa!

566
00:29:10,071 --> 00:29:11,239
Whoa!

567
00:29:11,473 --> 00:29:12,606
Okay time out, time out!

568
00:29:12,608 --> 00:29:14,974
- Huh?
- What did he...? What?

569
00:29:14,976 --> 00:29:17,144
[gasps]
Arnie how did you do that?

570
00:29:17,146 --> 00:29:18,511
As long as you make a capital T,

571
00:29:18,513 --> 00:29:21,915
you put this hand on top
of this hand, the game stops.

572
00:29:21,917 --> 00:29:23,049
Show me again!

573
00:29:23,051 --> 00:29:24,584
Oh sure,
you take this hand and...

574
00:29:24,586 --> 00:29:25,751
[gasps]

575
00:29:25,753 --> 00:29:27,186
Extra time... [gasps]

576
00:29:27,188 --> 00:29:28,590
[both moan]

577
00:29:30,591 --> 00:29:31,727
[Willi groans]

578
00:29:32,927 --> 00:29:35,628
[Beegood]
Team Burly Bluff win!

579
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:39,398
[snickering]
Boom, show me the love.

580
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:43,736
[Beegood] Team Burly Bluff
versus Team Tropolis!

581
00:29:43,738 --> 00:29:45,674
[crowd cheering]

582
00:29:47,609 --> 00:29:48,642
[chuckles]

583
00:29:48,644 --> 00:29:52,648
Well, well, more little bugs.

584
00:29:53,014 --> 00:29:55,882
Oh, poor Violet, I can't watch.

585
00:29:55,884 --> 00:29:56,886
[whistle blows]

586
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:06,960
[voice slowed down]
Oh, no!

587
00:30:06,962 --> 00:30:08,231
[crowd gasping]

588
00:30:08,233 --> 00:30:09,562
[grunts]

589
00:30:09,564 --> 00:30:10,766
Oh no.

590
00:30:15,003 --> 00:30:15,937
[whistle blows]

591
00:30:17,606 --> 00:30:20,607
[Beegood]
Team Tropolis wins!

592
00:30:20,609 --> 00:30:21,778
[snickers]

593
00:30:22,043 --> 00:30:23,345
Next.

594
00:30:23,878 --> 00:30:26,378
Oh, she's really good.

595
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,583
[sighs] She sure is.

596
00:30:29,051 --> 00:30:30,383
We're good too!

597
00:30:30,385 --> 00:30:33,056
If we work together,
we can achieve anything.

598
00:30:33,554 --> 00:30:39,061
[groans] I think motivational
speaking is, like, her thing.

599
00:30:39,727 --> 00:30:44,566
[Beegood] Team Buggy Hollow
versus Team Aphid Gorge!

600
00:30:46,267 --> 00:30:48,068
Aww, how cute.

601
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:52,071
Don't worry, little baby bugs.
We'll go easy on you.

602
00:30:52,073 --> 00:30:53,842
[cooing]

603
00:30:55,843 --> 00:30:57,345
Let's get ‘em all!

604
00:30:57,646 --> 00:30:58,648
[all gasp]

605
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:03,218
[whistle blows]

606
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,388
[groaning]

607
00:31:06,588 --> 00:31:11,193
[Beegood] Team Tropolis
versus Team Poppy Meadow!

608
00:31:12,224 --> 00:31:13,193
[crowd cheering]

609
00:31:13,195 --> 00:31:17,062
[chuckles] Looking a bit
off-color, Team Poppy.

610
00:31:17,064 --> 00:31:18,567
[sighs]

611
00:31:20,168 --> 00:31:21,902
Team Tropolis attack!

612
00:31:21,904 --> 00:31:23,606
Let's go, Team Poppy!

613
00:31:25,006 --> 00:31:27,810
[screaming]

614
00:31:29,878 --> 00:31:31,313
[chuckles then grunts]

615
00:31:35,751 --> 00:31:36,816
Willi!

616
00:31:36,818 --> 00:31:38,253
Pollen.

617
00:31:41,723 --> 00:31:42,892
[whimpers]

618
00:31:43,725 --> 00:31:46,262
Craig, throw the pollen!

619
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:52,165
- [sighs] I'm so out of here.
- [Maya] Spinder!

620
00:31:52,167 --> 00:31:54,934
Bedford, you have to move.

621
00:31:54,936 --> 00:31:55,801
[grunts]

622
00:31:55,803 --> 00:31:59,138
Ha! Great team you got there,
Maya!

623
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,209
[snickering]

624

[both groan]

626
00:32:07,715 --> 00:32:08,850
You saved me.

627
00:32:09,217 --> 00:32:10,986
You're my special friend now.

628
00:32:11,485 --> 00:32:14,154
Arnie! Barney! Help Spinder!

629
00:32:14,156 --> 00:32:15,491
[both] Aye, aye, Captain.

630
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,927
- What did she say?
- She said, "Help spin her."

631
00:32:21,929 --> 00:32:23,696
Ten-four, bug daddy! Spin her!

632
00:32:23,698 --> 00:32:24,900
Spin her, now!

633
00:32:26,801 --> 00:32:27,904
[groaning]

634
00:32:29,404 --> 00:32:31,941

[gasps]

638
00:32:40,282 --> 00:32:43,349
Victory to Team Tropolis!

639
00:32:43,351 --> 00:32:45,085
- [crowd cheering]
- Ha!

640
00:32:45,087 --> 00:32:47,553
Oh, we lost again.

641
00:32:47,555 --> 00:32:49,925
But look, we got some points.

642
00:32:50,544 --> 00:32:51,761
Huh?

643
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:53,393
[Craig] We got points!

644
00:32:53,395 --> 00:32:54,897
We've got points!

645
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:59,569
We got points!
Uh, not that I care.

646
00:33:01,736 --> 00:33:03,235
[whistling]

647
00:33:03,237 --> 00:33:05,070

to make things right

[Mantis]
Ladybugs and gentlebees!

00:59:17,777 --> 00:59:23,815
Welcome

[crowd cheering]

1138
00:59:26,686 --> 00:59:32,224
May I proudly present
Her Majesty,

1139
00:59:32,226 --> 00:59:36,895
the Empress of Buzztropolis!

1140

1142
00:59:42,168 --> 00:59:45,003
must navigate
the Dragonfly Rush,

1143
00:59:45,005 --> 00:59:46,605
and the Mudsucker Muddle

1144
00:59:46,607 --> 00:59:51,212
and then climb the summit
of Mount Stumpy!

1145
00:59:51,878 --> 00:59:53,112
[clap of thunder]

1146
00:59:53,114 --> 00:59:56,882
<i>The competitors must then
retrieve the ruby pollen</i>

1147
00:59:56,884 --> 00:59:59,487
<i>from the Nani Nani Orchid!</i>

1148
00:59:59,685 --> 01:00:04,021
The first team to cross the line
with the ruby pollen,

1149
01:00:04,023 --> 01:00:07,427
will win the Honey Cup!

1150
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:09,596
[all cheering]

1151
01:00:10,063 --> 01:00:16,404
The losing team will receive
these novelty mugs! [chuckles]

[mug clatters]

1153
01:00:17,607 --> 01:00:22,777
And now, introducing
our first grand finalists...

1154
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:25,376
- the favorites...
- Mm-hm.

1155
01:00:25,378 --> 01:00:28,880
...Team Tropolis!

1156
01:00:28,882 --> 01:00:30,685
[crowd cheering]

1157
01:00:32,886 --> 01:00:36,387
Team Poppy are gonna wish
they stayed in their swamp.

1158
01:00:36,389 --> 01:00:41,395
And this year's
surprising wild card...

1159
01:00:41,862 --> 01:00:45,366
Team Poppy!

1160
01:00:45,598 --> 01:00:48,501
[crowd cheering]

1161
01:00:48,935 --> 01:00:50,904
Go, Poppy Meadow!

1162
01:00:52,239 --> 01:00:55,806
- Oh, great! No one turned up.
- Oh, Arnie?

1163
01:00:55,808 --> 01:00:58,108
Yes, sir?
[gasps]

1164
01:00:58,110 --> 01:01:01,882
Oh, they turned up.
Everybody's here.

1165
01:01:03,049 --> 01:01:04,551
Where's Maya?

1166
01:01:04,884 --> 01:01:06,253
[snickers]

1167
01:01:07,888 --> 01:01:09,320
She's been disqualified.

1168
01:01:09,322 --> 01:01:12,859
[gasps] Disqualified?
On what grounds?

1169
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:15,228
Oh, Beatrice, once again,

1170
01:01:15,395 --> 01:01:19,266
you and your hive
have proven to be a disgrace.

1171
01:01:19,465 --> 01:01:21,733
- But...
- [Maya] Miss Empress?

1172
01:01:21,735 --> 01:01:23,067
[crowd gasps]

1173
01:01:23,069 --> 01:01:25,906
Oh. [chuckles]
Little meadow bug.

1174
01:01:26,406 --> 01:01:28,340
You just don't give up, do you?

1175
01:01:28,342 --> 01:01:30,608
Please, hear me out.

1176
01:01:30,610 --> 01:01:32,543
It's not the Queen's fault.

1177
01:01:32,545 --> 01:01:35,750
Oh. [chuckles]
Really?

1178
01:01:36,183 --> 01:01:38,319
Then who's fault is it?

1179
01:01:39,485 --> 01:01:40,585
Mine.

1180
01:01:40,587 --> 01:01:42,487
I'm the one
who came to Buzztropolis

1181
01:01:42,489 --> 01:01:44,257
and made a mess of everything.

1182
01:01:44,590 --> 01:01:46,860
I didn't listen to you,
Your Majesty.

1183
01:01:47,893 --> 01:01:49,196
And in the Games...

1184
01:01:49,795 --> 01:01:53,600
I didn't listen to my team.
They trusted me and...

1185
01:01:54,333 --> 01:01:56,303
and I let them down.

1186
01:01:57,304 --> 01:01:58,773
I'm so sorry.

1187
01:02:00,674 --> 01:02:03,643
And I'm so sorry to you,
Miss Empress,

1188
01:02:03,877 --> 01:02:05,947
for not showing you respect.

1189
01:02:06,947 --> 01:02:10,251
Please don't punish our hive
because of me.

1190
01:02:11,918 --> 01:02:13,050
[bug] Give her a chance!

1191
01:02:13,052 --> 01:02:15,855
[crowd shouting in agreement]

1192
01:02:25,665 --> 01:02:27,301
How touching.

1193
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,236
Such honesty should be rewarded.

1194
01:02:30,737 --> 01:02:34,338
Little bee, I'm going to give
you a second chance

1195
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:36,277
to compete in the final.

1196
01:02:36,710 --> 01:02:38,646
[all cheering]

1197
01:02:40,647 --> 01:02:42,049
But if you lose,

1198
01:02:42,214 --> 01:02:45,349
we will still take
all your summer honey.

1199
01:02:45,351 --> 01:02:47,152
[everyone gasps]

1200
01:02:47,154 --> 01:02:49,520
This summer, next summer,

1201
01:02:49,522 --> 01:02:51,891
and every summer after that.

1202
01:02:52,092 --> 01:02:53,291
- [Queen] Never!
- [Empress gasps]

1203
01:02:53,293 --> 01:02:56,027
I should've stood up to you
a long time ago.

1204
01:02:56,029 --> 01:02:57,431
[everyone gasps]

1205
01:02:58,130 --> 01:03:01,835
We accept your challenge.
And we will win!

1206
01:03:03,136 --> 01:03:04,804
You can do it, Maya.

1207
01:03:05,172 --> 01:03:06,741
[Willi] No.

1208
01:03:07,273 --> 01:03:08,609
We can do it.

1209
01:03:09,342 --> 01:03:10,878
That's what friends do, right?

1210
01:03:11,406 --> 01:03:12,545
[Bedford] Maya?

1211
01:03:13,309 --> 01:03:15,915
You're the first bug
that's ever believed in us.

1212
01:03:19,319 --> 01:03:20,819
Oh, group hug!

1213
01:03:20,821 --> 01:03:23,424
[all chuckling]

1214
01:03:25,725 --> 01:03:27,962
Right, group hug!

1215
01:03:29,728 --> 01:03:30,931
Is she serious?

1216
01:03:31,964 --> 01:03:34,834
Competitors,
to the starting line.

1217
01:03:36,268 --> 01:03:39,237
- What are you, petal?
- I'm a winner, Daddy.

1218
01:03:39,239 --> 01:03:41,306
Right. And what do winners do?

1219
01:03:41,308 --> 01:03:43,775
They win, whatever it takes.

1220
01:03:43,777 --> 01:03:47,311
Exactly.
When you get to Mount Stumpy,

1221
01:03:47,313 --> 01:03:49,547
take the secret tunnel
on the right.

1222
01:03:49,549 --> 01:03:51,648
What? What if we get caught?

1223
01:03:51,650 --> 01:03:53,518
I'm the Games Master,
sweet leaf,

1224
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:54,989
you won't get caught.

1225
01:03:57,223 --> 01:03:59,559
Racers, take your marks!

Get set!

- Let's buzz these bugs!
- Ow!

1229
01:04:23,984 --> 01:04:28,052
Don't grab their feelers.
Steer by leaning your body.

1230
01:04:28,054 --> 01:04:28,989
Come on!

1231
01:04:34,728 --> 01:04:35,896
Let's go!

1232
01:04:36,862 --> 01:04:38,933
I'm flying!

1233
01:04:39,465 --> 01:04:42,502
- Hey, kid, let go!
- [all groaning]

1234
01:04:45,505 --> 01:04:47,838
[gasps] Let go of their feelers!

1235
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:49,543
Go! Move move move!

1236
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:55,212
[Violet]
Let's go!

1237
01:04:55,214 --> 01:04:58,183
Team Poppy
are taking an early lead!

1238
01:04:58,185 --> 01:04:59,353
Yes!

1239
01:05:00,619 --> 01:05:03,556
[Mantis] But Team Tropolis are
not giving up without a fight.

Whoa!

1243
01:05:15,467 --> 01:05:18,471
[Violet] Too slow!
[laughs]

1244
01:05:20,139 --> 01:05:22,877
Should've stayed in bed, bugs!

1245
01:05:25,712 --> 01:05:27,378
[Bedford screams]

1246
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:28,682
Spinder, save him!

1247
01:05:29,715 --> 01:05:30,717
[Maya] You can do it!

1248

[gasps]

1250
01:05:41,261 --> 01:05:43,393
Spinder, you saved me.

1251
01:05:43,395 --> 01:05:45,063
I did it. I did it!

1252
01:05:45,065 --> 01:05:47,635
[woops] Go, Spinder!

1253
01:05:48,735 --> 01:05:49,737
Thank you, Spinder.

1254
01:06:00,714 --> 01:06:03,581
[Mantis] And as they come up
to the Mudsucker Muddle,

1255
01:06:03,583 --> 01:06:07,217
it's Team Tropolis,
a bee's knee in front.

Ugh! So dirty.
I can't, Maya. I can't. [groans]

1261
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:21,668
Let's help him.

[Craig spluttering]

1267
01:06:38,150 --> 01:06:40,853
I'm dirty and muddy and...

I love it! [woops]

I'm not in control!

What are you doing?

1292
01:07:56,295 --> 01:07:58,128
We're winning, Willi.

1293
01:07:58,130 --> 01:08:00,598
- And you're gonna help us.
- Huh?

1294
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:03,136
Tell Maya
you've got a sore wing.

1295
01:08:03,335 --> 01:08:05,305
That'll slow her down.

1296
01:08:05,938 --> 01:08:06,906
What?
