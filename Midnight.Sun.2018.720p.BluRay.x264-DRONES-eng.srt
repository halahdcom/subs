00:00:55,546 --> 00:00:57,346
<i>I have this reoccurring dream.</i>

3
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:01,217
<i>I'm a little
girl sitting with my mom,</i>

4
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:04,253
<i>and she's singing to me.</i>

5
00:01:04,255 --> 00:01:07,223
<i>I feel the warmth
of the sun on my skin</i>

6
00:01:07,225 --> 00:01:08,794
<i>and the comfort of her arms
around me.</i>

7
00:01:10,327 --> 00:01:12,330
<i>And I wanna stay there.</i>

8
00:01:13,398 --> 00:01:15,331
<i>Forever.</i>

9
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:18,936
<i>When I wake up,
I miss the dream.</i>

10
00:01:18,938 --> 00:01:21,738
<i>I want so badly
for this dream to be real,</i>

11
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,407
<i>but that would be impossible</i>

12
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:27,509
<i>because my mom died
when I was really little.</i>

13
00:01:27,511 --> 00:01:29,479
<i>And I can't go out in the sun.</i>

14
00:01:29,481 --> 00:01:31,181
<i>Like, at all.</i>

15
00:01:31,183 --> 00:01:35,617
<i>I have a rare genetic condition
called Xeroderma Pigmentosum,</i>

16
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:39,221
<i>or XP, which basically means</i>

17
00:01:39,223 --> 00:01:41,390
<i>a severe sensitivity
to sunlight.</i>

18
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:43,893
<i>If the sun hits my skin,
I get skin cancer,</i>

19
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:46,464
<i>my brain starts to fail
and I could die.</i>

20
00:01:47,231 --> 00:01:48,965
<i>Pretty fun, right?</i>

21
00:01:48,967 --> 00:01:52,834
<i>So, I spend all my time indoors
behind special windows,</i>

22
00:01:52,836 --> 00:01:56,839
<i>hanging out with my dad
who is the best dad ever.</i>

23
00:01:56,841 --> 00:01:58,975
<i>Thank goodness,
because growing up,</i>

24
00:01:58,977 --> 00:02:01,843
<i>kids were, uh,
what you'd expect.</i>

25
00:02:01,845 --> 00:02:03,948
- No way.
- Yep, a vampire.

26
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,848
That's why they have
special windows.

27
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,951
Don't worry. She can't
get us during the day.

28
00:02:07,953 --> 00:02:11,753
But at night,
stay far, far away.

29
00:02:11,755 --> 00:02:13,715
<i>But not everyone
was afraid of me.</i>

30
00:02:16,327 --> 00:02:18,396
- Hey, Morgan.
- What's wrong with her?

31
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:24,567
She has something called XP.

32
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:28,941
Basically, the light from
the sun, it-it hurts her.

33
00:02:30,408 --> 00:02:32,709
So she can't ever go
in the sun.

34
00:02:32,711 --> 00:02:34,979
I can't be in the sun
for too long either.

35
00:02:34,981 --> 00:02:37,479
Can she play at night?

36
00:02:37,481 --> 00:02:39,284
- Yeah, but...
- See you tonight.

37
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:42,452
Oh, and I like pizza!

38
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,486
<i>From that point on,</i>

39
00:02:44,488 --> 00:02:46,924
<i>it was me, Morgan and my dad.</i>

40
00:02:46,926 --> 00:02:50,927
<i>Until one day, I saw Charlie.</i>

41
00:02:50,929 --> 00:02:53,263
<i>And that was it.</i>

42
00:02:53,265 --> 00:02:55,966
<i>I was completely,
totally, utterly hooked.</i>

43
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:58,033
Stupid tree.

44
00:02:58,035 --> 00:02:59,869
<i>I saw him every day.</i>

45
00:02:59,871 --> 00:03:02,575
<i>And yet,
he had no idea I even existed.</i>

46
00:03:04,276 --> 00:03:06,275
<i>Over time,
watching Charlie go by</i>

47
00:03:06,277 --> 00:03:07,913
<i>just became
a part of my routine.</i>

48
00:03:09,681 --> 00:03:11,617
<i>Along with constant
doctor appointments.</i>

49
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,785
<i>Sleeping during the day
and staying up all night,</i>

50
00:03:15,787 --> 00:03:18,488
<i>which, from what I've heard,</i>

51
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,490
<i>is the schedule
of most teenagers.</i>

52
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:24,526
<i>And playing music
every chance I get.</i>

53
00:03:24,528 --> 00:03:27,530
<i>All things considered,
I've got a pretty great life.</i>

54
00:03:27,532 --> 00:03:29,999
<i>But I still hold onto my dreams.</i>

55
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,467
Stupid tree.

56
00:03:32,469 --> 00:03:34,637
<i>No matter
how impossible they may seem.</i>

57
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,663
Jeremy Pierce.

58
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,901
Kendall Porter.

59
00:04:04,903 --> 00:04:06,035
Congratulations.

60
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,373
Peter Rathbard.

61
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:11,341
- Charles Reed.
- Yeah, Charlie!

62
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,947
Congratulations, Charlie.

63
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,649
Katie Price!

64
00:04:20,751 --> 00:04:21,818
What are you wearing?

65
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,787
Oh, cap and gown. Huh?

66
00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:26,392
The faculty and staff
always wear one.

67
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,491
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

68
00:04:30,462 --> 00:04:32,462
Most importantly,
this is for you.

69
00:04:32,464 --> 00:04:33,997
- Hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

70
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:37,402
I assume, as valedictorian,
you have a speech prepared. Yes?

71
00:04:38,135 --> 00:04:42,104
Um, yes.

72
00:04:42,106 --> 00:04:43,573
That's me
putting on my glasses.

73
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:45,040
- I like that. Nice touch.
- Thank you.

74
00:04:45,042 --> 00:04:48,477
Um, first, I would
like to thank my headmaster.

75
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,612
- Well, I mean...
- My Spanish teacher.

76
00:04:50,614 --> 00:04:51,949
<i>De nada.</i>

77
00:04:51,951 --> 00:04:54,784
- My English teacher.
- It was my pleasure.

78
00:04:54,786 --> 00:04:56,652
But I really wanna
state for the record

79
00:04:56,654 --> 00:05:00,023
that my gym teacher had absolutely
no idea what he was doing...

80
00:05:00,025 --> 00:05:03,760
What? Oh, you suck.
I lift weights.

81
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:04,931
Hey, this is for you.

82
00:05:09,968 --> 00:05:12,667
This is one of the lamest things
I've ever seen.

83
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:14,570
Yes!

84
00:05:14,572 --> 00:05:16,806
I had to go to three stores
to find something this lame.

85
00:05:16,808 --> 00:05:19,040
- I mean, it's horrific.
- Yeah! It's the worst.

86
00:05:19,042 --> 00:05:20,109
Yeah.

87
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,811
All right.

88
00:05:21,813 --> 00:05:23,813
Are you ready for your present?

89
00:05:23,815 --> 00:05:25,715
- There's a present involved?
- Oh, there's a present, yes!

90
00:05:25,717 --> 00:05:27,450
Of course, there's a present.
It's graduation...

91
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,092
This just keeps getting
better and better.

92
00:05:39,763 --> 00:05:40,999
This is Mom's.

93
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,743
Look, I know
it's kind of old,

94
00:05:53,745 --> 00:05:55,677
so if you want a newer one
I totally under...

95
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:58,016
No, I love it!
Thank you. Thank you so much.

96
00:06:06,056 --> 00:06:07,525
You look just like your mother.

97
00:06:08,859 --> 00:06:10,496
Lucky you.
She was hot.

98
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,662
Ew.

99
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:14,934
Try and get some sleep.
All right?

100
00:06:40,825 --> 00:06:43,665
I can't believe this is happening.

101
00:06:54,606 --> 00:06:55,606
Ooh.

102
00:06:57,075 --> 00:06:58,540
That's a good one.

103
00:06:58,542 --> 00:07:01,042
Uh, something weird's
going on right here.

104
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:06,715
Hey, Dad, um...
I was wondering

105
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,650
if I could go play
my new beautiful present

106
00:07:08,652 --> 00:07:09,854
at the train station
tonight.

107
00:07:12,657 --> 00:07:14,657
It's 10:00.

108
00:07:14,659 --> 00:07:16,758
Why can't Morgan just come over?
You could play here for me.

109
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,193
Morgan's busy
with her family.

110
00:07:18,195 --> 00:07:20,997
And, Dad, I love playing
for you, I really do,

111
00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:23,131
but I also need
to get used to playing

112
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:25,100
in front of
other people too.

113
00:07:25,102 --> 00:07:26,568
Please, please, please.

114
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,737
Fred will be there.
He'll watch out for me.

115
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,239
And I graduated today!

116
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:33,645
Isn't that the American
tradition, to extend my curfew?

117
00:07:37,048 --> 00:07:39,681
Okay, I'll extend
your curfew one hour.

118
00:07:39,683 --> 00:07:41,883
Which means midnight, okay?

119
00:07:41,885 --> 00:07:43,285
Hey, and text me
right when you get there,

120
00:07:43,287 --> 00:07:44,653
or I'm not
just gonna call Fred,

121
00:07:44,655 --> 00:07:45,821
I'm actually
gonna come down there.

122
00:07:45,823 --> 00:07:48,256
And it will be so embarrassing,
it'll become urban legend

123
00:07:48,258 --> 00:07:50,825
- on why kids should stick to their curfew!
- I love you.

124
00:08:07,712 --> 00:08:08,911
Oh, boy.

125
00:08:13,351 --> 00:08:16,619
Oh. Hey,
don't do that thing.

126
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:17,954
What thing?

127
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:21,590
That. I mean, you look all sad
and it makes me sad.

128
00:08:21,592 --> 00:08:23,224
Please just chug this beer
and come hang out!

129
00:08:23,226 --> 00:08:25,193
Dude, you
dodged a bullet, man.

130
00:08:25,195 --> 00:08:27,997
You were gonna be up at the ass
crack of dawn every morning

131
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:30,599
taking tests,
nowhere near the beach.

132
00:08:30,601 --> 00:08:33,134
And now, we get to do this...
our whole lives.

133
00:08:33,136 --> 00:08:36,739
Hmm, I forgot,
doing this our whole lives,

134
00:08:36,741 --> 00:08:38,501
it's way better
than a full ride to Berkeley.

135
00:08:39,209 --> 00:08:41,178
Zoe Carmichael. 3:00.

136
00:08:43,949 --> 00:08:47,349
- Charlie... you're in trouble.
- What did I do this time?

137
00:08:47,351 --> 00:08:48,918
You didn't get me a drink.

138
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,720
I did not know
you were thirsty.

139
00:08:50,722 --> 00:08:51,789
Now you do.

140
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:55,560
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

141
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,563
Is that the bad one?

142
00:08:58,795 --> 00:09:00,896
Well, now that
you're not swimming,

143
00:09:00,898 --> 00:09:04,332
maybe you'll have
a little extra time for me.

144
00:09:04,334 --> 00:09:06,134
I also have some
extra time for you.

145
00:09:06,136 --> 00:09:08,070
- And I'm not swimming.
- You were never swimming, idiot.

146
00:09:08,072 --> 00:09:09,739
Zoe! Get over here, bitch!

147
00:09:09,741 --> 00:09:11,407
Hold on!

148
00:09:11,409 --> 00:09:13,042
You're coming to
my graduation party, right?

149
00:09:13,044 --> 00:09:14,310
Yeah, I think so.

150
00:09:14,312 --> 00:09:15,312
Good.

151
00:09:16,414 --> 00:09:18,016
Yeah!

152
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,920
What... What are you doing?

153
00:09:22,886 --> 00:09:24,220
Dodging another bullet.

154
00:09:24,222 --> 00:09:26,721
Come on, dude.
It's our graduation night.

155
00:09:26,723 --> 00:09:27,725
I'm not feeling it, boys.

156
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:29,827
I'll see you later.

157
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,698
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

158
00:09:37,334 --> 00:09:38,768
Hey, yo, Fred.

159
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,101
I was wondering if I was
gonna see you tonight.

160
00:09:40,103 --> 00:09:42,370
What, and disappoint
all my fans?

161
00:11:40,124 --> 00:11:41,226
Hey.

162
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:46,930
Whoa.

163
00:11:47,966 --> 00:11:49,932
I didn't mean
to freak you out.

164
00:11:49,934 --> 00:11:50,969
Here.

165
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,805
Uh, me? I'm not freaked out.
Don't worry about it.

166
00:11:55,807 --> 00:11:57,439
- Here, I'll help you.
- I'm not a freak.

167
00:11:57,441 --> 00:11:59,874
Why are you packing up?
Where are you going?

168
00:11:59,876 --> 00:12:01,877
Um, home.
I gotta go home.

169
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:03,982
Home? Wait, you live here?

170
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:06,514
Wait, you didn't
go to Purdue High.

171
00:12:06,516 --> 00:12:08,850
No. It's a very
different school.

172
00:12:08,852 --> 00:12:12,287
And I graduated today and
my dad's a super big worrier.

173
00:12:12,289 --> 00:12:14,425
So, I really gotta...
Oh, God.

174
00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:22,130
- Um...
- I have to go.

175
00:12:22,132 --> 00:12:24,435
Wait! Wait! Whoa. What...
I'm sorry, why are you...

176
00:12:25,938 --> 00:12:26,903
What's the rush? What...

177
00:12:26,905 --> 00:12:29,872
Um, I have to get home
to my cat.

178
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,409
- Your cat.
- Yeah, it died.

179
00:12:35,111 --> 00:12:37,613
So, you're not
in a rush then, right?

180
00:12:37,615 --> 00:12:40,349
No, no, I am.
I have to plan the funeral

181
00:12:40,351 --> 00:12:43,953
for my, um, dead cat that died.

182
00:12:43,955 --> 00:12:45,489
Yeah, it's super dead.

183
00:12:48,425 --> 00:12:49,895
Wait! Wait! Wait!

184
00:12:51,428 --> 00:12:52,548
I didn't even get your name!

185
00:13:09,513 --> 00:13:12,648
You haven't noticed any changes in
her? Motor functions still seem strong?

186
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:15,316
Yeah. Yeah, no loss
of intellectual function,

187
00:13:15,318 --> 00:13:18,454
no difficulty swallowing
or talking.

188
00:13:18,456 --> 00:13:20,422
Believe me on that.

189
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:23,994
And no corneal ulcerations.

190
00:13:23,996 --> 00:13:27,599
Really, there's nothing to
suggest any neurodegeneration.

191
00:13:29,033 --> 00:13:30,431
Any exposure to sunlight?

192
00:13:30,433 --> 00:13:32,169
No, of course not.

193
00:13:33,571 --> 00:13:35,604
I'm gonna refill her
prescription for you this time,

194
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:38,086
but she really should be coming
to these appointments with you.

195
00:13:38,977 --> 00:13:41,109
Yeah, well, you know teenagers.

196
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,471
They get embarrassed
by their dads.

197
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,648
- She has XP, Jack.
- I know exactly what she has.

198
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,182
It's not gonna
fall into remission.

199
00:13:48,184 --> 00:13:50,619
And every year, the risk
becomes more serious for her.

200
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,989
So, if she's exposed to even
the slightest bit of sunlight...

201
00:13:52,991 --> 00:13:55,324
She won't be.

202
00:13:55,326 --> 00:13:57,963
- She's reached that age we talked about.
- She won't be.

203
00:14:01,432 --> 00:14:04,332
Any word on the University
of Washington study?

204
00:14:04,334 --> 00:14:08,436
I submitted Katie's name for their Phase
Two trials, if it even gets that far.

205
00:14:08,438 --> 00:14:10,571
I wouldn't get your hopes up.

206
00:14:10,573 --> 00:14:12,441
Research funding
being what it is,

207
00:14:12,443 --> 00:14:15,283
we're talking about a disease that
affects only one in a million people.

208
00:14:18,481 --> 00:14:21,252
We're in luck,
'cause she is one in a million.

209
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,525
A cat funeral?

210
00:14:28,592 --> 00:14:30,359
Please stop saying it out loud.

211
00:14:30,361 --> 00:14:32,995
No, I mean,
I've heard that dead pets

212
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,463
can actually be
an aphrodisiac.

213
00:14:34,465 --> 00:14:36,966
Morgan, what should I have said?

214
00:14:36,968 --> 00:14:39,401
Any other combination of words
in the English language.

215
00:14:39,403 --> 00:14:41,369
Like, "Hey, I'm Katie Price.

216
00:14:41,371 --> 00:14:43,538
I've watched you outside
my window for the past 10 years,

217
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,642
and I've been in love with you,
stalking you every minute of the day."

218
00:14:46,644 --> 00:14:50,244
- Okay, don't start with that...
- Or how about, "Hey, you may remember me from kindergarten,

219
00:14:50,246 --> 00:14:51,714
when everyone
called me a vampire."

220
00:14:51,716 --> 00:14:53,614
No one remembers that!

221
00:14:53,616 --> 00:14:56,685
- What did I do?
- It's bad, but we'll fix it.

222
00:14:56,687 --> 00:15:00,189
I feel so stupid and lame.

223
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:01,693
Well, at least
you have M&M's. So...

224
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:05,563
Thanks.

225
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,566
So, you've just gotta
make up for it next time.

226
00:15:10,568 --> 00:15:12,200
There's not gonna be
a next time.

227
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,039
- You don't know that.
- I do.

228
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,439
This is good.
This is what Taylor Swift does.

229
00:15:17,441 --> 00:15:19,141
She has awkward
interactions with boys,

230
00:15:19,143 --> 00:15:22,511
and then she just writes
amazing songs about it. What?

231
00:15:22,513 --> 00:15:24,713
Oh, no, no.

232
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:27,483
- Oh, come on.
- What's happening?

233
00:15:27,485 --> 00:15:28,750
Did you see my notebook
when you came in?

234
00:15:28,752 --> 00:15:31,085
Your notebook notebook? No.

235
00:15:31,087 --> 00:15:32,553
I think I left it
at the train station.

236
00:15:32,555 --> 00:15:35,356
- Oh, God.
- Can you please go get it for me?

237
00:15:35,358 --> 00:15:37,526
Morgan, it's so important.
Please.

238
00:15:37,528 --> 00:15:40,195
You know, I would,
but there's, like,

239
00:15:40,197 --> 00:15:42,557
a few other poppin' cat funerals
that I was gonna hit today.

240
00:15:43,467 --> 00:15:45,370
No, no! I'm in a corner! Oh!

241
00:15:55,779 --> 00:15:57,546
Hey.

242
00:15:57,548 --> 00:15:58,814
My friend's
been looking for that.

243
00:15:58,816 --> 00:16:00,351
You know her? Oh, wait.

244
00:16:01,684 --> 00:16:03,652
Morgan, right?
We had English class together.

245
00:16:03,654 --> 00:16:07,255
- I'm Charlie...
- Charlie Reed, yeah. I know.

246
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,623
And it was a history class.

247
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:09,825
But how do you know her?

248
00:16:09,827 --> 00:16:11,627
- Did she just move here?
- Notebook first.

249
00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:15,133
Or you could just tell me where she
lives and I could drop it off.

250
00:16:16,534 --> 00:16:17,601
I have a better idea.

251
00:16:22,573 --> 00:16:25,173
Hey, Dad, I need to go to the train
station to pick up my notebook.

252
00:16:25,175 --> 00:16:26,441
Fred has it.

253
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,413
Okay, text me when you get there
and be careful.

254
00:16:37,321 --> 00:16:38,321
Fred?

255
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,259
Holy pregnant cow.

256
00:16:45,261 --> 00:16:47,396
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

257
00:16:47,398 --> 00:16:48,663
Oh, my God.

258
00:16:48,665 --> 00:16:50,100
Thank you.

259
00:16:54,204 --> 00:16:55,369
Purdue Creamery.

260
00:16:55,371 --> 00:16:58,440
- Morgan.
- Hey. How's your second date?

261
00:16:58,442 --> 00:16:59,874
How could you do this to me?

262
00:16:59,876 --> 00:17:01,210
Oh, my God,
I'm in sweatpants.

263
00:17:01,212 --> 00:17:04,312
My hair, it's-it's a mess.
It's tied.

264
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,148
Oh, my God,
I look like an idiot.

265
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,118
Oh, please. Katie,
you're super freakin' hot, okay?

266
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,386
I can't even see you right now and
I can tell you look gorgeous.

267
00:17:11,388 --> 00:17:12,753
Hi, excuse me.
Can I just get a large...

268
00:17:12,755 --> 00:17:14,391
Can you not see
I'm on the phone?

269
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:18,793
He really likes you, okay?
I can tell.

270
00:17:18,795 --> 00:17:21,530
<i>Just try to be yourself.
Don't ramble too much.</i>

271
00:17:21,532 --> 00:17:22,798
And call me afterwards.

272
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:25,668
Bye.

273
00:17:31,307 --> 00:17:33,310
Oh, my...

274
00:17:44,822 --> 00:17:46,722
Wow, you exist.

275
00:17:46,724 --> 00:17:49,390
I thought I was dreaming
last night or something.

276
00:17:49,392 --> 00:17:52,226
Were you in the REM
stage of sleep?

277
00:17:52,228 --> 00:17:53,361
What?

278
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,863
That's when most
dreams happen, actually.

279
00:17:55,865 --> 00:17:59,234
Yeah, your brain activity
is super high and functioning,

280
00:17:59,236 --> 00:18:02,370
and your eyes are just going
nuts behind your eyelids.

281
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:05,874
It looks super weird. It's like
a typewriter or something.

282
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,543
Um, anyway, thank you for...

283
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,811
Wait, I, uh... I still
don't know your name.

284
00:18:10,813 --> 00:18:11,813
Oh.

285
00:18:12,882 --> 00:18:15,283
- It's Katie.
- Katie, I'm Charlie.

286
00:18:16,786 --> 00:18:18,786
Wow, that's a weird name.

287
00:18:18,788 --> 00:18:21,723
Thank God you told me it 'cause I
wouldn't have known it otherwise.

288
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,559
Thank you.

289
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,130
- Wait, what...
- You didn't...

290
00:18:27,966 --> 00:18:30,599
You didn't read through it,
did you?

291
00:18:30,601 --> 00:18:32,301
Uh, just a little. I...

292
00:18:32,303 --> 00:18:33,502
- What?
- What?

293
00:18:33,504 --> 00:18:35,469
Are you serious?
You read through my journal?

294
00:18:35,471 --> 00:18:37,305
- Look, I...
- This could have been a diary.

295
00:18:37,307 --> 00:18:38,908
I mean, it is, kind of.

296
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,841
Um, I'm... I'm really sorry.

297
00:18:40,843 --> 00:18:42,843
You left really quick
the other night,

298
00:18:42,845 --> 00:18:44,446
and I really had no idea
who it belonged to,

299
00:18:44,448 --> 00:18:45,847
so I just
looked through it quickly.

300
00:18:45,849 --> 00:18:47,950
But I like that you
still handwrite things.

301
00:18:47,952 --> 00:18:49,853
It's... It's cool.
It's old school.

302
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,957
Thanks... for finding it.

303
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:55,959
Yeah.

304
00:18:58,329 --> 00:18:59,761
Wait!

305
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,362
What, another cat died?
You have to...

306
00:19:01,364 --> 00:19:02,464
Oh.

307
00:19:02,466 --> 00:19:04,532
Um...

308
00:19:04,534 --> 00:19:08,803
I... I had to... I... I'm...
I'm walking home.

309
00:19:08,805 --> 00:19:09,806
Can I walk with you?

310
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,909
Um, yeah.

311
00:19:13,911 --> 00:19:17,245
So, you were home-schooled, huh?
Man, that must have been wild.

312
00:19:17,247 --> 00:19:20,015
Actually, it was the exact
opposite of wild.

313
00:19:20,017 --> 00:19:22,251
My dad's pretty protective.

314
00:19:22,253 --> 00:19:25,387
He's not, like, watching us
right now, is he?

315
00:19:25,389 --> 00:19:28,490
Oh, yeah. He has his phone
tapped into every camera.

316
00:19:31,294 --> 00:19:35,030
So, um, what did you think
of the songs you read?

317
00:19:35,032 --> 00:19:38,332
Without my permission,
I may add.

318
00:19:38,334 --> 00:19:40,638
Um, honestly, I don't know.

319
00:19:41,939 --> 00:19:43,705
I mean, you can't really
read a song, right?

320
00:19:43,707 --> 00:19:45,007
True.

321
00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:47,743
I guess I'd have
to hear you sing them.

322
00:19:47,745 --> 00:19:50,745
Um, so anyway,
I'm right up here.

323
00:19:50,747 --> 00:19:52,616
So, you don't have to walk me.

324
00:19:54,317 --> 00:19:56,484
Wait, you live up there?

325
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,052
I-I don't understand
how we've never met.

326
00:19:58,054 --> 00:19:59,553
I've probably
skated by your house,

327
00:19:59,555 --> 00:20:00,888
like, every day
on the way to practice.

328
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:04,927
It's a... funny coincidence.

329
00:20:07,563 --> 00:20:08,600
Um...

330
00:20:09,901 --> 00:20:10,901
thanks.

331
00:20:14,304 --> 00:20:16,640
Hey, you wouldn't wanna do
something sometime, would you?

332
00:20:18,409 --> 00:20:20,375
Um... together?

333
00:20:20,377 --> 00:20:23,015
Yes, us together.
Hanging out.

334
00:20:24,448 --> 00:20:27,884
Um... I'm really busy
during the day.

335
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,025
But... I could be free at night.

336
00:20:34,457 --> 00:20:35,957
I could be free at night.

337
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:39,029
Well, you should
put your number in here then.

338
00:20:42,365 --> 00:20:44,433
I'm old school too.

339
00:20:44,435 --> 00:20:45,602
Smooth.

340
00:20:46,669 --> 00:20:47,905
Thank you.

341
00:20:52,575 --> 00:20:55,345
That is so romantic
it disgusts me.

342
00:20:57,046 --> 00:20:58,546
What did he say about your XP?

343
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:00,581
It didn't come up.

344
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,384
What do you mean,
it didn't come up?

345
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,453
I-I didn't bring it up.

346
00:21:04,455 --> 00:21:06,388
I'm not gonna just
randomly be like,

347
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,657
"Hey, dude, by the way,
the sunlight's gonna..."

348
00:21:10,893 --> 00:21:14,128
Like, look when you
tell someone you're sick,

349
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:18,867
then you start to become more like
a disease and less like a person.

350
00:21:18,869 --> 00:21:21,469
It's... I'm gonna tell him,
I promise,

351
00:21:21,471 --> 00:21:23,605
but I don't know
when I'm gonna see him again.

352
00:21:23,607 --> 00:21:25,573
I do.

353
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:27,909
You know that annoying guy who works
with me at the ice cream shop?

354
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:30,947
- The nerdy one you hate?
- Yes, Garver.

355
00:21:30,949 --> 00:21:33,749
His parents are out of town tonight
and he's throwing a party.

356
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,583
And he told me to bring friends.

357
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:38,020
- So, I'm gonna bring you...
- No, no, no, no, no...

358
00:21:38,022 --> 00:21:40,589
- And you're gonna bring Charlie.
- No.

359
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:43,425
He's gotta, like, you know...

360
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:46,828
Doesn't... I have to wait
till he texts me first, right?

361
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,663
Yeah, totally.

362
00:21:48,665 --> 00:21:51,399
And then, you know, his squire will
send a note via carrier pigeon

363
00:21:51,401 --> 00:21:52,935
asking if you'd like
to merge your kingdoms.

364
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,937
What is this,
18th-century England?

365
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,737
You're a hot,
young, badass woman.

366
00:21:56,739 --> 00:21:58,943
You're gonna text him
whenever you damn well please.

367
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:01,878
Be confident, okay?

368
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,614
- Give him the facts.
- Okay.

369
00:22:14,926 --> 00:22:17,458
- Play a little hard to get.
- All right.

370
00:22:20,563 --> 00:22:22,898
Make sure that he knows he's not
the only reason you're going.

371
00:22:22,901 --> 00:22:24,499
Okay.

372
00:22:24,501 --> 00:22:25,703
All right.

373
00:22:27,939 --> 00:22:29,036
Oh, no.

374
00:22:37,613 --> 00:22:40,080
This is gonna be a tame,
safe, parent-friendly party.

375
00:22:40,082 --> 00:22:41,984
Ah-ha!
It's a totally lame party.

376
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,953
You know what we should do?
We should stay here.

377
00:22:43,955 --> 00:22:47,054
We'll get Hunan Chinese.
You guys love Hunan, right?

378
00:22:47,056 --> 00:22:48,558
Put some Netflix on.
It'll be perfect.

379
00:22:50,127 --> 00:22:52,159
Dad, you know
I'm a good kid.

380
00:22:52,161 --> 00:22:53,963
You know I'm not gonna
do anything crazy.

381
00:22:53,965 --> 00:22:56,630
But I swear,
if I spend one more night here,

382
00:22:56,632 --> 00:22:59,099
just listening to everyone else
outside my window

383
00:22:59,101 --> 00:23:02,105
living their lives,
I might go crazy.

384
00:23:04,909 --> 00:23:08,914
Tomorrow night, we can order way too much
chow mein, and have a movie marathon.

385
00:23:13,249 --> 00:23:15,716
- All right.
- Yes, thank you!

386
00:23:15,718 --> 00:23:17,619
You're the best dad
in the world.

387
00:23:17,621 --> 00:23:19,553
Thanks, Mr. P!

388
00:23:19,555 --> 00:23:23,492
Okay, um, Charlie's gonna
meet us at Garver's at 8:00.

389
00:23:23,494 --> 00:23:24,725
We have to get ready!

390
00:23:24,727 --> 00:23:25,927
Dude, what are you
talking about?

391
00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:27,832
We have, like, three hours.

392
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:30,133
We're already behind.

393
00:23:32,268 --> 00:23:33,268
Done.

394
00:23:35,171 --> 00:23:40,444
Mr. P! May I present
Katherine Price of Washington.

395
00:23:51,255 --> 00:23:52,255
Wow.

396
00:23:53,924 --> 00:23:57,959
Peanut... you look amazing.

397
00:23:59,696 --> 00:24:02,062
Bye, Mr. P!

398
00:24:08,705 --> 00:24:09,740
Let's go.

399
00:24:17,781 --> 00:24:20,021
God, I can't believe
Garver's throwing a kegger.

400
00:24:21,884 --> 00:24:23,083
You came.

401
00:24:24,621 --> 00:24:26,888
Is there any chance that you,
or your hot friend, hey,

402
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:30,724
know how to get beer
out of a keg?

403
00:24:30,726 --> 00:24:32,962
Oh, no.

404
00:24:32,964 --> 00:24:36,630
- You didn't get a tap?
- I didn't realize they were separate things.

405
00:24:36,632 --> 00:24:39,134
Why would they sell me a barrel
of beer I can't even access?

406
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:51,679
Garver! What the hell?

407
00:24:51,681 --> 00:24:54,749
This is a tame, safe,
parent-friendly party!

408
00:24:54,751 --> 00:24:57,054
Uh, do tame parties
have sundae bars?

409
00:24:58,655 --> 00:25:00,254
I think it's so cool.

410
00:25:00,256 --> 00:25:01,924
No, don't listen to her.

411
00:25:01,926 --> 00:25:03,358
Okay, she's never been
to a party before.

412
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,793
She doesn't understand
how dire the situation is.

413
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:07,262
- We gotta go.
- What, you're leaving?

414
00:25:07,264 --> 00:25:09,330
No, no, no. I just made
a huge thing of chili.

415
00:25:09,332 --> 00:25:11,366
Garver,
chili is not a party food.

416
00:25:12,835 --> 00:25:14,972
You see, the party's
just kicking off.

417
00:25:19,242 --> 00:25:21,176
What's Charlie Reed doing here?

418
00:25:21,178 --> 00:25:22,178
Oh, my God.

419
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,323
Hi.

420
00:25:39,062 --> 00:25:40,197
You look really amazing.

421
00:25:42,131 --> 00:25:44,937
Um... oh, it's all Morgan.

422
00:25:46,035 --> 00:25:47,735
No, I don't think so.

423
00:25:47,737 --> 00:25:49,905
For you, good sir.

424
00:25:49,907 --> 00:25:51,075
Oh, thank you.

425
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,407
Thank you.

426
00:25:53,409 --> 00:25:54,409
Beef chili, huh?

427
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:01,683
Mm. That's top shelf, buddy.
That's fresh.

428
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:04,785
You know, I really thought we'd
have a bigger turnout, but...

429
00:26:04,787 --> 00:26:06,754
I told you not to go
up against a cheerleader.

430
00:26:06,756 --> 00:26:08,423
What cheerleader?

431
00:26:08,425 --> 00:26:10,724
It's the mean blonde one
with a convertible.

432
00:26:10,726 --> 00:26:11,792
- Zoe Carmichael?
- Yes.

433
00:26:12,896 --> 00:26:14,728
She's having a party
tonight as well.

434
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,830
Must have dinged our turnout.

435
00:26:16,832 --> 00:26:18,065
Do you guys wanna go there?

436
00:26:18,067 --> 00:26:20,068
Well, I like the idea.

437
00:26:21,804 --> 00:26:25,874
- Hey.
- I was wondering where you were.

438
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:27,976
- Who are these people?
- Oh, these are my friends.

439
00:26:27,978 --> 00:26:30,246
And they brought you a keg.

440
00:26:34,251 --> 00:26:36,685
Great. Come on in.

441
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,903
Charlie!

442
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:56,140
Hey, what's up, man?

443
00:27:03,213 --> 00:27:04,248
You good?

444
00:27:05,482 --> 00:27:08,249
Hey, I'm gonna
go take a lap upstairs.

445
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,251
Away from you two.

446
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,353
Thank you.

447
00:27:13,355 --> 00:27:15,291
Your friend Morgan,
she seems cool.

448
00:27:16,493 --> 00:27:17,959
Yeah. She's really cool.

449
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:21,096
How long have you guys
known each other?

450
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:22,832
I don't know. Like, forever.

451
00:27:25,267 --> 00:27:27,101
- He's back.
- Oh!

452
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,736
Charlie! Whoa!

453
00:27:28,738 --> 00:27:31,438
Whoa. Who is this?

454
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,443
Uh, Owen, Wes,
this is Katie Price.

455
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:36,744
- Hey.
- Hi.

456
00:27:36,746 --> 00:27:38,746
Katie, you're... you're...

457
00:27:38,748 --> 00:27:41,984
- Um...-
- You got Charlie to come to a party,

458
00:27:41,986 --> 00:27:43,918
and make a smile-like feature.

459
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,888
Our boy hasn't looked
this good in a long time.

460
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:48,191
There you are.

461
00:27:51,194 --> 00:27:52,995
I'm still thirsty.

462
00:27:52,997 --> 00:27:54,428
Wanna get me that drink now?

463
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:58,500
I'm actually about to go take
Katie on the house party tour.

464
00:27:58,502 --> 00:28:00,301
So. You ready?

465
00:28:01,838 --> 00:28:04,038
- We'll be right back.
- Nice meeting you guys.

466
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,560
- Nice to meet you, Katie.
- Take care.

467
00:28:07,043 --> 00:28:08,523
- I can quench your thirst.
- Shut up.

468
00:28:38,976 --> 00:28:41,010
Would you like
to dance with me?

469
00:28:41,012 --> 00:28:44,579
Garver, what on earth makes you think
I'd ever want to dance with you?

470
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:55,055
You know, if you tell anyone
about this, I'll kill you.

471
00:28:55,057 --> 00:28:56,126
Totally.

472
00:29:02,232 --> 00:29:03,232
Hey, hey!

473
00:29:04,434 --> 00:29:06,099
- Hey.
- Gotta stay hydrated.

474
00:29:06,101 --> 00:29:07,138
Thank you.

475
00:29:09,305 --> 00:29:11,171
This is really interesting.

476
00:29:11,173 --> 00:29:14,444
I don't think
I've ever seen this happen.

477
00:29:15,512 --> 00:29:17,110
Yeah.

478
00:29:17,112 --> 00:29:19,948
Classic high school,
awkward party.

479
00:29:21,117 --> 00:29:22,617
I've only seen it at the movies.

480
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:24,519
I gotta show you this.
Come on.

481
00:29:24,521 --> 00:29:26,123
- Oh, God.
- Come on.

482
00:29:27,958 --> 00:29:29,960
Okay, similar
to what's going on over here.

483
00:29:31,026 --> 00:29:32,395
We just kind of hold here.

484
00:29:34,264 --> 00:29:36,867
And swing the hips awkwardly.

485
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:40,902
- Am I doing it?
- Yeah, you're kind of.

486
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,505
And then I would slowly back up.

487
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:03,993
Everybody! This is the best
night of my life! Yeah!

488
00:30:10,633 --> 00:30:11,835
You wanna go someplace else?

489
00:30:12,903 --> 00:30:13,939
Okay.

490
00:30:16,038 --> 00:30:17,338
I-I don't get it.

491
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,139
How could they just
take your scholarship away?

492
00:30:19,141 --> 00:30:21,910
Well, I had to have surgery.

493
00:30:21,912 --> 00:30:23,847
And they didn't think
I could ever swim again.

494
00:30:25,381 --> 00:30:28,116
And no more scholarship
meant no more Berkeley.

495
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:31,452
- I'm really sorry.
- Yeah.

496
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:34,522
So, how did you do it?
How did you hurt yourself?

497
00:30:34,524 --> 00:30:36,590
It was just a freak accident.

498
00:30:36,592 --> 00:30:38,394
You know, I fell down
some stairs and...

499
00:30:40,496 --> 00:30:42,397
And that's not true.

500
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,698
That's kind of what
I tell everybody.

501
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,569
I got really drunk one night
at Owen's house.

502
00:30:49,238 --> 00:30:52,943
And my friends dared me to jump
off the roof into the pool...

503
00:30:54,377 --> 00:30:56,113
and I clipped the edge
with my shoulder.

504
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:00,715
I'm such an idiot.

505
00:31:00,717 --> 00:31:02,386
I don't wanna be that guy,
you know?

506
00:31:06,488 --> 00:31:07,556
Then don't be.

507
00:31:09,994 --> 00:31:12,392
You know, my mom used to take me
here when I was little.

508
00:31:12,394 --> 00:31:17,398
- Really?
- She sat me right there.

509
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,468
And, um, she tried to teach me
how to play the guitar.

510
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:25,106
Actually, this watch was hers.

511
00:31:25,108 --> 00:31:29,042
I spent so much time looking
at this thing on her hand.

512
00:31:29,044 --> 00:31:30,413
And...

513
00:31:33,216 --> 00:31:37,517
um, she died when I was little.

514
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,722
- She was in a car accident.
- I'm-I'm so sorry.

515
00:31:40,724 --> 00:31:42,255
- You know, we can go someplace...
- No.

516
00:31:42,257 --> 00:31:45,326
No, no. No, no.
No, I'm... I'm good.

517
00:31:45,328 --> 00:31:47,933
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah. I promise.

518
00:31:50,632 --> 00:31:52,035
You wanna see
something cool?

519
00:31:54,403 --> 00:31:56,036
Ta-da!

520
00:31:56,038 --> 00:31:58,673
- This is yours?
- No.

521
00:31:58,675 --> 00:32:01,576
But it's something I'm taking
care of for the summer.

522
00:32:01,578 --> 00:32:03,711
It's a Jespersen 53.

523
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,316
Wow.

524
00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:12,486
One of these days we could take
her for a sail around the harbor,

525
00:32:12,488 --> 00:32:13,488
we can watch the sun set.

526
00:32:23,332 --> 00:32:26,402
That sounds perfect.

527
00:32:49,525 --> 00:32:52,193
Um, just, let me get out of...

528
00:32:55,732 --> 00:32:56,767
Sorry.

529
00:32:58,802 --> 00:33:00,667
So, what are
you gonna do this year,

530
00:33:00,669 --> 00:33:02,302
now that you're
not going to Berkeley?

531
00:33:02,304 --> 00:33:05,339
Well, first I'm gonna
get a new truck.

532
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:09,780
And then I'm gonna
drive across the country.

533
00:33:11,514 --> 00:33:13,548
You know, I've been in
the pool my entire life,

534
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,519
and, uh, I haven't
got to see much else, so...

535
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:21,522
- Um, what are you gonna do...
- I'm not doing anything.

536
00:33:21,524 --> 00:33:25,560
I'm just gonna take some
online courses, I think.

537
00:33:25,562 --> 00:33:29,496
But I'll just be here.

538
00:33:29,498 --> 00:33:31,267
I, uh... I meant
what are you doing tomorrow?

539
00:33:32,334 --> 00:33:35,235
Oh. Oh! Oh, God.

540
00:33:35,237 --> 00:33:38,808
Um... I...

541
00:33:41,177 --> 00:33:43,744
I'm busy during the day,

542
00:33:43,746 --> 00:33:46,481
but I can be free
tomorrow night.

543
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:47,584
That's perfect.

544
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:51,688
- I'll see you tomorrow night?
- Okay.

545
00:33:58,594 --> 00:34:00,163
I have something to tell you.

546
00:34:02,431 --> 00:34:04,532
I don't actually have a cat.

547
00:34:04,534 --> 00:34:06,567
No shit.

548
00:34:17,613 --> 00:34:21,182
- Who are you texting?
- Hmm? No one.

549
00:34:22,684 --> 00:34:27,187
- Morgan, who are you texting?
- Garver.

550
00:34:27,189 --> 00:34:28,555
Hmm?

551
00:34:28,557 --> 00:34:31,158
Um, I can't hear you
when you're whispering...

552
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,559
Garver!
I made out with Garver.

553
00:34:32,561 --> 00:34:36,564
No! He's really, really cute.

554
00:34:36,566 --> 00:34:39,633
And he totally likes you.

555
00:34:39,635 --> 00:34:44,238
By the way, can I tell my dad that
I'm going over to yours tonight,

556
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,800
so I can go hang out
with Charlie later?

557
00:34:47,944 --> 00:34:49,843
You're asking me to help you
lie to your father,

558
00:34:49,845 --> 00:34:51,045
so you can
hang out with a guy?

559
00:34:52,282 --> 00:34:54,351
I've never been
so proud of you!

560
00:34:57,186 --> 00:34:59,287
Uh, Dad, I'm gonna
go over to Morgan's tonight.

561
00:34:59,289 --> 00:35:01,488
- Is that okay?
- Yeah, yeah, no problem.

562
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:02,626
Hey, how was that party?

563
00:35:05,727 --> 00:35:07,361
Party was nice.

564
00:35:07,363 --> 00:35:08,896
Did you meet any fun people?

565
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:11,365
No. Not really.

566
00:35:11,367 --> 00:35:14,334
Everybody was kind of just,
like, ugh, you know?

567
00:35:14,336 --> 00:35:16,504
Nobody was really there.
It was just...

568
00:35:16,506 --> 00:35:18,940
- So I'm gonna...
- skedaddle.

569
00:35:18,942 --> 00:35:21,210
- Love you.
- Love you more.

570
00:35:26,215 --> 00:35:27,481
I'm lying.

571
00:35:27,483 --> 00:35:30,153
Well, you were rambling,
so I kind of figured.

572
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,528
I'm going to go meet a boy
named Charlie Reed,

573
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:42,729
who's really nice and sweet.

574
00:35:42,731 --> 00:35:46,937
And I really, really
like him... a lot.

575
00:35:48,838 --> 00:35:51,439
- Are you mad?
- I'm not happy that you lied to me.

576
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:53,441
You know you can
always tell me anything...

577
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:54,678
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

578
00:35:56,311 --> 00:35:57,946
- Do you trust this guy?
- Yes.

579
00:35:57,948 --> 00:36:00,684
- Will I hate him?
- No. No, you won't. I promise.

580
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:03,951
- Does he know about your...
- I haven't told him yet.

581
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:05,352
- No, Katie...
- But I will...

582
00:36:05,354 --> 00:36:07,421
No, I am not comfortable
with him not knowing.

583
00:36:07,423 --> 00:36:12,026
I know, I'm going to. I just
need a little bit longer of...

584
00:36:12,028 --> 00:36:15,698
- What?
- ...being someone more than just a disease.

585
00:36:18,002 --> 00:36:21,535
- Katie.
- It's just a few more days, please?

586
00:36:21,537 --> 00:36:23,207
Like a normal girl.

587
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,341
Hey.

588
00:36:27,343 --> 00:36:30,278
Is it okay if me and Katie hang out
tonight together, the entire night?

589
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,745
I already
admitted everything.

590
00:36:31,747 --> 00:36:33,915
What, you couldn't
make it two hours?

591
00:36:33,917 --> 00:36:36,753
It's pathetic.
I could've made it two hours.

592
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:45,459
What does Katie Price
wanna do?

593
00:36:45,461 --> 00:36:47,595
There are so
many things I wanna do.

594
00:36:48,731 --> 00:36:50,631
I have always
wanted to do this.

595
00:37:01,477 --> 00:37:03,410
Ready?

596
00:37:49,926 --> 00:37:51,794
What about that one over there?

597
00:37:52,829 --> 00:37:54,962
Um, that one's called Altair.

598
00:37:54,964 --> 00:37:57,430
And it's 16 light years away,

599
00:37:57,432 --> 00:37:59,600
which means the light
we're seeing now,

600
00:37:59,602 --> 00:38:01,082
was actually created
when we were two.

601
00:38:05,073 --> 00:38:06,073
Are you okay?

602
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:11,949
The Berkeley coach called
my house the other night.

603
00:38:13,483 --> 00:38:14,782
Really?

604
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:17,484
Yeah, I mean, I guess
one of the other swimmers

605
00:38:17,486 --> 00:38:21,325
transferred out
and another spot opened up.

606
00:38:22,157 --> 00:38:24,057
Wow.

607
00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:26,394
That's so crazy.
You could get your spot back?

608
00:38:26,396 --> 00:38:28,731
I mean, technically, yeah.

609
00:38:30,166 --> 00:38:31,933
There's this huge meet
coming up next month,

610
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:35,169
and the Berkeley coach
is coming down to watch.

611
00:38:35,171 --> 00:38:37,938
But I'd have to get in shape by
then, which is probably impossible.

612
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:41,041
And then I'd have to swim, like, my best
time ever to show that I'm fully rehabbed...

613
00:38:41,043 --> 00:38:42,713
You can totally do it.

614
00:38:50,485 --> 00:38:52,989
There's also some reasons
to stick around here next year.

615
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,130
Katie, I wanna take you
on a real date tomorrow.

616
00:39:01,863 --> 00:39:02,865
Okay.

617
00:39:05,168 --> 00:39:08,604
And you also need
to meet my dad.

618
00:39:16,111 --> 00:39:17,978
Why don't you move
a little closer there, Cody?

619
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,613
My-My name's Charlie.

620
00:39:19,615 --> 00:39:20,747
- Charlie.
- Yeah.

621
00:39:20,749 --> 00:39:22,485
Huh. I didn't know that.

622
00:39:24,787 --> 00:39:29,088
Is that what you go by? You go by Charlie
and not Chuck or Chuckie or C-Town?

623
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:32,027
- No, sir, I... just Charlie.
- Charlie, okay.

624
00:39:33,762 --> 00:39:35,662
- You ever been arrested?
- No, sir.

625
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:37,164
- When's your curfew?
- It's 1:00 a.m.

626
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:40,166
- What time do you actually get home?
- Like, 2:00.

627
00:39:40,168 --> 00:39:41,801
That's not one 1:00,
is it, Charlie?

628
00:39:41,803 --> 00:39:43,570
- No, sir, it's not.
- You said your curfew was 1:00.

629
00:39:43,572 --> 00:39:45,472
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

630
00:39:45,474 --> 00:39:47,177
Relax, I'm not a cop.

631
00:39:50,913 --> 00:39:52,613
How many times
a week do you shave?

632
00:39:52,615 --> 00:39:57,953
Shave, uh, like four...
four times a week, sir.

633
00:39:57,955 --> 00:39:59,020
- Who's your team?
- Seahawks.

634
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:00,254
Why?

635
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,888
Well, because they're great.

636
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:04,158
And one time I was
at this burger place and...

637
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,496
Richard Sherman actually
ate some of my fries.

638
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:09,599
That's awesome.

639
00:40:10,832 --> 00:40:14,570
Okay. Charlie, here's the deal.

640
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:20,073
Katie appears to be
very strong, and she is.

641
00:40:20,075 --> 00:40:21,809
- Hey.
- She's dealing with...

642
00:40:21,811 --> 00:40:22,911
- Hi.
- Hey.

643
00:40:22,913 --> 00:40:24,512
- What you guys talking about?
- Nothing.

644
00:40:24,514 --> 00:40:27,080
- We were...
- We're just getting to know each other.

645
00:40:27,082 --> 00:40:28,816
Thank you so much for letting me
take her out, Mr. Price.

646
00:40:28,818 --> 00:40:29,818
Okay.

647
00:40:30,987 --> 00:40:32,122
Oh, don't forget your...

648
00:40:33,856 --> 00:40:35,525
guitar case.

649
00:40:36,592 --> 00:40:38,960
Wait, I'll hold it for you.

650
00:40:38,962 --> 00:40:42,466
Uh, hold on a second.
I wanna get a picture of this.

651
00:40:43,633 --> 00:40:44,868
Okay.

652
00:40:46,102 --> 00:40:50,771
All right. Just a little.
There you go.

653
00:40:50,773 --> 00:40:52,740
A little room
for the Holy Ghost.

654
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:54,541
And...

655
00:40:54,543 --> 00:40:56,846
And... open.

656
00:41:00,148 --> 00:41:01,917
I believe
these are for you.

657
00:41:01,919 --> 00:41:02,987
Wait.

658
00:41:04,287 --> 00:41:07,022
- Where are we going?
- I know nothing.

659
00:41:07,024 --> 00:41:08,289
Fred.

660
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:10,494
- Don't even try.
- Thank you, Fred.

661
00:41:13,931 --> 00:41:15,062
Okay, rule number one.

662
00:41:15,064 --> 00:41:16,829
When you're on a train,

663
00:41:16,831 --> 00:41:19,867
you must always travel with
Chinese food out of a backpack.

664
00:41:19,869 --> 00:41:23,202
Well, I wouldn't know. I've
never been on a train before.

665
00:41:23,204 --> 00:41:24,604
Neither have I.

666
00:41:24,606 --> 00:41:25,910
- Really?
- Really.

667
00:41:28,677 --> 00:41:29,677
Cheers.

668
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:36,850
I still cannot believe that we grew up
in the same town since we were younger,

669
00:41:36,852 --> 00:41:38,318
and I've never seen you
out riding your bike,

670
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,086
or out with a lemonade stand.

671
00:41:40,088 --> 00:41:41,588
And I would've
bought your lemonade.

672
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:44,057
No, you wouldn't have.
I don't like lemonade.

673
00:41:44,059 --> 00:41:45,024
Who doesn't like lemonade?

674
00:41:45,026 --> 00:41:46,530
Me.

675
00:41:47,762 --> 00:41:49,242
You know I know
the real story, right?

676
00:41:50,901 --> 00:41:53,867
You and your dad are in
the witness protection program.

677
00:41:53,869 --> 00:41:56,189
And you have both testified
against a mobster.

678
00:41:57,372 --> 00:42:02,211
Very close,
but, uh, the truth is...

679
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:07,280
I've been sent here
to monitor you.

680
00:42:07,282 --> 00:42:11,885
Right, and I've been given specific
instructions to never be seen in the daylight,

681
00:42:11,887 --> 00:42:16,624
and I've been watching you this whole
entire time from the safety of my own room.

682
00:42:16,626 --> 00:42:19,859
Classic witness protection
program cover story.

683
00:42:21,631 --> 00:42:23,935
All right, close your eyes
and put your hands out.

684
00:42:27,403 --> 00:42:28,572
Okay.

685
00:42:31,773 --> 00:42:33,075
And open.

686
00:42:36,412 --> 00:42:38,348
- Try and catch 'em in your mouth.
- Hey.

687
00:42:41,784 --> 00:42:42,818
Thank you.

688
00:42:43,785 --> 00:42:45,818
Oh, and look. We're here.

689
00:43:11,982 --> 00:43:13,216
Wait, where are you taking me?

690
00:43:14,115 --> 00:43:15,849
We're here.

691
00:43:15,851 --> 00:43:18,419
Charlie, what is this place?

692
00:43:18,421 --> 00:43:21,187
- It's your surprise.
- Charlie, my man.

693
00:43:21,189 --> 00:43:22,991
I thought Seattle
was my surprise.

694
00:43:24,325 --> 00:43:25,725
Come on.

695
00:43:25,727 --> 00:43:28,262
Where are we going?

696
00:43:37,305 --> 00:43:40,106
- It's your first live show.
- Yeah.

697
00:44:06,235 --> 00:44:07,336
Whoo!

698
00:44:08,137 --> 00:44:09,303
So cool.

699
00:44:09,305 --> 00:44:11,137
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

700
00:44:11,139 --> 00:44:13,407
That was seriously so cool.

701
00:44:13,409 --> 00:44:15,341
I know.

702
00:44:15,343 --> 00:44:18,879
That was, I mean, literally
one of the best things ever.

703
00:44:18,881 --> 00:44:21,448
- Right?
- Oh, God.

704
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,087
Live music is beautiful.

705
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:26,754
You're beautiful.

706
00:44:26,756 --> 00:44:27,958
You're the best.

707
00:44:30,926 --> 00:44:33,028
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

708
00:44:35,164 --> 00:44:37,998
Okay. Your turn.

709
00:44:39,434 --> 00:44:40,803
For what?

710
00:44:43,204 --> 00:44:44,973
Oh!

711
00:44:44,975 --> 00:44:46,439
No, no, no, no, no...

712
00:44:46,441 --> 00:44:48,878
- Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes...
- I am not...

713
00:44:50,111 --> 00:44:54,481
- You owe me a song.
- I can't do it... here.

714
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:56,016
Yes, you can.

715
00:44:56,018 --> 00:44:58,050
Remember?
Live shows are the best.

716
00:44:58,052 --> 00:45:00,220
Are you hungry?
'Cause I'm hungry.

717
00:45:00,222 --> 00:45:01,989
And you're always hungry.

718
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:08,028
Look, we can either have come
all the way to this new city,

719
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:10,968
underneath the stars
and you don't play me a song...

720
00:45:12,834 --> 00:45:15,738
or we can continue to have
the greatest night of our lives.

721
00:45:21,276 --> 00:45:23,146
I'll be right here watching.

722
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:31,454
Go. Come on, we're waiting.

723
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:51,267
She's good.

724
00:46:56,906 --> 00:46:59,205
Whoo!

725
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:38,477
Okay, I probably would have
said you were good no matter what,

726
00:47:38,479 --> 00:47:42,182
but you were really,
really good.

727
00:47:42,184 --> 00:47:44,718
You know, you have to do
something with your music.

728
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,256
- No, I couldn't.
- You have to, Katie. It was amazing.

729
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:52,124
Are you ready?

730
00:47:52,126 --> 00:47:54,061
For what?

731
00:47:54,063 --> 00:47:55,430
To go swimming.

732
00:47:57,032 --> 00:47:59,332
No, Katie, you know
I don't swim anymore.

733
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:02,436
Yes, you do. You just
haven't swam in a while.

734
00:48:02,438 --> 00:48:05,204
And I've never swam
in this water before,

735
00:48:05,206 --> 00:48:07,740
so you're gonna take me.

736
00:48:07,742 --> 00:48:09,144
Uh-huh.

737
00:48:10,479 --> 00:48:12,611
- Come on!
- No, I'm serious. I'm not swimming.

738
00:48:12,613 --> 00:48:14,747
But you made me sing
and I didn't want to.

739
00:48:14,749 --> 00:48:16,649
- That was totally different.
- No, it's not!

740
00:48:16,651 --> 00:48:19,989
Okay, do you have any idea
how cold that water is?

741
00:48:21,055 --> 00:48:22,358
Charlie.

742
00:48:24,293 --> 00:48:27,361
We could've either come
all the way to the beach

743
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:30,530
under the beautiful stars
and not go swimming,

744
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:34,401
or we could
jump into that water

745
00:48:34,403 --> 00:48:37,269
and continue to make this
the best night of our lives.

746
00:48:37,271 --> 00:48:39,708
- I don't have a swimsuit.
- Neither do I.

747
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:46,448
Katie.

748
00:48:49,117 --> 00:48:50,117
You coming?

749
00:48:57,026 --> 00:48:58,094
Hurry up!

750
00:49:00,695 --> 00:49:02,331
Oh, my God. It's so cold.

751
00:49:06,468 --> 00:49:09,472
Put your arms forward
and then push.

752
00:49:11,807 --> 00:49:14,744
The breast stroke? It seems like a trick.

753
00:49:18,514 --> 00:49:20,747
Kinda.

754
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:24,587
See, this isn't so bad.
You don't hate the water.

755
00:49:28,322 --> 00:49:30,058
I don't hate anything
when I'm with you.

756
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:51,765
<i>Have you thought any
more about your Berkeley spot?</i>

757
00:49:53,581 --> 00:49:55,117
No.

758
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:02,789
You know, I just keep thinking
about after the surgery,

759
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:04,526
when I couldn't swim.

760
00:50:08,597 --> 00:50:11,367
You know, I just realized
I didn't even know who I was.

761
00:50:13,102 --> 00:50:14,737
And neither
did anybody else.

762
00:50:17,872 --> 00:50:22,175
All these kids that I've been going
to school with for 15 years, they...

763
00:50:22,177 --> 00:50:24,213
they just saw me
as that guy in the pool.

764
00:50:28,584 --> 00:50:30,820
I don't have to live
that life anymore.

765
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,155
You know...

766
00:50:34,423 --> 00:50:36,292
you're not the guy
in the pool.

767
00:50:37,758 --> 00:50:42,398
But you're not the guy
that doesn't try either.

768
00:50:49,403 --> 00:50:53,443
Do everything you can
right now and then decide.

769
00:50:55,244 --> 00:50:57,246
'Cause now
is all that matters.

770
00:51:02,818 --> 00:51:04,550
You're right.

771
00:51:04,552 --> 00:51:06,188
Okay.

772
00:51:10,726 --> 00:51:12,626
Speaking of tomorrow morning,

773
00:51:12,628 --> 00:51:14,729
ready for the greatest sunrise
on the planet?

774
00:51:19,168 --> 00:51:20,602
What?

775
00:51:22,906 --> 00:51:24,474
Charlie, what time is it?

776
00:51:28,709 --> 00:51:29,811
It's 4:50.

777
00:51:32,613 --> 00:51:34,483
It's not waterproof.

778
00:51:39,588 --> 00:51:41,287
- Oh, my God.
- What?

779
00:51:41,289 --> 00:51:42,856
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Katie, wait!

780
00:51:42,858 --> 00:51:43,958
- Shit.
- What are you doing?

781
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,628
- I need to go!
- Katie, wait! Katie!

782
00:51:50,264 --> 00:51:51,733
Katie!

783
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:57,572
Shit.

784
00:52:06,247 --> 00:52:07,447
Hey, get in. Let me drive you.

785
00:52:09,718 --> 00:52:12,885
Go, Charlie, go!

786
00:52:12,887 --> 00:52:14,454
Katie!

787
00:52:14,456 --> 00:52:16,488
- What the hell is going on?
- You don't understand.

788
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:18,892
- You have to go as fast as you can!
- Okay, I'm going. I'm going.

789
00:52:18,894 --> 00:52:21,695
- Katie, what...
- Please just go, Charlie.

790
00:52:21,697 --> 00:52:23,363
- You're scaring me.
- You have to speed! Faster!

791
00:52:23,365 --> 00:52:24,365
Okay, okay!

792
00:52:27,401 --> 00:52:28,403
Oh, my God.

793
00:52:29,371 --> 00:52:31,273
Katie!

794
00:52:32,007 --> 00:52:33,441
Katie!

795
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:38,247
Katie!

796
00:52:40,715 --> 00:52:42,584
Katie. Katie!

797
00:52:43,818 --> 00:52:46,419
Katie.

798
00:52:46,421 --> 00:52:48,354
Oh.

799
00:52:48,356 --> 00:52:50,256
Katie, will you please
just talk to me?

800
00:52:52,928 --> 00:52:54,996
- Katie, please, just talk to me!
- Hey!

801
00:52:54,998 --> 00:52:57,363
- Is she inside?
- Yes.

802
00:52:57,365 --> 00:52:58,833
Is she in there? Move!
Just move!

803
00:53:00,602 --> 00:53:02,769
- How could you let this happen to her?
- Let what happen?

804
00:53:02,771 --> 00:53:04,570
What happened?

805
00:53:04,572 --> 00:53:06,906
She not... tell you?

806
00:53:06,908 --> 00:53:10,510
- Tell me what? I have no idea what's going on!
- She's sick. She's sick.

807
00:53:10,512 --> 00:53:13,280
- What do you mean she's sick?
- She has XP.

808
00:53:13,282 --> 00:53:16,383
She can't go in the sun at all.
It can kill her. I'm sorry.

809
00:53:16,385 --> 00:53:18,854
Katie?

810
00:53:40,309 --> 00:53:43,642
This is a nice hospital.

811
00:53:43,644 --> 00:53:45,648
I bet they have
really good food.

812
00:53:48,316 --> 00:53:49,751
Katie Price?

813
00:53:50,885 --> 00:53:52,022
We're ready.

814
00:54:09,671 --> 00:54:11,774
It was like a second, if that.

815
00:54:12,942 --> 00:54:14,807
Okay?
Everything's gonna be fine.

816
00:54:14,809 --> 00:54:16,044
We're good, Mr. P.

817
00:54:20,682 --> 00:54:22,448
Hey.

818
00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:23,785
Is she okay?

819
00:54:42,503 --> 00:54:44,870
Okay, Katie, you can sit up. Nurse
Jane will take you back outside.

820
00:54:44,872 --> 00:54:47,977
Um, actually, I wanna stay.

821
00:54:50,479 --> 00:54:54,446
Okay. The sunlight exposure
was minimal.

822
00:54:54,448 --> 00:54:57,751
The physical effects you're
seeing right now will heal.

823
00:54:57,753 --> 00:55:02,488
<i>But, as you know, XP generally lies
dormant until there's a triggering event.</i>

824
00:55:02,490 --> 00:55:04,390
We won't know if
that's what this was

825
00:55:04,392 --> 00:55:06,912
until we get the results back from
your blood work and CT scans.

826
00:55:08,463 --> 00:55:10,497
And if this was
a triggering event?

827
00:55:10,499 --> 00:55:13,533
<i>We'll cross that bridge if we come to it.</i>

828
00:55:13,535 --> 00:55:15,667
<i>If you experience
any symptoms...</i>

829
00:55:15,669 --> 00:55:19,506
unexpected shaking, muscular
pain, loss of motor function,

830
00:55:19,508 --> 00:55:21,474
you need to let us know
immediately.

831
00:55:21,476 --> 00:55:24,013
Okay. I'm gonna go
get dressed now.

832
00:55:26,481 --> 00:55:29,816
I'm pretty busy during the day,
but I could be free at night.

833
00:55:31,787 --> 00:55:34,153
I can be free at night.

834
00:55:34,155 --> 00:55:35,890
<i>My dad's super protective.</i>

835
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:40,526
What about UW?

836
00:55:40,528 --> 00:55:42,595
<i>What about the study? Have
they started the second phase?</i>

837
00:55:42,597 --> 00:55:45,133
I followed up with them
last week. No news yet.

838
00:55:47,568 --> 00:55:49,604
Okay. Thanks.

839
00:55:59,213 --> 00:56:01,150
All right, Charlie.
Let's get back to work.

840
00:56:19,633 --> 00:56:23,273
Look, I know I told you to play hard to get, but
you should at least see what he has to say.

841
00:56:30,177 --> 00:56:32,948
- He's asking if he can come over and talk to you.
- Don't.

842
00:56:34,615 --> 00:56:36,115
Please just delete them.

843
00:56:36,117 --> 00:56:37,850
Katie.

844
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:41,254
Look, if I read them,
then I'm gonna reply,

845
00:56:41,256 --> 00:56:45,524
then he's gonna reply
and then we're gonna meet up.

846
00:56:45,526 --> 00:56:47,126
Which we can't.

847
00:56:47,128 --> 00:56:48,929
Why can't you? I...

848
00:56:48,931 --> 00:56:51,231
You don't have to be a martyr just
to protect Charlie's feelings.

849
00:56:51,233 --> 00:56:53,198
He's a big boy.
I'm sure he can handle it.

850
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,037
I can't handle it.
Okay?

851
00:56:58,773 --> 00:57:01,841
He's gonna get hurt, and I'm not
gonna be the one who hurts him.

852
00:57:01,843 --> 00:57:03,712
So, please, can you
just delete them?

853
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:10,552
Yeah. Okay.

854
00:57:55,796 --> 00:57:58,097
We should do
another set of tests.

855
00:57:58,099 --> 00:58:00,300
The results could
come back different.

856
00:58:00,302 --> 00:58:02,869
Her brain has begun to contract.

857
00:58:02,871 --> 00:58:05,137
- Once the neural pathways...
- What about the study?

858
00:58:05,139 --> 00:58:08,073
They shut it down, Jack.

859
00:58:08,075 --> 00:58:11,179
I found out this morning.
There's no funding.

860
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:27,126
No, I...

861
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:29,631
I did everything
I was supposed to do.

862
00:58:33,802 --> 00:58:36,539
I mean, from the time
she was very young...

863
00:58:38,007 --> 00:58:39,675
no matter how much she...

864
00:58:41,276 --> 00:58:42,811
cried...

865
00:58:43,845 --> 00:58:45,982
or screamed or moaned...

866
00:58:47,015 --> 00:58:48,249
I wouldn't let her
go outside.

867
00:58:54,255 --> 00:58:56,624
I wouldn't let her
go to the park.

868
00:58:57,993 --> 00:59:01,260
I wouldn't even let her
go to the beach.

869
00:59:01,262 --> 00:59:03,729
And she begged me.

870
00:59:03,731 --> 00:59:05,266
She begged me...

871
00:59:08,736 --> 00:59:11,037
for things that
she had every right to.

872
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:13,275
And I denied her
all of it.

873
00:59:14,376 --> 00:59:17,042
I mean, for what? Huh?

874
00:59:17,044 --> 00:59:19,682
For this? No.

875
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:39,666
XP is a disease that tends to
take the joy from a child's life.

876
00:59:39,668 --> 00:59:41,233
In all these years
I've treated Katie,

877
00:59:41,235 --> 00:59:44,202
she's never complained,
she's never sulked.

878
00:59:44,204 --> 00:59:46,275
She always sees
the good in things.

879
00:59:49,110 --> 00:59:51,811
And the way
she talks about you?

880
00:59:51,813 --> 00:59:55,249
I've never seen a teenager
so openly adore her father.

881
00:59:58,987 --> 01:00:01,024
You're a good father, Jack.

882
01:00:04,858 --> 01:00:06,061
How long?

883
01:00:07,361 --> 01:00:08,964
It's hard to say for sure.

884
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:33,946
- Hey, kiddo.
- Hey, Dad.

885
01:01:33,948 --> 01:01:36,984
I'm starving.
Wanna get some Chinese?

886
01:01:36,986 --> 01:01:39,885
- Uh, "yuh."
- Is that a yeah?

887
01:01:39,887 --> 01:01:41,355
What are you doing?

888
01:01:42,791 --> 01:01:45,059
I'm starting you
an online dating profile.

889
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,829
- What?
- Yeah.

890
01:01:49,164 --> 01:01:52,064
Look, okay.
So, I have this photo of you,

891
01:01:52,066 --> 01:01:53,899
which I think your hair
looks better in.

892
01:01:53,902 --> 01:01:57,135
- But then in this one you have your camera.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

893
01:01:57,137 --> 01:02:00,007
- This is not happening.
- No, no, no. This <i>is</i> happening.

894
01:02:00,009 --> 01:02:01,909
Here, just take a seat.
Wanna help me write it?

895
01:02:01,911 --> 01:02:04,343
Oh, I don't know.

896
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:07,546
Okay, uh,
here's what I have so far.

897
01:02:07,548 --> 01:02:12,050
- "World's greatest father and handsomest photographer."
- Oh, veto.

898
01:02:12,052 --> 01:02:14,253
"Looking for a fellow adventurer

899
01:02:14,255 --> 01:02:19,191
interested in art, photography and
nostalgia about the Supersonics."

900
01:02:19,193 --> 01:02:22,394
- Supersonics is good. That's important.
- I knew you would like that.

901
01:02:22,396 --> 01:02:26,400
- Um, "a partner in crime to travel the world with."
- I don't travel, honey.

902
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:30,006
Uh, you will though.

903
01:02:34,309 --> 01:02:36,009
All right,
we're not doing this.

904
01:02:36,011 --> 01:02:38,781
Please, please, please,
I want to.

905
01:02:42,217 --> 01:02:44,186
You lost Mom and now
you're gonna lose me too.

906
01:02:53,126 --> 01:02:56,128
No. No, there's
always a chance.

907
01:02:56,130 --> 01:02:59,398
We've always known it's
a matter of when and not if.

908
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:04,305
So I really need you
to be selfish and...

909
01:03:06,039 --> 01:03:09,475
go out there and, you know,
take those beautiful photos

910
01:03:09,477 --> 01:03:11,410
and start traveling
the world again.

911
01:03:11,412 --> 01:03:14,379
- I want everyone to see your photos, Dad.
- Just stop.

912
01:03:14,381 --> 01:03:17,883
Okay, I can't...
I can't...

913
01:03:17,885 --> 01:03:19,887
I just want you...

914
01:03:21,588 --> 01:03:24,490
to promise me that you're
gonna take care of yourself.

915
01:03:24,492 --> 01:03:28,229
I really want you to have as happy
a life as the one you've given me.

916
01:03:29,363 --> 01:03:31,597
And try and find someone

917
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:35,334
that you can share these
incredible adventures with.

918
01:03:35,336 --> 01:03:38,007
Because having someone...

919
01:03:41,476 --> 01:03:43,278
that's the best part.

920
01:03:44,678 --> 01:03:49,450
So please, just pick
a rando lady and take her out.

921
01:03:54,188 --> 01:03:56,022
Okay.

922
01:03:56,024 --> 01:03:57,391
Okay.

923
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:00,629
- Promise me.
- I promise.

924
01:04:06,334 --> 01:04:07,971
Good.

925
01:04:11,405 --> 01:04:13,942
Now we can order Chinese food.

926
01:04:16,011 --> 01:04:19,211
- Come on!
- That was so a ball.

927
01:04:19,213 --> 01:04:22,080
That's... That's not even baseball.
I don't know what that is.

928
01:04:26,486 --> 01:04:31,126
Oh, food. Finally. What took them so long?

929
01:04:37,398 --> 01:04:41,000
Oh, my God.
Charlie's outside.

930
01:04:41,002 --> 01:04:43,202
I know. I called him.

931
01:04:43,204 --> 01:04:45,637
What? Why?

932
01:04:45,639 --> 01:04:47,141
Because...

933
01:04:49,276 --> 01:04:52,244
you said the best part was having
someone to share your adventures with.

934
01:04:52,246 --> 01:04:56,984
So, go talk to him.
Tell him the truth.

935
01:04:56,986 --> 01:04:59,517
He deserves that.

936
01:04:59,519 --> 01:05:01,255
And so do you.

937
01:05:09,097 --> 01:05:10,564
You exist.

938
01:05:12,166 --> 01:05:14,102
This time I was positive
I dreamt you.

939
01:05:17,472 --> 01:05:19,271
Charlie, I'm so sorry.

940
01:05:19,273 --> 01:05:22,240
Katie, this isn't something you
can just not tell me.

941
01:05:22,242 --> 01:05:26,512
I'm so, so sorry
I didn't tell you.

942
01:05:26,514 --> 01:05:27,716
That's...

943
01:05:31,084 --> 01:05:35,490
unforgivable and
very selfish on my part.

944
01:05:38,626 --> 01:05:41,063
We were never gonna work.

945
01:05:42,497 --> 01:05:44,099
But I wanted us to.

946
01:05:45,633 --> 01:05:48,136
You, me, we...

947
01:05:49,669 --> 01:05:52,139
we don't win in the end.

948
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:55,341
So...

949
01:05:55,343 --> 01:05:56,745
So I'm saying good-bye,
Charlie.

950
01:06:00,213 --> 01:06:01,482
Good-bye.

951
01:06:09,157 --> 01:06:11,724
You know, that was the worst
break-up speech I've ever heard.

952
01:06:11,726 --> 01:06:15,294
- What?
- Yeah. Like a D-minus would be generous.

953
01:06:15,296 --> 01:06:17,695
Zeros from all the judges Katie.
It was a total flop.

954
01:06:17,697 --> 01:06:20,599
I've never done this before!
What do you expect?

955
01:06:22,202 --> 01:06:25,606
Seriously, Charlie.
We can't.

956
01:06:27,675 --> 01:06:29,276
We can.

957
01:06:38,218 --> 01:06:39,787
What I can't do...

958
01:06:41,155 --> 01:06:43,189
I can't stop being with you.

959
01:06:43,191 --> 01:06:46,591
Katie, I've done
my research on XP.

960
01:06:46,593 --> 01:06:49,361
I know what it is. I know
what you are going through.

961
01:06:49,363 --> 01:06:52,231
But we're not the couple
who doesn't try.

962
01:06:52,233 --> 01:06:54,468
You knew that before I did.

963
01:07:06,314 --> 01:07:08,613
You've changed my life, Katie.

964
01:07:08,615 --> 01:07:10,935
Okay, you can either just leave
me here on this porch or...

965
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:15,289
or we can have the best summer
of our lives.

966
01:07:17,691 --> 01:07:19,390
What's it gonna be?

967
01:08:07,207 --> 01:08:08,610
Go, Charlie! Push it!

968
01:08:11,878 --> 01:08:13,347
Go, Charlie!

969
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:21,889
That's it, Charlie! Come on!

970
01:08:25,393 --> 01:08:28,327
- Charlie, let's go!
- Whoo! Whoo!

971
01:08:28,329 --> 01:08:32,299
Go, Charlie!
Come on, Charlie! Go! Go!

972
01:08:37,571 --> 01:08:39,437
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yeah!

973
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:41,908
Yeah!

974
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:43,644
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

975
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:49,248
The Berkeley coach was impressed and
they promised to keep in touch.

976
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:52,717
In touch is good. They'll be in touch.
I'm so proud of you, honey.

977
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:54,688
- Ahh.
- So good.

978
01:08:58,459 --> 01:08:59,959
Hey, I'll be right back.

979
01:08:59,961 --> 01:09:01,329
Sure.

980
01:09:03,830 --> 01:09:05,763
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hi.

981
01:09:05,765 --> 01:09:08,601
- The rumors are true. Congrats.
- Thank you.

982
01:09:08,603 --> 01:09:11,273
- You were great in there.
- Thank you for letting Katie come.

983
01:09:12,305 --> 01:09:13,674
I couldn't
have stopped her.

984
01:09:14,775 --> 01:09:16,874
Mr. Price,

985
01:09:16,876 --> 01:09:18,596
would you mind if I took
Katie out tomorrow?

986
01:09:21,848 --> 01:09:23,782
Yeah.

987
01:09:23,784 --> 01:09:25,516
Yeah, I think
that'd be fine.

988
01:09:25,518 --> 01:09:26,687
Thank you.

989
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:08,862
- Come on. Come on.
- I'm so confused. What are we...

990
01:10:17,705 --> 01:10:20,038
- What is this?
- It's for you.

991
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:22,341
- Is this Katie?
- Yeah.

992
01:10:22,343 --> 01:10:24,842
Let's do this.

993
01:10:24,844 --> 01:10:28,079
- No. Oh, my God, no.
- Katie. Katie, yes.

994
01:10:28,081 --> 01:10:29,815
- No, I can't. I can't.
- Yes, yes, yes. Yes.

995
01:10:29,817 --> 01:10:31,419
Yes.

996
01:10:33,387 --> 01:10:36,888
This is so crazy. How... How
did you even pay for this?

997
01:10:36,890 --> 01:10:39,824
- Don't worry about it.
- Charlie, your truck money?

998
01:10:39,826 --> 01:10:41,960
- I can't let you...
- Katie, it's already done.

999
01:10:41,962 --> 01:10:47,035
Okay, you helped me figure out my
dreams and now it's payback time.

1000
01:10:49,036 --> 01:10:51,102
I can't play anymore.

1001
01:10:51,104 --> 01:10:53,275
Then just sing.

1002
01:11:00,916 --> 01:11:02,981
Whenever you're ready, Katie.

1003
01:11:02,983 --> 01:11:05,484
Let's lay one down.

1004
01:11:05,486 --> 01:11:06,922
Thank you.

1005
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:11,824
How did you get this?

1006
01:11:11,826 --> 01:11:14,827
Uh, this is the song I've been working on.

1007
01:11:14,829 --> 01:11:17,064
Stole your notebook again.

1008
01:12:34,707 --> 01:12:35,978
- Oh.
- Oh, no.

1009
01:12:37,076 --> 01:12:38,911
Yeah, really good job.

1010
01:12:38,913 --> 01:12:40,881
Let me count our chips.

1011
01:12:48,989 --> 01:12:51,759
- That one.
- That one?

1012
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:55,127
That's Charlinium,

1013
01:12:55,129 --> 01:12:59,698
because it is huge and powerful.

1014
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:03,202
And that one
is my favorite.

1015
01:13:03,204 --> 01:13:06,538
That one is Burritorium,

1016
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:08,643
because it's shaped
like a burrito.

1017
01:13:09,876 --> 01:13:12,043
That one is Procyon.

1018
01:13:12,045 --> 01:13:14,081
It's 11 light years away.

1019
01:13:15,549 --> 01:13:19,086
So we were seven
when that light was made.

1020
01:13:22,121 --> 01:13:26,760
That was, um, right around the time
you got your first skateboard.

1021
01:13:29,629 --> 01:13:30,629
What?

1022
01:13:34,067 --> 01:13:37,204
Charlie, that night we met
at the train station...

1023
01:13:38,872 --> 01:13:40,906
I already knew you.

1024
01:13:40,908 --> 01:13:42,776
Wh-What do you mean?

1025
01:13:44,678 --> 01:13:47,712
In elementary school,

1026
01:13:47,714 --> 01:13:52,083
you walked by window every day
on your way to swim practice.

1027
01:13:52,085 --> 01:13:55,553
And in fourth grade,

1028
01:13:55,555 --> 01:13:57,823
you started skateboarding.

1029
01:13:57,825 --> 01:14:03,828
And in sixth grade, you wore a
Ken Griffey Jr. jersey every day

1030
01:14:03,830 --> 01:14:06,233
for, like, a month straight.

1031
01:14:07,735 --> 01:14:11,035
And in ninth grade,

1032
01:14:11,037 --> 01:14:13,739
you buzzed off all your hair.

1033
01:14:13,741 --> 01:14:15,274
Uhh!

1034
01:14:15,276 --> 01:14:16,811
And...

1035
01:14:21,714 --> 01:14:23,584
every day...

1036
01:14:25,853 --> 01:14:28,723
I waited for you
to walk by my window...

1037
01:14:32,026 --> 01:14:34,629
and it was the best part
of my day.

1038
01:14:37,697 --> 01:14:39,601
If I had just looked up...

1039
01:14:42,201 --> 01:14:44,204
I could've been with you
this whole time.

1040
01:14:47,908 --> 01:14:49,043
You were.

1041
01:14:56,750 --> 01:14:57,886
I...

1042
01:14:59,253 --> 01:15:01,054
I love you, Charlie.

1043
01:15:05,224 --> 01:15:06,894
I love you too.

1044
01:15:10,863 --> 01:15:13,731
I can't believe you still
like me after that buzz cut.

1045
01:15:15,335 --> 01:15:17,973
It was so ugly.
Oh, my God.

1046
01:15:49,702 --> 01:15:51,971
Okay, there's some more chicken,
but I'm eating the rest of the noodles,

1047
01:15:51,973 --> 01:15:53,905
if no one wants them.

1048
01:15:53,907 --> 01:15:57,009
Okay. I'm gonna go to the marina.
I'll be back in an hour.

1049
01:15:57,011 --> 01:15:59,276
Someday I wanna see this
Beyoncé-worthy yacht you're cleaning.

1050
01:15:59,278 --> 01:16:01,113
Mm, you're gonna
miss your chance.

1051
01:16:01,115 --> 01:16:03,986
Owner's back tomorrow.
It's my last checkup.

1052
01:16:05,219 --> 01:16:07,355
- See you in an hour?
- Okay.

1053
01:16:10,189 --> 01:16:12,991
- I'll walk you out.
- All right. I'll see you.

1054
01:16:12,993 --> 01:16:15,193
<i>One of these days we can</i>

1055
01:16:15,195 --> 01:16:17,031
take her for a sail
around the harbor.

1056
01:16:18,698 --> 01:16:20,367
We can watch the sun set.

1057
01:16:23,004 --> 01:16:24,004
Wait.

1058
01:16:25,673 --> 01:16:28,340
I... I wanna go with him.

1059
01:16:28,342 --> 01:16:30,378
Go where, honey?

1060
01:16:31,378 --> 01:16:32,714
Out.

1061
01:16:33,714 --> 01:16:36,181
Sailing on the boat.

1062
01:16:36,183 --> 01:16:39,053
I wanna go with him
on the boat. Now.

1063
01:16:44,223 --> 01:16:45,457
Honey.

1064
01:16:45,459 --> 01:16:48,129
- It'd be better if you just...
- Please, Dad.

1065
01:16:51,231 --> 01:16:52,867
Let me do this.

1066
01:16:58,738 --> 01:17:00,806
It's okay, Dad.

1067
01:17:00,808 --> 01:17:02,911
I really want to.

1068
01:17:13,152 --> 01:17:14,852
Okay.

1069
01:18:41,975 --> 01:18:46,845
I've waited my whole life to feel this.

1070
01:21:17,229 --> 01:21:19,966
There he is.

1071
01:21:19,968 --> 01:21:22,100
Hey, Mr. Price.

1072
01:21:22,102 --> 01:21:24,202
Glad you made it by
before you took off.

1073
01:21:24,204 --> 01:21:26,637
Of course. I'm...
I'm actually leaving today.

1074
01:21:26,639 --> 01:21:28,172
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1075
01:21:28,174 --> 01:21:30,408
The first practice is
in a couple of days, so...

1076
01:21:30,410 --> 01:21:32,644
- That's exciting!
- Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

1077
01:21:32,646 --> 01:21:35,547
Your coach sent me your schedule, so
I'm hoping to make it down for a meet.

1078
01:21:35,549 --> 01:21:38,419
But why would, uh, my coach
send you the schedule?

1079
01:21:40,187 --> 01:21:42,721
We stayed in touch, I guess,
uh, after Katie reached out.

1080
01:21:42,723 --> 01:21:45,457
- Katie reached out.
- Yeah.

1081
01:21:45,459 --> 01:21:49,296
She called him. Told him that he
needed to take another look at you.

1082
01:21:50,464 --> 01:21:52,529
Uh, no, Katie never told me.

1083
01:21:52,531 --> 01:21:54,498
You know what? Hold that
thought, all right?

1084
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:56,336
I got something for you.

1085
01:22:09,316 --> 01:22:10,718
She wanted you to have that.

1086
01:22:24,563 --> 01:22:25,968
I, uh...

1087
01:22:27,601 --> 01:22:30,204
I never said sorry.

1088
01:22:31,405 --> 01:22:35,039
I never apologized to you.

1089
01:22:35,041 --> 01:22:37,475
I should have never kept Katie
out that late and I...

1090
01:22:37,477 --> 01:22:38,980
Stop.

1091
01:22:40,112 --> 01:22:41,481
Stop!

1092
01:22:42,749 --> 01:22:45,353
It's nobody's fault.
Okay?

1093
01:22:48,321 --> 01:22:51,789
We knew from the
time that she was little

1094
01:22:51,791 --> 01:22:53,760
that every day
was gonna be a gift.

1095
01:22:55,528 --> 01:22:57,162
I should be thanking you.

1096
01:22:59,566 --> 01:23:01,769
All I ever wanted to do
was make her happy.

1097
01:23:03,603 --> 01:23:05,506
And you made her so happy.

1098
01:23:07,441 --> 01:23:08,441
Thank you.

1099
01:23:14,714 --> 01:23:17,385
- Good luck at school, son.

<i>Coming up next, we have
a song that is blowing up on YouTube</i>

1101
01:23:30,229 --> 01:23:32,497
<i>with over two million views
in just two weeks.</i>

1102
01:23:32,499 --> 01:23:34,498
<i>Get ready to hear it
all over the airwaves.</i>

1103
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:36,333
<i>Just remember
you heard it here first.</i>

1104
01:23:36,335 --> 01:23:39,169
<i>This is "Charlie's Song"
by Katie Price.</i>

1105
01:24:56,616 --> 01:25:00,318
Yes!

1106
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:03,721
Yes! Hey!

1107
01:25:03,723 --> 01:25:06,824
Hey, that's my girl! Hey, that's my girl!

1108
01:25:06,826 --> 01:25:09,627
Did you hear this? Put down the...
Put it down! Listen! Listen!

1109
01:25:19,940 --> 01:25:22,273
<i>Dear, Charlie.</i>

1110
01:25:22,275 --> 01:25:28,212
<i>I've always been more comfortable writing
song lyrics than actual sentences.</i>

1111
01:25:28,214 --> 01:25:30,950
<i>There's no way I can articulate
what you've meant to me.</i>

1112
01:25:30,952 --> 01:25:33,818
<i>Since that moment
we first saw each other,</i>

1113
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:38,855
<i>or the joy you've brought me since
I first saw you outside my window.</i>

1114
01:25:38,857 --> 01:25:41,626
<i>Even though our time together
was short,</i>

1115
01:25:41,628 --> 01:25:45,329
<i>the stars have been burning
for every moment of it.</i>

1116
01:25:45,331 --> 01:25:48,766
<i>And the light from those moments will be
shining down for the next thousand years.</i>

1117
01:25:52,907 --> 01:25:58,575
<i>I hope that somehow I'll be able
to look down and see you, Charlie,</i>

1118
01:25:58,577 --> 01:26:03,248
<i>and all of the incredible moments
just waiting for you out there.</i>

1119
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:04,815
<i>And if you need me,</i>

1120
01:26:04,817 --> 01:26:07,651
<i>all you have to do is look up.</i>

1121
01:26:07,653 --> 01:26:09,686
<i>And remember...</i>

1122
01:26:09,688 --> 01:26:11,256
<i>I love you.</i>
