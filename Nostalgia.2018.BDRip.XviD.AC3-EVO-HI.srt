00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:22,690
I don't think any specific thing
has a particular meaning,

162
00:12:22,692 --> 00:12:24,394
an individual meaning.

163
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:33,734
But it doesn't mean
it's not related.

164
00:12:33,736 --> 00:12:36,003
You know? Just...

165
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,107
It's some, um...

167
00:12:41,077 --> 00:12:42,279
You know?

168
00:12:44,246 --> 00:12:46,613
Maybe that's, um,

169
00:12:46,615 --> 00:12:50,520
one of the advantages
of living a long life...

170
00:12:52,621 --> 00:12:57,391
is you outgrow the tendency
to assign emotional meaning

171
00:12:57,393 --> 00:12:59,029
to a piece of paper.

172
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,271
Well, we should
all be so lucky.

173
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,541
You don't have
to outgrow.

174
00:13:15,644 --> 00:13:17,710
Me, I'm hardly the person
to tell people

175
00:13:17,712 --> 00:13:21,181
that it's wise to accumulate
more things in their homes,

176
00:13:21,183 --> 00:13:26,420
but you should remain open to the
possibility that something...

00:13:26,422 --> 00:13:28,122
it could be anything...

You know...

208
00:17:29,531 --> 00:17:32,302
I used to be
very sloppy about...

209
00:17:33,569 --> 00:17:36,969
changing the batteries
on the fire alarms.

210
00:17:36,971 --> 00:17:39,805
Ned was always the one
that did it.

211
00:17:39,807 --> 00:17:42,275
I would wait until I heard
the beeping and then say,

212
00:17:42,277 --> 00:17:45,579
"Oh, the batteries
ought to be changed."

213
00:17:45,581 --> 00:17:49,448
But he did it
before they started beeping.

214
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:53,986
Every 90 days,
like it says on the package.

215
00:17:53,988 --> 00:17:57,427
But I'm better now.
I've had to learn how to do it.

216
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,961
So, the fire department
still doesn't know

217
00:18:00,963 --> 00:18:03,629
if it was just, like,
a spark that went wrong

218
00:18:03,631 --> 00:18:06,632
or, you know,

219

00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,642
You probably know
all this already.

Well, the details,
they're helpful.

00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,546
Okay.

224
00:18:20,548 --> 00:18:23,750
Do you know why the fire
department was so delayed?

225
00:18:23,752 --> 00:18:26,586
Something about
an electrical malfunction.

226
00:18:26,588 --> 00:18:30,090
Oh. They were called,
like, 20 minutes

227
00:18:30,092 --> 00:18:33,859
before the O'Bryans
came home, 11:00 p.m.

228
00:18:33,861 --> 00:18:36,032
Response time is supposed to be...
Oh, I don't know.

229
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:39,002
I understand.

230
00:18:42,571 --> 00:18:46,042
When the wind took
the fire to the O'Bryans...

231
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,978
that was when I had this moment.

00:18:52,014 --> 00:18:54,917
You know, just an awful feeling.

233
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,023
I knew...

234
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:06,659
I need to go inside
and do that thing

235
00:19:06,661 --> 00:19:09,765
that people wonder about
their whole life.

from a burning building.

I mean, it's easier when it's
just a hypothetical question...

238
00:19:23,812 --> 00:19:26,646
instead of when you see the...

screaming.

but a lot of good that did.

They were the ones
that came in after me.

246
00:19:54,509 --> 00:19:58,080
I got, like, one minute
in my house...

247
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,580
before they came
and took me out.

[EXHALES]

Well, the rings and broaches
belonged to my great-grandmother.

the first things I pictured.

wasn't even a conscious decision.

254

and already I can hear
the police calling my name.

They're inside, downstairs.

it have been smart

for me to take
this whole chest?

[LAUGHING] Oh, God. I don't know.
I can't tell you why.

259
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,602
I knew that if I was gonna take
anything else, it had to be now.

260
00:20:56,604 --> 00:20:59,505
From this room,
our bedroom.

261
00:20:59,507 --> 00:21:03,209
And that's when I...
[CHUCKLES]

262
00:21:03,211 --> 00:21:05,147
saw this on the mantel.

263
00:21:07,716 --> 00:21:10,486
It was Ned's baseball.

264
00:21:11,887 --> 00:21:14,553
He wasn't a player
or anything.

265
00:21:14,555 --> 00:21:16,892
It just was
family history.

266
00:21:18,025 --> 00:21:19,993
The ball.

If you asked me now who won what
game with it, I couldn't tell you.

00:21:29,838 --> 00:21:33,776
It was just "the ball."

that Henry, my son,

to go over the estate, you know.

He said, "What about
the ball?" [CHUCKLES]

It was his birthright,
as far as he was concerned.

"Well, he could have it,"

but I just needed to keep
on looking at it for a while.

I wasn't ready
to not see it there.

It's been in some prominent place
in every home we've ever had.

I told Henry when I moved,
it would be his.

289
00:22:44,912 --> 00:22:49,518
'Cause I knew that this house,
eventually, would be too much for me.

290
00:22:51,786 --> 00:22:55,024
I just didn't know that there
wasn't gonna be an "eventually."

[EXHALES]

292
00:23:00,595 --> 00:23:02,896

Well, we were very lucky

322

because Riley had
a safe in his office.

323

And not a small one either.
It was about this big.

Things over a hundred years old.

We put them all in there.
Thank God.

Kind of frivolous,

330

I always dreamt of having
a nice study with a safe.

331
00:25:28,176 --> 00:25:31,043
Well, when I got the study,
they bought me the safe.

332

entertaining.
