1
00:00:04,909 --> 00:00:06,743
Man:
Children were molested here!

2
00:00:06,743 --> 00:00:11,159
And it's directly connected
to the football program.

3
00:00:11,159 --> 00:00:14,034
Man 2:
Joe Paterno did know
that Sandusky

4
00:00:14,034 --> 00:00:16,243
- was abusing boys
in the shower.
- No, he did not!

5
00:00:16,243 --> 00:00:18,076
Man 3:
I firmly believe,
in his mind,

6
00:00:18,076 --> 00:00:19,909
he did what
he thought was right.

7
00:00:19,909 --> 00:00:21,410
Man 4:
I think Joe Paterno's
getting thrown

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,034
under the bus here
a little bit.

9
00:00:23,034 --> 00:00:24,577
Man 5: He is not
the Attorney General,

10
00:00:24,577 --> 00:00:25,993
he's the football coach.

11
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:27,743
Man 7:
He was the Godfather!

12
00:00:27,743 --> 00:00:32,368
He was aware of what happened,
and allowed it to happen.

13
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:36,118
Woman:
Joe! Where are you going?

14
00:00:36,118 --> 00:00:37,785
I'm going to the john.

15
00:00:37,785 --> 00:00:39,243
It's back here.

16
00:00:39,243 --> 00:00:41,785
It's right across the hall
from where we just were.

17
00:00:41,785 --> 00:00:43,493
Come on!

18
00:00:43,493 --> 00:00:45,493
Oh, yeah.

19
00:00:45,493 --> 00:00:47,159
I got turned around.

20
00:00:48,951 --> 00:00:51,118
Yeah, it's just
right over here
across the hall.

21
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,285
( machine buzzing )

22
00:01:06,993 --> 00:01:08,785
( clank )

23
00:01:33,951 --> 00:01:35,951
( muffled cheering )
Penn State!

24
00:01:37,535 --> 00:01:39,326
Penn State!

25
00:01:52,451 --> 00:01:55,201
- ( crowd cheering )
- ( air horns blows )

26
00:01:55,201 --> 00:01:57,993
( marching band playing )

27
00:02:00,951 --> 00:02:04,076
Announcer: Eight inches
of winter's wrath expected,

28
00:02:04,076 --> 00:02:07,993
as Joe Paterno
seeks win number 409

29
00:02:07,993 --> 00:02:11,076
to surpass all
Division I football coaches.

30
00:02:11,076 --> 00:02:13,743
- Man: Take one.
- Man 2: Give me the stats
on Bolden and McGloin.

31
00:02:13,743 --> 00:02:15,034
Go to mascot.

32
00:02:17,743 --> 00:02:20,702
( cheering, chanting )

33
00:02:20,702 --> 00:02:22,660
Commentator: Joe Paterno
up in the booth again today.

34
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,368
That is certainly not
his preference.

35
00:02:24,368 --> 00:02:25,909
Announcer: Joe is coaching
from the press box today

36
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:27,535
due to a hip injury sustained

37
00:02:27,535 --> 00:02:29,243
in practice
a couple weeks back.

38
00:02:35,201 --> 00:02:37,702
( camera shutter clicks )
- Paterno: Guido.

39
00:02:37,702 --> 00:02:39,660
- Mm-hmm?
- What's that?

40
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,493
Bobby, no shots of Joe
in the booth.

41
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:43,285
Man:
Look, look. Kay?

42
00:02:43,285 --> 00:02:45,827
- Busted.
- N-Number 31, please.

43
00:02:45,827 --> 00:02:48,243
- Give me the camera.
- Nope, nope. I'm deleting.

44
00:02:48,243 --> 00:02:49,785
Security:
No pictures of JoePa.

45
00:02:49,785 --> 00:02:51,368
Announcer:
As college football seems

46
00:02:51,368 --> 00:02:53,034
to change more rapidly
than ever,

47
00:02:53,034 --> 00:02:55,076
he remains the constant.

48
00:02:55,076 --> 00:02:56,618
JoePa. Penn state.

49
00:02:56,618 --> 00:02:59,785
At age 84, he is not
just still in the game,

50
00:02:59,785 --> 00:03:01,909
in many ways, he  is  the game.

51
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:06,034
And with one more win,
another milestone.

52
00:03:06,034 --> 00:03:07,827
And there's the kick!

53
00:03:07,827 --> 00:03:08,993
Penn state offense
will take over

54
00:03:08,993 --> 00:03:11,660
on its own 35-yard line.

55
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,243
Ready in blue?

56
00:03:13,243 --> 00:03:15,076
McGloin out of the shotgun,
heaving long...

57
00:03:16,743 --> 00:03:18,368
Commentator:
We asked Joe Paterno,

58
00:03:18,368 --> 00:03:19,410
"How do you get that message

59
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,410
down to the sideline?"

60
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,410
He writes it down,

61
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,451
"If I call 41 power,

62
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:23,868
I better see 41 power."

63
00:03:23,868 --> 00:03:26,076
All right. Split left,
drag 46 strong.

64
00:03:26,076 --> 00:03:28,702
Watch if they sub.
Check their angle
if they do.

65
00:03:28,702 --> 00:03:30,159
Catch 'em by surprise.

66
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,326
Announcer:
And the snow continues to fall.

67
00:03:32,326 --> 00:03:35,451
Redd takes it on second down...

68
00:03:35,451 --> 00:03:37,951
and they get another Penn State
first down at the 25.

69
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:41,451
Reporter: Here at Penn State,
we've still got 0-0,

70
00:03:41,451 --> 00:03:44,285
but the crowd could not
be more electric.

71
00:03:44,285 --> 00:03:46,743
Everybody here is wondering
if JoePa can deliver

72
00:03:46,743 --> 00:03:50,410
an historic 409th win
for the Nittany Lions.

73
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,868
Announcer:
And the tailback---

74
00:03:51,868 --> 00:03:54,577
Bolden fumbles!
Illinois has got it.

75
00:03:54,577 --> 00:03:58,243
- Shit.
- A straight fumble
by the sophomore...

76
00:03:58,243 --> 00:04:00,410
Let's go, defense!

77
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,743
Get that motherfucker
out of this game right now!

78
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:04,868
Who the fuck was that?

79
00:04:04,868 --> 00:04:06,201
They want Bolden
out of the game.

80
00:04:06,201 --> 00:04:08,410
- You want him out?
- No.

81
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,076
Keep him in.

82
00:04:10,076 --> 00:04:11,993
Give me a shot of Bolden
on the sidelines.

83
00:04:15,368 --> 00:04:16,909
Announcer:
End of the first half,

84
00:04:16,909 --> 00:04:18,660
exactly where we started:

85
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,660
Zero-zero.

86
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,993
Stupid mother--

87
00:04:23,618 --> 00:04:24,827
- You goin' down?
- No.

88
00:04:24,827 --> 00:04:27,660
By the time I get
down with this gimp,

89
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,993
halftime will be over.

90
00:04:31,285 --> 00:04:33,201
Coach is stayin' up here.

91
00:04:33,201 --> 00:04:35,326
Jay's comin' down.

92
00:04:35,326 --> 00:04:37,493
( band playing )

93
00:04:37,493 --> 00:04:39,660
Woman: Jay Is on the move--
without his dad.

94
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,410
Man:
Jay in the locker room?

95
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,660
That's insane.

96
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,493
- They hate him.
- The team?

97
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:45,993
Yeah,
he's a total doorknob.

98
00:04:45,993 --> 00:04:48,034
Why do you think
Joe won't retire?

99
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:49,660
Oh, what? Like if they
wait long enough,

100
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,785
he'll turn
into head coach material?

101
00:04:51,785 --> 00:04:55,243
You motherfuckers!
Hey, hey, listen to me!

102
00:04:55,243 --> 00:04:57,577
You think you can get
on the headset and talk
to me like that?!

103
00:04:57,577 --> 00:04:59,243
What are you guys,
a bunch of fucking--

104
00:04:59,243 --> 00:05:02,076
( yelling )

105
00:05:04,201 --> 00:05:05,618
Back off!

106
00:05:05,618 --> 00:05:07,535
You were out there!
Show some respect!

107
00:05:07,535 --> 00:05:10,201
- Come on.
- Give me a break!

108
00:05:10,201 --> 00:05:12,577
Honey, you remember
Jerry Sandusky and Dottie.

109
00:05:12,577 --> 00:05:14,243
Good to see you.
How ya doin'?

110
00:05:14,243 --> 00:05:15,909
They need you back
on that line, Jerry.

111
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:17,909
- We miss you.
- They're doin' okay.

112
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:27,410
You still think
he's a pedophile?

113
00:05:28,827 --> 00:05:30,410
You know, nobody read
your article.

114
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,410
Fuck you.

115
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,909
It's been six months.

116
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:35,743
That popcorn kernel didn't pop.

117
00:05:35,743 --> 00:05:36,618
Time to move on.

118
00:05:38,118 --> 00:05:39,535
That's just my opinion.

119
00:05:39,535 --> 00:05:42,743
Well, nobody's asking
for your opinion.

120
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:44,909
We got a heads-up
from the attorney general's
office.

121
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:47,243
They're charging Jerry
in the next few weeks.

122
00:05:47,243 --> 00:05:48,493
What, the business
with the shower?

123
00:05:48,493 --> 00:05:50,577
They have more
than one incident.

124
00:05:50,577 --> 00:05:51,909
What, with the same kid?

125
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:53,410
Multiple incidents
with the same kid,

126
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:54,368
and multiple kids.

127
00:05:54,368 --> 00:05:55,368
( sighs )
Oh, Jesus.

128
00:05:55,368 --> 00:05:56,743
All in our locker room?

129
00:05:56,743 --> 00:06:00,868
I don't know.
Look, evidently...

130
00:06:00,868 --> 00:06:04,034
you two might be named
in the indictment.

131
00:06:04,034 --> 00:06:05,410
What the fuck
you talkin' about?

132
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,201
Cynthia says
they've got no case.

133
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:09,493
She's gonna
get it thrown out.

134
00:06:09,493 --> 00:06:11,076
We just need
to ride it out.

135
00:06:11,076 --> 00:06:12,951
That's easy
for you to say,
Graham.

136
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:14,993
I am in this
a hundred percent
with you.

137
00:06:14,993 --> 00:06:19,034
Oh, we're-- we're indicted
alongside an accused pedophile

138
00:06:19,034 --> 00:06:20,451
and you're say-- Ohh.

139
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:23,785
Wow, I just hit
the motherlode.

140
00:06:23,785 --> 00:06:25,285
You're not
taking a fall, Gary.

141
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:27,660
I will make sure
that doesn't happen.

142
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,076
Hey, guys.
Can I get a quick hit?

143
00:06:29,076 --> 00:06:30,368
Of course.

144
00:06:30,368 --> 00:06:31,951
Ready one, take one.

145
00:06:31,951 --> 00:06:33,451
Reporter: I'm here
with Penn State University

146
00:06:33,451 --> 00:06:35,243
president Graham Spanier,

147
00:06:35,243 --> 00:06:37,951
vice president
of the university Gary Schultz,

148
00:06:37,951 --> 00:06:40,451
and Athletic Director
Tim Curley.

149
00:06:40,451 --> 00:06:44,118
You are looking
at a possible 409 wins

150
00:06:44,118 --> 00:06:46,451
for Penn State's own JoePa.

151
00:06:46,451 --> 00:06:47,827
How does that feel?

152
00:06:47,827 --> 00:06:49,743
Mara, we couldn't
be more excited.

153
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,159
Ready one, take one!

154
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,285
TV: If you want to get a sense
of how respected,

155
00:06:54,285 --> 00:06:57,951
how revered, Joe Paterno is
here at Penn State,

156
00:06:57,951 --> 00:07:00,868
look at this:
a monument they built to him

157
00:07:00,868 --> 00:07:03,034
calling him a coach,
an educator,

158
00:07:03,034 --> 00:07:04,993
and a humanitarian.

159
00:07:07,451 --> 00:07:09,285
- We are!
- Penn State!

160
00:07:09,285 --> 00:07:10,451
- We are!

164
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:19,326
Quarterback:

00:07:23,201 --> 00:07:25,535
- 3:32 to go in the third.
- Aw, shit.

168
00:07:25,535 --> 00:07:28,743
It's Illinois
who strikes first.

169
00:07:28,743 --> 00:07:31,451
- Paterno on two. Standby, two.
- Tighter on Paterno.

170
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,410
Slow push him, slow push him.
Ready, two? Take two.

171
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,368
Announcer:
Third and goal.

172
00:07:35,368 --> 00:07:37,285
McGloin fumbles the football,

173
00:07:37,285 --> 00:07:40,201
picks it up again,
sacked at the 15.

174
00:07:40,201 --> 00:07:44,034
That is the sixth fumble
of the day by Penn State.

175
00:07:44,034 --> 00:07:46,285
Fourth and goal,
the kicking unit comes out.

176
00:07:46,285 --> 00:07:48,201
Fera's 30-yarder

177
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,368
is...good!

178
00:07:50,368 --> 00:07:52,243
Penn State's on the board.

179
00:07:52,243 --> 00:07:53,868
It's seven-three.

180
00:07:53,868 --> 00:07:55,451
...on four.

181
00:07:55,451 --> 00:07:57,743
Scheelhaase is gonna run again
on third and twelve.

182
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:59,868
This time Penn State's ready

183
00:07:59,868 --> 00:08:03,326
to force fourth down
for Illinois.

184
00:08:03,326 --> 00:08:04,535
Man:
Take one.

185
00:08:04,535 --> 00:08:06,285
Announcer:
3:05 to go.

186
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,577
80 yards for
the Penn State offense.

187
00:08:08,577 --> 00:08:10,410
Nittany Lions need a touchdown.

188
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,577
What's the story
with Moye?

189
00:08:12,577 --> 00:08:14,243
Fractured
metatarsal.

190
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:16,577
Doctor says he can go
if it's an emergency.

191
00:08:16,577 --> 00:08:18,743
Well, this looks
like an emergency.

192
00:08:20,118 --> 00:08:21,076
You got Moye?

193
00:08:21,076 --> 00:08:23,076
Moye! Moye! Get Moye!

194
00:08:23,076 --> 00:08:26,243
Moye, let's go!
Come on, come on,
let's go.

195
00:08:26,243 --> 00:08:28,951
The team needs you.
Joe needs you. Go! Go!

196
00:08:28,951 --> 00:08:31,243
Announcer:
And McGloin,

197
00:08:31,243 --> 00:08:32,743
the junior quarterback
from Scranton.

198
00:08:32,743 --> 00:08:35,451
McGloin throws,
it's completed!

199
00:08:35,451 --> 00:08:38,285
And who makes the grab
but Derek Moye,

200
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:41,076
coming back from a broken bone
in his left foot.

201
00:08:41,076 --> 00:08:43,909
Jay: Now we're in business.
They're gonna crowd the line,

202
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:45,535
think we're gonna run--
let's go to Brown.

203
00:08:46,618 --> 00:08:47,785
Man: Take one.

204
00:08:47,785 --> 00:08:49,243
Ready, two...

205
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,743
Announcer:
Right back to Justin Brown!

206
00:08:52,743 --> 00:08:55,285
First down, Penn State driving.

207
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,785
All right,
we got a game here, folks.

208
00:08:56,785 --> 00:08:58,868
Everybody stay focused.
Let's do our jobs.

209
00:08:58,868 --> 00:09:00,243
- Fourth down and sixth.
- Let's go!

210
00:09:00,243 --> 00:09:02,201
Penn State needs to convert.

211
00:09:02,201 --> 00:09:05,285
McGloin heaves it
to the end zone for Moye--

212
00:09:05,285 --> 00:09:06,951
It is...

213
00:09:06,951 --> 00:09:11,785
incomplete! But there are
multiple flags on the play.

214
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:13,285
Penn State's gonna
get another shot.

215
00:09:13,285 --> 00:09:14,743
- ( chatter )
- Man: Nice.

216
00:09:14,743 --> 00:09:17,493
- Time out, time out.
- Time out. Time out.

217
00:09:17,493 --> 00:09:20,118
- Time out. Time out.
- ( blows whistle )

218
00:09:20,118 --> 00:09:22,118
Man: All right, Coach.
What do you want to do?

219
00:09:23,827 --> 00:09:25,743
Heavy right,
25 counter.

220
00:09:25,743 --> 00:09:27,868
That's good.
Heavy right,
25 counter.

221
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:30,618
- Come on, baby.
- Heavy right, 25 counter.

222
00:09:30,618 --> 00:09:33,577
All right. Heavy right,
25 counter. Let's go.

223
00:09:33,577 --> 00:09:35,785
Announcer: A minute-20 to go
in the fourth quarter,

224
00:09:35,785 --> 00:09:37,785
down by four,
Penn State needs

225
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,993
to get into the end zone
for the first time today.

226
00:09:41,368 --> 00:09:43,951
McGloin handing off, Silas...

227
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:45,410
He's in the end zone!

228
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,577
Touchdown, Penn State!

229
00:09:47,577 --> 00:09:49,451
With a minute-eight to go,

230
00:09:49,451 --> 00:09:51,868
the Nittany Lions
are into the end zone,

231
00:09:51,868 --> 00:09:54,827
- an 80-yard touchdown drive.
- Yes! Yes!

232
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:57,159
Penn State hoping
to close it out

233
00:09:57,159 --> 00:10:01,159
and give Joe Paterno
win number 409,

234
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:02,577
making him the winningest coach

235
00:10:02,577 --> 00:10:04,159
in the history
of Division I football.

236
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,535
Five seconds.
42-yarder to tie it.

237
00:10:16,827 --> 00:10:18,535
( crowd roars )

238
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:21,159
Announcer:
No good! Penn State wins!

239
00:10:22,368 --> 00:10:24,535
10-7.

240
00:10:24,535 --> 00:10:28,076
Win 409 for Joe Paterno

241
00:10:28,076 --> 00:10:29,909
as head coach at Penn State....

242
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:32,535
( broadcast fades out )

243
00:10:32,535 --> 00:10:35,368
( machine buzzing )

244
00:10:45,493 --> 00:10:49,034

245
00:10:50,868 --> 00:10:53,535
- ( phone rings )
- Sara Ganim.

246
00:11:05,034 --> 00:11:07,702
Holy fucking shit.

247
00:11:07,702 --> 00:11:10,076
Ganim: Criminal charges,
Gerald Sandusky.

248
00:11:10,076 --> 00:11:11,493
40 counts.

249
00:11:11,493 --> 00:11:14,159

251
00:11:16,034 --> 00:11:17,577

- Person less than 13  years.

254
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:23,159
Jesus Chri--

255
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:24,285
What the fuck.

256
00:11:24,285 --> 00:11:26,076
W-W-Where'd it go?

257
00:11:26,076 --> 00:11:27,702
- Reload. Reload--
- I'm reloading.

258
00:11:27,702 --> 00:11:29,243
- Is it the computer?
- I don't know.

259
00:11:29,243 --> 00:11:30,201
Give me a second.

260
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,868
Every other site's working.

261
00:11:34,618 --> 00:11:35,868
They pulled it.

262
00:11:35,868 --> 00:11:37,868
( sighs )

263
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,243
( phone line out ringing )

264
00:11:44,243 --> 00:11:45,285
Boy (over phone): Mike.

265
00:11:45,285 --> 00:11:46,951
Man:
Hey, man, are you home?

266
00:11:46,951 --> 00:11:48,493
- No, I'm on my way.
- Are you driving?

267
00:11:48,493 --> 00:11:50,451
She told me
I could take the car.

268
00:11:50,451 --> 00:11:52,118
- I didn't--
-  No, it's fine. Listen,

269
00:11:52,118 --> 00:11:53,577
I need you
to pull over for a second.

270
00:11:53,577 --> 00:11:55,159
Can you do that?

271
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,451
( exhales )

272
00:12:03,493 --> 00:12:06,951
Man ( over phone ): Okay, look.
The charges against Jerry
went up online.

273
00:12:06,951 --> 00:12:08,827
They disappeared
like a minute later,

274
00:12:08,827 --> 00:12:10,785
which means
somebody probably
posted them by mistake,

275
00:12:10,785 --> 00:12:12,451
but a lot of people saw it,
so...

276
00:12:12,451 --> 00:12:15,076
It's happening now.
They're gonna arrest him.

277
00:12:15,076 --> 00:12:17,743
Probably tomorrow morning,
Sunday at the latest,

278
00:12:17,743 --> 00:12:20,618
and they're gonna have to post
the grand jury presentment

279
00:12:20,618 --> 00:12:22,243
when they're ready
to bring him in,

280
00:12:22,243 --> 00:12:24,660
so the whole story's
gonna be there.

281
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,993
It's public.

282
00:12:26,993 --> 00:12:28,827
And I won't say your name.

283
00:12:28,827 --> 00:12:30,951
May use your initials, but...

284
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:33,201
it's happening.

285
00:12:33,201 --> 00:12:36,285
- ( boy sniffles, sighs )
- Aaron?

286
00:12:37,368 --> 00:12:39,785
( humorless chuckle )

287
00:12:39,785 --> 00:12:40,993
Aaron?

288
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:43,159
( sniffles, exhales )

289
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:46,285
Hey, buddy. Hey.

290
00:12:52,577 --> 00:12:55,368
( operatic singing )

291
00:12:55,368 --> 00:12:56,368
Woman: Hey, Joe.

292
00:12:56,368 --> 00:12:57,326
Paterno: Yeah.

293
00:12:57,326 --> 00:12:58,618
You wanna have dinner

294
00:12:58,618 --> 00:12:59,827
with Don and Shirley
on Sunday night?

295
00:12:59,827 --> 00:13:01,618
No.

296
00:13:01,618 --> 00:13:03,326
Come on, they want
to celebrate the win.

297
00:13:03,326 --> 00:13:05,951
Well, let 'em go celebrate
by themselves.

298
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,868
- ( scoffs ) So, no?
- Well, I...

299
00:13:08,868 --> 00:13:11,535
All right, let's see
how it plays out on Sunday.

300
00:13:11,535 --> 00:13:13,535
Well, I've got
a board meeting
in Philly.

301
00:13:13,535 --> 00:13:16,535
Maybe after a day by himself,
he'll want to be, you know--

302
00:13:16,535 --> 00:13:19,827
You asked me a question.
Don't ignore the answer.

303
00:13:19,827 --> 00:13:21,159
Oh, hang on one second, Sheryl.

304
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:22,410
I got Scotty on the other line.

305
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,243
Hey, Scotty.
I'm on the phone.

306
00:13:24,243 --> 00:13:27,368
- Scotty: Ma, I need
to talk to Dad.
- Okay.

307
00:13:27,368 --> 00:13:29,909
Uh, Joe, call Scotty
when I'm off.

308
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,368
I'll call him when I finish
the practice script.

309
00:13:32,368 --> 00:13:34,785
Scotty,
he's gonna call you back
when he's finished

310
00:13:34,785 --> 00:13:36,159
with the practice scripts,
okay?

311
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:38,076
No, no, no, no!
Ma, I gotta ta--

312
00:13:38,076 --> 00:13:41,702
- ( disconnects )
- Yeah, Sheryl.
Special Olympics...

313
00:13:41,702 --> 00:13:43,118
Oh, no, it's a 5K.

314
00:13:43,118 --> 00:13:46,868
( grunts )
You gotta be kiddin' me.

315
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:49,285
( starts car,
revs engine )

316
00:13:55,076 --> 00:13:56,410
Gamin:
We saw the charges,

317
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,577
but was that one victim
or two victims?

318
00:13:58,577 --> 00:14:00,159
Okay, just tell me this:

319
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,577
when's the guy
gonna get arrested?

320
00:14:01,577 --> 00:14:03,410
Isn't he considered
a flight risk?

321
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:06,243
John says there may be
somebody else named
in the indictment.

322
00:14:06,243 --> 00:14:09,535
Jessie-- Jessie, is someone
other than Jerry Sandusky

323
00:14:09,535 --> 00:14:12,243
named in the indictment?
Jessie?

324
00:14:12,243 --> 00:14:14,660
Hey, it's Charlie Thompson
at The Patriot-News, for Bill.

325
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,326
No, I can wait.

326
00:14:16,326 --> 00:14:17,743
Newhouse: Somebody needs
to call Graham Spanier!

327
00:14:17,743 --> 00:14:19,118
I'll do it.

328
00:14:19,118 --> 00:14:20,285
What'd he say about
your first article?

329
00:14:20,285 --> 00:14:21,909
Nothing.
Him and everybody else.

330
00:14:21,909 --> 00:14:23,909
Six months went by.
It was like I wrote
about a yard sale.

331
00:14:23,909 --> 00:14:25,868
Ask Spanier
if he thinks he's
gonna get fired.

332
00:14:25,868 --> 00:14:28,243
They're not gonna fire
the president of Penn State.

333
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:30,743
Jerry hasn't worked there
in a decade.

334
00:14:30,743 --> 00:14:33,118
Thompson:
Bill, when are we gonna see
this grand jury presentment?

335
00:14:33,118 --> 00:14:35,743
You're either
charging the guy
or you're not.

336
00:14:35,743 --> 00:14:37,159
Newhouse: Sara...

337
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:39,118
it's up.

338
00:14:44,243 --> 00:14:45,993
( typing )

339
00:14:56,618 --> 00:14:58,285
Woman: Aaron...

340
00:14:58,285 --> 00:15:00,118
I don't want you to read it.

341
00:15:00,118 --> 00:15:01,577
Aaron.

342
00:15:01,577 --> 00:15:03,410
Everything's on there.

343
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:04,951
It's not gonna
change anything--

344
00:15:04,951 --> 00:15:08,118
You said I didn't
have to tell you.

345
00:15:08,118 --> 00:15:10,076
With the grand jury
and the cops...

346
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,660
It's on the computer, Aaron.

347
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,785
Your mother can't be
the only person in the country
not to read it.

348
00:15:22,868 --> 00:15:27,993
Newhouse: Looks like Victim One
was 11 when it started.

349
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:32,201
Sandusky performed oral sex
on him more than 20 times.

350
00:15:32,201 --> 00:15:36,993
Sandusky also had Victim One
perform oral sex on him
one time.

351
00:15:36,993 --> 00:15:40,535
Jesus-- uh,
touched Victim One's penis
with his hands.

352
00:15:40,535 --> 00:15:43,201
Victim One did not want
to engage in sexual conduct

353
00:15:43,201 --> 00:15:45,243
with Sandusky,
knew it was wrong.

354
00:15:45,243 --> 00:15:46,868
And Victim Two?

355
00:15:46,868 --> 00:15:50,951
( sighs ) Uh... ten years old.

356
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:53,201
Anal intercourse.

357
00:15:53,201 --> 00:15:55,076
- ( cell phone ringing )
- Shit.

358
00:15:57,827 --> 00:16:00,702
- Hello? Dawn?
- Woman ( over phone): Hi.

359
00:16:02,993 --> 00:16:04,868
Ganim:
I'm gonna be in your area

360
00:16:04,868 --> 00:16:06,201
in a couple hours.

361
00:16:06,201 --> 00:16:07,201
Should I stop by?

362
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,993
( crying )

363
00:16:09,993 --> 00:16:11,785
I don't know.

364
00:16:11,785 --> 00:16:13,410
Okay, well,
how about I head that way,

365
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,034
and then if it doesn't
feel right, you can just--

366
00:16:15,034 --> 00:16:16,951
you can send me back.

367
00:16:16,951 --> 00:16:18,868
( sniffling )

368
00:16:20,702 --> 00:16:22,243
Dawn?

369
00:16:27,201 --> 00:16:28,076
Dawn?

370
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,660
Victim One's mom.

371
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,076
Call me from the car.

372
00:16:37,076 --> 00:16:38,410
We'll finish the piece
while you drive.

373
00:16:40,285 --> 00:16:41,868
Ganim:
The indictment alleges

374
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:43,702
that former Penn State coach
Jerry Sandusky

375
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:47,243
used The Second Mile,
the charity he founded in 1977,

376
00:16:47,243 --> 00:16:49,493
- to get access to
and molest boys...
- Okay.

377
00:16:49,493 --> 00:16:52,577
many of whom were vulnerable
due to their social situations.

378
00:16:52,577 --> 00:16:53,951
Newhouse:
That's great.

379
00:16:53,951 --> 00:16:55,118
Ganim:
Many of the alleged incidents

380
00:16:55,118 --> 00:16:56,743
happened in the Lasch building,

381
00:16:56,743 --> 00:16:58,993
the football building
on Penn State campus.

382
00:16:58,993 --> 00:17:01,909
Man:
With football season
well underway now,

383
00:17:01,909 --> 00:17:04,577
for many fans,
it doesn't get any bigger
than Penn State.

384
00:17:04,577 --> 00:17:08,909
But the case against one of
that team's long-time coaches
is unfolding, and quickly.

385
00:17:08,909 --> 00:17:12,493
Charged with abusing
several boys at a program
he'd started,

386
00:17:12,493 --> 00:17:14,951
former coach Jerry Sandusky,
once heir apparent

387
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,618
to the legendary Joe Paterno,

388
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:19,410
is charged with sexually
abusing eight boys.

389
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,660
And now two high-ranking
university officials,

390
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,993
the athletic director
and a vice president,

391
00:17:23,993 --> 00:17:27,159
face charges in court, accused
of looking the other way

392
00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:29,618
after several mothers
came forward.

393
00:17:29,618 --> 00:17:31,410
One mother told reporter
Sara Ganim

394
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,243
she feels betrayed
by Penn State,

395
00:17:33,243 --> 00:17:36,909
as details emerge
of what she sees as a cover-up,

396
00:17:36,909 --> 00:17:39,951
saying one of her sons
complained about Sandusky,

397
00:17:39,951 --> 00:17:41,326
but no one listened.

398
00:17:42,868 --> 00:17:45,577
"Penn State forever,
molder of men"--

399
00:17:45,577 --> 00:17:47,951
well, where
is that integrity now?

400
00:17:47,951 --> 00:17:49,618
Woman:
If these allegations are true,

401
00:17:49,618 --> 00:17:51,076
then this goes to the very top

402
00:17:51,076 --> 00:17:53,118
of the athletic department
at Penn State,

403
00:17:53,118 --> 00:17:55,326
and one would have
to think that there

404
00:17:55,326 --> 00:17:57,618
would have to be
some kind of housecleaning.

405
00:17:58,785 --> 00:18:01,702
( indistinct conversation )

406
00:18:01,702 --> 00:18:05,577
( game playing on TV )

407
00:18:05,577 --> 00:18:08,285
Announcer:
They do go conservative--
is he gonna make it pay off?

408
00:18:08,285 --> 00:18:11,993
I can't-- I can't believe it,
ya know? And then on top of it,

409
00:18:11,993 --> 00:18:14,743
they-- they indicted
Tim and Gary too.

410
00:18:14,743 --> 00:18:16,076
- For what?
- For what.

411
00:18:16,076 --> 00:18:18,368
For perjury, for lying
to the grand jury.

412
00:18:18,368 --> 00:18:20,326
For failing
to protect children.

413
00:18:20,326 --> 00:18:22,702
They testified in front
of the grand jury
just like you did, Dad.

414
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:24,326
Scott:
You read it, right?

415
00:18:24,326 --> 00:18:25,951
You read the grand jury
presentment?

416
00:18:25,951 --> 00:18:29,034
No. They indict me?

417
00:18:30,993 --> 00:18:32,285
No.

418
00:18:32,285 --> 00:18:33,535
So?

419
00:18:33,535 --> 00:18:36,243
Wait, are you--
( scoffs ) Okay.

420
00:18:36,243 --> 00:18:39,285
I am going to print
this thing out
so you will read it.

421
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:43,118
I got Nebraska
a week from today.

422
00:18:43,118 --> 00:18:46,868
They're seven-and-one,
just so you know.

423
00:18:46,868 --> 00:18:49,368
( doorbell rings )

424
00:18:49,368 --> 00:18:50,909
Spanier.

425
00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:53,159
Ohh. Put me
in the ground.

426
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:56,034
Scott: Hey.

427
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:57,909
Hey, Scott.

428
00:18:57,909 --> 00:18:59,451
Got something I want
to run by your dad.

429
00:18:59,451 --> 00:19:01,868
Yeah, come on in.
He's watching Nebraska.

430
00:19:03,493 --> 00:19:04,702
How do they look?

431
00:19:04,702 --> 00:19:05,702
Paterno:
Good is how they look.

432
00:19:07,326 --> 00:19:08,618
Northwestern's up by four,

433
00:19:08,618 --> 00:19:10,577
but they're not
gonna hold it.

434
00:19:10,577 --> 00:19:12,577
( sighs )

435
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,368
All right.

436
00:19:17,368 --> 00:19:20,285
"The allegations
about a former coach
are troubling,

437
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:23,118
and it is appropriate
that they be investigated
thoroughly.

438
00:19:23,118 --> 00:19:25,451
With regard
to the other indictments,

439
00:19:25,451 --> 00:19:27,785
I wish to say that
Tim Curley and Gary Schultz

440
00:19:27,785 --> 00:19:29,827
have my unconditional support.

441
00:19:29,827 --> 00:19:31,577
I have complete confidence
in how they have handled

442
00:19:31,577 --> 00:19:35,410
the allegations
about a former
university employee.

443
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:39,909
I am confident the record
will show that these charges
are groundless,

444
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:43,702
and that they conducted
themselves professionally
and appropriately."

445
00:19:43,702 --> 00:19:47,909
Why do you say that...
about Gary and Tim?

446
00:19:49,243 --> 00:19:50,493
'Cause it's true.

447
00:19:50,493 --> 00:19:52,702
Grand jury doesn't think so.

448
00:19:52,702 --> 00:19:54,410
You think
that's right?

449
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:56,410
Well, what do I know?

450
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:57,660
But I wouldn't go stand

451
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,159
in front of the bull
waving a flag.

452
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:04,660
This school should look
like we give a hoot,
you know?

453
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,368
We want everything
run down

454
00:20:06,368 --> 00:20:08,493
until we know
what actually happened.

455
00:20:08,493 --> 00:20:10,909
That's a huge slap in the face
to Gary and Tim.

456
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:13,577
They were...
protecting the school.

457
00:20:13,577 --> 00:20:14,951
Do what you want.

458
00:20:14,951 --> 00:20:17,493
You're asking me,
I'm sayin'.

459
00:20:17,493 --> 00:20:19,034
I think it's
a stupid thing to say.

460
00:20:19,034 --> 00:20:22,451
Well, I'll look at it again.

461
00:20:24,993 --> 00:20:28,201
OK. You need anything,
give me a call.

462
00:20:28,201 --> 00:20:30,076
( door opens, closes )

463
00:20:30,076 --> 00:20:31,493
Hey.

464
00:20:31,493 --> 00:20:33,577
- Paterno: Yeah?
- Spanier: Hey, Jay.

465
00:20:33,577 --> 00:20:34,993
We're just bending
your dad's ear.

466
00:20:34,993 --> 00:20:37,577
Latet anguis in herba.

467
00:20:37,577 --> 00:20:39,285
What does that mean?

468
00:20:39,285 --> 00:20:41,243
It's Virgil.
It means you're
gonna be fine.

469
00:20:41,243 --> 00:20:44,868
Northwestern's up by four.

470
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,451
- That's not gonna last.
- Yeah.

471
00:20:46,451 --> 00:20:48,326
Thanks for stopping by,
Graham.

472
00:20:48,326 --> 00:20:49,285
Spanier:
See you soon.

473
00:20:51,118 --> 00:20:52,868
Oh boy.

474
00:20:53,993 --> 00:20:55,076
What was that?

475
00:20:55,076 --> 00:20:57,493
Box of rocks.

476
00:20:57,493 --> 00:20:59,493
He wants to be
everybody's friend.

477
00:20:59,493 --> 00:21:01,451
He's gonna
get himself fired. Watch.

478
00:21:01,451 --> 00:21:03,702
Couldn't happen
to a nicer guy.

479
00:21:03,702 --> 00:21:06,909
There's peppers
and provolone on the stove.
Heat it up.

480
00:21:06,909 --> 00:21:10,159
- Yeah, I talked to Guido.
- Yeah.

481
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,743
He thinks
this is gonna be more
than just a sports story.

482
00:21:13,743 --> 00:21:16,034
Scott: You think?
Did you read it?

483
00:21:16,034 --> 00:21:17,660
The presentment? No.
I just got here.

484
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,827
Yeah.
What's the hurry?

485
00:21:18,827 --> 00:21:20,285
The guy only fucked
eight children.

486
00:21:20,285 --> 00:21:22,034
- Whoa, what is with the talk?
- Hey, hey.

487
00:21:22,034 --> 00:21:24,993
Just somebody
other than me has
to read this thing.

488
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:27,743
( Scott, Jay shouting )

489
00:21:27,743 --> 00:21:30,743
Can you take this
someplace else, guys?!

490
00:21:30,743 --> 00:21:34,076
I'm trying to work here.
Anybody care?

491
00:21:34,076 --> 00:21:37,159
You got your own homes now,
ya know.

492
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:40,868
Man: Well, what goes on in
major college sports programs

493
00:21:40,868 --> 00:21:42,618
are they become
little fiefdoms,

494
00:21:42,618 --> 00:21:44,702
and the college coach
becomes all-powerful,

495
00:21:44,702 --> 00:21:47,951
and Joe Paterno is like a god
on that campus.

496
00:21:47,951 --> 00:21:50,785
Man #2:
He's the leader. I understand
there's a university president,

497
00:21:50,785 --> 00:21:54,368
there's a athletic director,
but we know who's running
Penn State.

498
00:21:54,368 --> 00:21:55,535
It's JoePa.

499
00:21:55,535 --> 00:21:57,285
Phone: Mailbox. One.

500
00:21:57,285 --> 00:21:59,493
You have
one new message.

501
00:21:59,493 --> 00:22:03,827
Sara, it's Dawn.
Can we... I'm--I'm sorry.

502
00:22:03,827 --> 00:22:05,743
Let's do this tomorrow.

503
00:22:05,743 --> 00:22:10,951
We're pretty wrung out
over here. Aaron's, um...

504
00:22:10,951 --> 00:22:15,410
Why don't you come by
in the morning. Okay? Thanks.

505
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,410
( "Scarlet Begonias"
by Grateful Dead playing )

506
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:23,909
- Where's Juliet?
- Food?

507
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:25,909
Hey! Did you
just get here?

508
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:26,909
Yeah.

509
00:22:26,909 --> 00:22:29,368
Liam, Mindy. Sara.
She graduated.

510
00:22:29,368 --> 00:22:32,118
- She's gonna
crash here a few nights.
- What up?

511
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:33,410
She's the one that got
Sandusky arrested.

512
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:34,993
You did?

513
00:22:34,993 --> 00:22:36,951
No. No, no.
I-- I didn't.

514
00:22:36,951 --> 00:22:39,201
He's fucking disgusting.
It's sick.

515
00:22:39,201 --> 00:22:43,243
Wait, she's, um,
she's the cub reporter, right?

516
00:22:43,243 --> 00:22:44,785
Does anybody
call you Cubby?

517
00:22:44,785 --> 00:22:47,034
Uh, no.

518
00:22:53,076 --> 00:22:57,451
Man: For 67-year-old
Jerry Sandusky, a jubilant
career at Penn State

519
00:22:57,451 --> 00:23:00,660
has dwindled to a perp walk
and prosecution.

520
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,785
A Penn State graduate
team assistant

521
00:23:02,785 --> 00:23:06,451
allegedly witnessed
a 2002 rape by Sandusky,

522
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:09,410
involving a ten-year-old boy
in a shower

523
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:11,285
at Penn State's football
facility.

524
00:23:11,285 --> 00:23:13,451
The assistant told
Coach Paterno about it,

525
00:23:13,451 --> 00:23:17,285
and Paterno is said to have
told Athletic director
Tim Curley,

526
00:23:17,285 --> 00:23:20,618
and university official
Gary Schultz.

527
00:23:20,618 --> 00:23:21,993
( knocking on door )

528
00:23:25,951 --> 00:23:27,493
Hi, I'm Sara Ganim,

529
00:23:27,493 --> 00:23:29,034
and I work
with the Harrisburg
Patriot-News.

530
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:30,785
I was wondering
if I'd be able to ask--

531
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:33,034
No. I'm not talking
to anybody. Thank you.

532
00:23:33,034 --> 00:23:34,493
You're Gary Schultz' assistant.

533
00:23:34,493 --> 00:23:36,993
- Right?
- Get off the property!

534
00:23:36,993 --> 00:23:39,285
- OK. I just wanted to--
- Get off the property!

535
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:41,618
- Okay, I'm getting off.
- Not fast enough!

536
00:23:41,618 --> 00:23:43,743
OK! Fuck.

537
00:23:43,743 --> 00:23:45,618
- Ganim: Hello?
- Newhouse: Hey. So, uh,

538
00:23:45,618 --> 00:23:47,827
after two days
of complete and utter silence,

539
00:23:47,827 --> 00:23:50,493
the national news finally
noticed we published a story.

540
00:23:50,493 --> 00:23:51,993
You got time to talk to CNN?

541
00:23:51,993 --> 00:23:53,702
Yeah, I just
need a minute.

542
00:23:53,702 --> 00:23:56,201
I've got somebody
who's really... excited.

543
00:23:56,201 --> 00:24:00,243
Man: How dare you
to disturb my wife like that!

544
00:24:00,243 --> 00:24:02,577
Woman:
The Pennsylvania
attorney general

545
00:24:02,577 --> 00:24:04,368
says that coach Paterno

546
00:24:04,368 --> 00:24:07,076
is facing no criminal charges
because he followed the law

547
00:24:07,076 --> 00:24:10,493
by quickly telling what he knew
to his superiors.

548
00:24:10,493 --> 00:24:14,868
What she didn't say was if
he had a moral obligation
to do more.

549
00:24:14,868 --> 00:24:17,243
Scott: Steve Garban's
pretending he's not home.

550
00:24:17,243 --> 00:24:20,868
Mary: No one from the board
of trustees will answer
our call.

551
00:24:20,868 --> 00:24:22,535
Guido:
Mother of Christ.

552
00:24:22,535 --> 00:24:23,702
Put out a damn statement

553
00:24:23,702 --> 00:24:25,368
so we can be through
with this already.

554
00:24:25,368 --> 00:24:26,702
We should have
done it six months ago

555
00:24:26,702 --> 00:24:28,201
when it first
came out in the paper.

556
00:24:28,201 --> 00:24:29,951
People need
to hear from you.

557
00:24:29,951 --> 00:24:32,034
This is not
a smart move, Guido.

558
00:24:32,034 --> 00:24:35,159
- I'm not a judge, but...
- OK.

559
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:37,909
It's-- there's a legal process
happening here.

560
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:40,368
OK. All right.
A legal process
happening here.

561
00:24:40,368 --> 00:24:42,827
- So...
- 'K. Legal process.

562
00:24:43,993 --> 00:24:45,410
( sighs deeply )

563
00:24:50,243 --> 00:24:51,702
Oh, my God...

564
00:24:51,702 --> 00:24:54,326
Oh--
( gagging )

565
00:24:56,076 --> 00:24:56,909
Ma?

566
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,660
Mary:
Mommy?

567
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,577
What's wrong?

568
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:07,410
( retching )

569
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:10,076
- Mary: Mommy?
- It's shocking,
if it's true...

570
00:25:10,076 --> 00:25:12,909
- You OK?
- We're deeply saddened...

571
00:25:12,909 --> 00:25:16,743
When I heard what I heard,
I reported it right way...

572
00:25:16,743 --> 00:25:18,618
- To?
- Uh...

573
00:25:18,618 --> 00:25:19,909
Tim and Gary.

574
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:21,618
He did what he was
supposed to do.

575
00:25:21,618 --> 00:25:23,743
- Right. In 2001.
- What?

576
00:25:23,743 --> 00:25:27,410
2001? Yeah. ( stammers )
I told the Grand Jury.

577
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:30,034
Right, and you should say
what McQueary told you, right?

578
00:25:30,034 --> 00:25:32,909
Guido:
"An assistant coach
informed me that--"

579
00:25:32,909 --> 00:25:36,034
An assistant coach
informed me what?

580
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:39,285
McQueary couldn't put his--
a sentence together.

581
00:25:39,285 --> 00:25:42,243
He couldn't catch his breath.
He was all over the place.

582
00:25:42,243 --> 00:25:46,451
So, he told you
that they were having sex?

583
00:25:46,451 --> 00:25:47,785
No, he didn't--

584
00:25:47,785 --> 00:25:49,827
He didn't know
what he saw. Come on.

585
00:25:49,827 --> 00:25:51,951
They were touching maybe.
Who knows?

586
00:25:51,951 --> 00:25:54,577
All I know is
what he saw upset him.

587
00:25:54,577 --> 00:25:55,868
That's-- That's-- That's--

588
00:25:55,868 --> 00:25:58,951
He -- He was--
He was, uh, rattled.

589
00:25:58,951 --> 00:26:00,577
Ya know? Something happened.

590
00:26:00,577 --> 00:26:03,827
But, so why does
the presentment
say anal rape?

591
00:26:03,827 --> 00:26:06,410
- It says that?
- Guido: Didn't you read it?

592
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:09,118
- It says anal sex.
- Oh, well, you're the lawyer.

593
00:26:09,118 --> 00:26:12,577
Mary: There's no such thing
as consensual anal
with a ten-year old....

594
00:26:14,285 --> 00:26:18,034
( no audible dialogue )

595
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:21,909
He was distraught!
He was, he was--
He didn't make sense!

596
00:26:21,909 --> 00:26:25,951
It was clear whatever
he was talking about
was inappropriate.

597
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:27,159
I-- I got that.

598
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:31,827
So, I called Tim,
and I called, uh, Gary.

599
00:26:31,827 --> 00:26:35,034
And, uh, and, uh--
and if it's true,

600
00:26:35,034 --> 00:26:38,868
I get everybody's upset.
We're upset.

601
00:26:38,868 --> 00:26:41,493
But meanwhile, you gotta--
you gotta let,

602
00:26:41,493 --> 00:26:44,076
uh, legal process unfold--

603
00:26:44,076 --> 00:26:46,410
Scott:
Dad, did you know

604
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:50,118
anything else
about, uh, Jerry?

605
00:26:50,118 --> 00:26:52,326
What do you mean?
Why are you saying that?

606
00:26:52,326 --> 00:26:54,827
- I just told you.
- I don't know, but--

607
00:26:54,827 --> 00:26:57,076
- What about  Jerry?
- When you read it,
you can see

608
00:26:57,076 --> 00:26:58,827
the guy had a clear problem.
Ya know? Maybe--

609
00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:00,368
I didn't read the thing.

610
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:03,034
You told me about the thing...
Scott,

611
00:27:03,034 --> 00:27:04,535
and then you told me again.

612
00:27:04,535 --> 00:27:06,660
- I know. I'm just saying--
- So I know.

613
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,368
So, you're badgering me.

614
00:27:08,368 --> 00:27:09,868
You're badgering me,
I don't like it.

615
00:27:09,868 --> 00:27:11,451
I got a game to prepare for.

616
00:27:11,451 --> 00:27:14,076
That's what's important
to me now, Scott.

617
00:27:14,076 --> 00:27:15,410
Whatever these things are--

618
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:18,034
People think
that you knew
about all of it.

619
00:27:18,034 --> 00:27:21,285
- But I don't care
what people think!
- 2001. 1998.

620
00:27:21,285 --> 00:27:23,410
"Well, JoePa runs the school.
How could he not know?"

621
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,577
Well, I didn't know.
I don't know what they're
talking about.

622
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:27,868
I didn't know--
What-- What am I,
omniscient here?

623
00:27:27,868 --> 00:27:29,993
Well, yeah, that's what
they think you are,

624
00:27:29,993 --> 00:27:31,785
- and they're writing stories.
- Scott: What about rumors?

625
00:27:31,785 --> 00:27:33,535
"There's something funny
about this Jerry guy."

626
00:27:33,535 --> 00:27:34,702
Nothing like that?

627
00:27:34,702 --> 00:27:36,076
What happened to you?

628
00:27:36,076 --> 00:27:38,535
You're telling me
about a rumor?

629
00:27:38,535 --> 00:27:39,827
A rumor?

630
00:27:39,827 --> 00:27:41,034
What's that?

631
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,951
Is that why I sent you
to law school?

632
00:27:42,951 --> 00:27:45,410
Gossip like that,
what it does to people?

633
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:49,076
You have any idea--
What about your Uncle George?

634
00:27:49,076 --> 00:27:51,827
Huh? How come he wasn't married.

635
00:27:51,827 --> 00:27:54,451
Everybody said,
"Something's wrong with him.

636
00:27:54,451 --> 00:27:56,785
Whatever this is,
I don't understand it.

637
00:27:58,827 --> 00:28:00,577
It's garbage!

638
00:28:00,577 --> 00:28:03,285
Jerry Sandusky.
What is he?

639
00:28:03,285 --> 00:28:08,451
I thought he was--
he was unfocused
and such a pain in the butt,

640
00:28:08,451 --> 00:28:12,243
but yes, uh, kids were--

641
00:28:12,243 --> 00:28:14,577
he had kids around all the time.

642
00:28:14,577 --> 00:28:18,410
These were hopeless,
helpless, lost causes.

643
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:21,285
He started the biggest charity
in the history of this state.

644
00:28:21,285 --> 00:28:25,159
Every heavy hitter,
every high roller
donating every week,

645
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:27,951
checks coming in by the dozens.

646
00:28:27,951 --> 00:28:29,785
I never saw anything like it.

647
00:28:29,785 --> 00:28:33,951
He's honored by the president
of the United States.

648
00:28:37,785 --> 00:28:39,285
I got a statement.

649
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:47,702
Sue and I...
have devoted our whole lives
to helping young people.

650
00:28:47,702 --> 00:28:51,618
The fact that someone
we thought we knew

651
00:28:51,618 --> 00:28:54,785
might have harmed young people
like this,

652
00:28:54,785 --> 00:28:57,868
if it's true...

653
00:28:57,868 --> 00:29:02,993
well, we were fooled...
along with a whole bunch
of professionals

654
00:29:02,993 --> 00:29:06,159
who are trained
in this kind of thing.

655
00:29:07,993 --> 00:29:09,368
And we're sorry.

656
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:15,618
We are grieving...

657
00:29:15,618 --> 00:29:17,368
for all of them.

658
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:21,201
( sighs )

659
00:29:21,201 --> 00:29:24,368
We'll release that.

660
00:29:24,368 --> 00:29:26,285
That's the end of it.

661
00:29:26,285 --> 00:29:27,868
I have practice.

662
00:29:29,451 --> 00:29:31,118
( sighs )

663
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:49,201
( crowd cheering )

664
00:29:55,118 --> 00:29:56,577
Man:
Here to say a few words

665
00:29:56,577 --> 00:29:59,243
about our guest of honor
Jerry Sandusky

666
00:29:59,243 --> 00:30:00,827
is his long-time colleague,

667
00:30:00,827 --> 00:30:03,410
mentor and friend
of over 30 years,

668
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:08,743
head coach of Penn State
Nittany Lions, Joe Paterno.

669
00:30:08,743 --> 00:30:11,493
( applause )

670
00:30:13,326 --> 00:30:14,868
Paterno:
Jerry and Dottie,

671
00:30:14,868 --> 00:30:17,535
they always had kids,
they adopted kids,

672
00:30:17,535 --> 00:30:19,076
they-- they fostered children--

673
00:30:19,076 --> 00:30:21,326
all the time,
everywhere I look,

674
00:30:21,326 --> 00:30:23,285
there was kids, kids--
kids kept appearing.

675
00:30:23,285 --> 00:30:25,201
I didn't know what
was goin' on.

676
00:30:25,201 --> 00:30:26,702
I said, "What are they doing?"

677
00:30:26,702 --> 00:30:29,410
I mean, I thought
they were their kids, right?

678
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,909
Little did I know,
it turns out,

679
00:30:31,909 --> 00:30:35,201
Uh, Jerry started this,
uh, charity.

680
00:30:37,868 --> 00:30:42,076
This wonderful thing, ya know?
All these kids, uh--

681
00:30:42,076 --> 00:30:47,201
I had no idea. I had no idea...
( trailing off )

682
00:30:47,201 --> 00:30:49,410
I had no idea.

683
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:53,909
All these kids, all these kids,
all these kids...

684
00:30:53,909 --> 00:30:55,743
Hundreds, hundreds of children.

685
00:30:55,743 --> 00:30:58,493
-Thousands.
- Thousands!

686
00:30:58,493 --> 00:31:00,368
Thousands! Thousands!

687
00:31:00,368 --> 00:31:03,159
- ( laughing )
- That's awesome.

688
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:05,451
( applause )

689
00:31:17,285 --> 00:31:21,451
Coach:
OK, so we'll start with Matt.
He's working out a little bit.

690
00:31:21,451 --> 00:31:23,577
Coach 2:
Watch his knee.

691
00:31:23,577 --> 00:31:24,785
You've gotta
be kiddin' me.

692
00:31:24,785 --> 00:31:26,285
These guys are
fucking animals.

693
00:31:26,285 --> 00:31:27,785
Coach 2: All right,
come on, guys.

694
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:29,785
Closed practice.
Let's go outside, come on!

695
00:31:29,785 --> 00:31:32,743
JoePa's gonna give
his regularly scheduled
press conference tomorrow.

696
00:31:32,743 --> 00:31:34,368
Is this where
the locker room was
where the indicents took place?

697
00:31:34,368 --> 00:31:36,159
Could we just
get a couple shots--

698
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:37,909
Good day to you, sir.
All right, come on.

699
00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:39,618
Outside. Outside, please.

700
00:31:39,618 --> 00:31:42,076
Tom, could we get a lockdown
on the last building, please?

701
00:31:44,326 --> 00:31:47,285
Man: I have no idea
why Mike McQueary is still
on this staff.

702
00:31:47,285 --> 00:31:49,493
He was a 28-year-old man,

703
00:31:49,493 --> 00:31:53,827
and he saw an older man
commit a sexual act
against a ten-year-old,

704
00:31:53,827 --> 00:31:55,368
and did nothing about it.

705
00:31:55,368 --> 00:31:56,785
He walked away,
and went home,

706
00:31:56,785 --> 00:31:58,493
and talked
to his dad about it.

707
00:31:58,493 --> 00:32:00,868
And then decided to see
Joe Paterno the next day.

708
00:32:00,868 --> 00:32:03,702
- ( blows whistle )
- All right, guys,
let's go! Ladder!

709
00:32:20,618 --> 00:32:22,410
- Man: Sara?
- Shh!

710
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:24,159
( whispering )
Are you Sara Ganim?

711
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,326
I'm Hugh Lewison, with NBC.
Do you have a second?

712
00:32:27,326 --> 00:32:29,827
( whispering )
Oh, uh, I don't.
I'm sorry.

713
00:32:29,827 --> 00:32:32,410
I got, I got--
I got, uh, places to go.

714
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:34,577
Just two seconds.
I just need a couple
of phone numbers.

715
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:35,993
- Do you mind?
- Oh, yeah, no.

716
00:32:35,993 --> 00:32:37,285
I have a piece
that's got to run

717
00:32:37,285 --> 00:32:39,118
in, like, ten minutes,

718
00:32:39,118 --> 00:32:40,868
so I got to get
to my interview.

719
00:32:40,868 --> 00:32:42,827
Who are you
interviewing?

720
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:45,326
Um, I'm sorry.

721
00:32:45,326 --> 00:32:47,326
Look, I just drove
four hours to find you.

722
00:32:47,326 --> 00:32:50,577
You're the only goddamn person
who's followed this thing.

723
00:32:50,577 --> 00:32:53,076
Can you tell me why I can't
find a police report from when

724
00:32:53,076 --> 00:32:56,451
McQueary reported
Sandusky in the shower
with the kid in 2001?

725
00:32:56,451 --> 00:32:58,868
I know, it's a real
head-scratcher.

726
00:32:58,868 --> 00:33:01,118
Do you have it?
You don't have to
show it to me.

727
00:33:01,118 --> 00:33:02,159
Just tell me if you've seen it.

728
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,326
Read the article I wrote.

729
00:33:03,326 --> 00:33:04,909
There's no police report
from 2001.

730
00:33:04,909 --> 00:33:07,743
Man: But the indictment says
there was an investigation.

731
00:33:07,743 --> 00:33:09,076
( cell phone ringing )

732
00:33:09,076 --> 00:33:13,118
No? Can you just nod
or shake your head?

733
00:33:13,118 --> 00:33:15,660
I'm being followed
by this guy from NBC.

734
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,326
40 news organizations
want to interview you.

735
00:33:18,326 --> 00:33:20,785
- He's still following me.
- Where are you going?

736
00:33:20,785 --> 00:33:22,410
To interview the mom.

737
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:24,618
You better lose him.
Keep him away from the mom.

738
00:33:24,618 --> 00:33:27,034
This is not
Starksy and Hutch, David.

739
00:33:27,034 --> 00:33:28,743
Go away!

740
00:33:34,577 --> 00:33:35,410
Thank you.

741
00:33:41,076 --> 00:33:42,577
- Woman: Gary?
- Oh, hey.

742
00:33:42,577 --> 00:33:44,618
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. Fine.

743
00:33:44,618 --> 00:33:46,410
They're, uh, gonna
bring me in today,

744
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:47,618
but I don't think
they're gonna keep me.

745
00:33:47,618 --> 00:33:48,868
To jail?

746
00:33:48,868 --> 00:33:50,868
Oh, God, Gar.

747
00:33:50,868 --> 00:33:54,118
- Everything's
gonna be fine, Kim.
- ( sighs )

748
00:33:54,118 --> 00:33:57,034
Hey, uh, listen, Kim.
Could you do me a favor?

749
00:33:57,034 --> 00:33:58,243
Anything.

750
00:33:58,243 --> 00:33:59,785
Go into my office...

751
00:33:59,785 --> 00:34:00,618
OK.

752
00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:02,951
...to the desk.

753
00:34:02,951 --> 00:34:04,201
Yeah?

754
00:34:04,201 --> 00:34:05,827
Unlock the bottom drawer.

755
00:34:08,076 --> 00:34:09,201
Mm-hmm?

756
00:34:09,201 --> 00:34:11,118
You see the transition file?

757
00:34:11,118 --> 00:34:12,868
Yep.

758
00:34:12,868 --> 00:34:15,118
Yeah, could you bring that
to the house?

759
00:34:15,118 --> 00:34:18,493
Of course. Anything else?
You want some food?

760
00:34:18,493 --> 00:34:20,201
No, no, no, no, no. I'm good.

761
00:34:20,201 --> 00:34:24,410
Okay, Gar. Call me
if there's anything at all.

762
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:26,076
Yeah, yeah. Will do. Bye.

763
00:34:29,785 --> 00:34:30,743
( phone beeps )

764
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,159
( players shouting )

765
00:34:41,951 --> 00:34:43,159
( whistle blows )

766
00:34:45,868 --> 00:34:49,702
No, no, no!
Don't hit yourself.
Hit him!

767
00:34:54,993 --> 00:34:55,993
Player: Set!

768
00:34:58,368 --> 00:35:01,493
- They're gonna move us.
- Ganim: How come?

769
00:35:01,493 --> 00:35:02,993
Dawn:
It's not safe.

770
00:35:02,993 --> 00:35:05,451
Since it came out,
people know who he is.

771
00:35:11,535 --> 00:35:13,201
Uh, you don't have to, uh--

772
00:35:13,201 --> 00:35:14,785
Aaron sleeps
on the couch
every night.

773
00:35:14,785 --> 00:35:17,827
Can't sleep in a bed
since Jerry's--

774
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:22,076
Dawn: I don't know what
you need to ask anymore

775
00:35:22,076 --> 00:35:25,493
It's all on the thing online.

776
00:35:27,034 --> 00:35:30,201
He didn't want me
to read it, but...

777
00:35:36,326 --> 00:35:38,868
Ganim: Was there anything
that surprised you?

778
00:35:38,868 --> 00:35:41,034
I-- I didn't want her to know
the parts with, like--

779
00:35:41,034 --> 00:35:43,743
I was never in the room
when he told the whole thing.

780
00:35:43,743 --> 00:35:45,493
Not even at the grand juries.

781
00:35:45,493 --> 00:35:47,660
I wanted to.

782
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:52,410
I mean...
it was so hard for him.

783
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:54,034
He fainted, threw up--

784
00:35:54,034 --> 00:35:55,034
Mom.

785
00:35:55,034 --> 00:35:57,535
He says testifying was--

786
00:35:57,535 --> 00:35:58,743
Can I say?

787
00:36:01,535 --> 00:36:03,201
He says the grand jury
testimonies

788
00:36:03,201 --> 00:36:07,410
were the worst things
he's ever had to do
in his life.

789
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:08,285
Other than...

790
00:36:18,702 --> 00:36:20,326
I am sorry you have
to talk about this again--

791
00:36:20,326 --> 00:36:21,909
It's bullshit, okay?

792
00:36:24,493 --> 00:36:26,702
Jerry's already out.

793
00:36:26,702 --> 00:36:29,993
The judge was a volunteer
at the Second Mile.
Sent him home.

794
00:36:29,993 --> 00:36:31,118
Unsecured bail.

795
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,034
It's been three years.

796
00:36:37,034 --> 00:36:38,827
From the first day,
it's the same thing--

797
00:36:38,827 --> 00:36:41,285
- ( phone ringing )
- Shit. I'm sorry.

798
00:36:41,285 --> 00:36:45,285
Let me just try
and silence this thing.

799
00:36:45,285 --> 00:36:48,702
Um, what were you saying?
The, uh, first three--

800
00:36:48,702 --> 00:36:49,951
It's been three years?

801
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:57,951
We reported it at the school
as soon as he said somethin'.

802
00:36:57,951 --> 00:37:01,618
We went to the principal,
Karen Probst.

803
00:37:01,618 --> 00:37:04,827
Write her name down.
Fucking bitch.

804
00:37:04,827 --> 00:37:09,618
You know what she said?
She told me, when I said,

805
00:37:09,618 --> 00:37:12,785
"Call the police,
that man touched my kid,"

806
00:37:12,785 --> 00:37:16,034
she said, "I think you should
go home and sleep on it,

807
00:37:16,034 --> 00:37:19,702
because I'm not sure this
is something you wanna do.

808
00:37:19,702 --> 00:37:22,660
You're very emotional."

809
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:25,702
She put in
a cover-your-ass call

810
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:28,993
to Child Services once
we were already there.

811
00:37:28,993 --> 00:37:30,660
If we hadn't raised hell,

812
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,493
she would have pretended
the whole thing never happened.

813
00:37:33,493 --> 00:37:37,660
Oh, that Jerry--
he's got a heart of gold.

814
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:41,034
Everybody loves him.

815
00:37:41,034 --> 00:37:43,368
He's not going to jail.

816
00:37:43,368 --> 00:37:45,285
I'm just gonna be another kid
on the front page

817
00:37:45,285 --> 00:37:47,993
in the newspaper
with a big "liar"
stamped across his head.

818
00:37:47,993 --> 00:37:51,660
Ganim: Look, I don't know how
this case is gonna turn out,

819
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,868
but I can tell you
that right now
people look at you

820
00:37:53,868 --> 00:37:56,243
as the first person that's had
the courage to come forward

821
00:37:56,243 --> 00:37:59,868
and stand up to a really
intimidating public figure.

822
00:37:59,868 --> 00:38:02,201
And because
of what you did,

823
00:38:02,201 --> 00:38:04,743
now five other guys have had
the courage to come forward

824
00:38:04,743 --> 00:38:06,909
and do the same thing.

825
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:10,201
There's no grand jury
investigation without you.

826
00:38:10,201 --> 00:38:12,076
You started this whole thing.

827
00:38:14,201 --> 00:38:15,577
And if you didn't
say anything,

828
00:38:15,577 --> 00:38:17,201
Jerry would still be
hanging out

829
00:38:17,201 --> 00:38:19,285
at Second Mile
with a bunch of kids,

830
00:38:19,285 --> 00:38:20,909
trying to pick his favorite.

831
00:38:31,368 --> 00:38:34,535
Bobby, go find Kate.
Go! She's at dance.

832
00:38:37,368 --> 00:38:38,577
That's Aaron's brother.

833
00:38:38,577 --> 00:38:40,243
He's ten.

834
00:38:40,243 --> 00:38:41,993
Yeah, that's how old
I was when--

835
00:38:45,034 --> 00:38:46,159
( whistle blows )

836
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:50,702
( chatter )

837
00:38:54,076 --> 00:38:56,451
So, uh...

838
00:38:56,451 --> 00:38:59,326
just keep it
to football tomorrow...

839
00:38:59,326 --> 00:39:00,827
at the press conference.

840
00:39:00,827 --> 00:39:01,743
Yeah, I know.

841
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:06,326
Did you read it?

842
00:39:06,326 --> 00:39:08,326
No, I didn't
read it yet, Jay.

843
00:39:08,326 --> 00:39:09,951
I didn't--
How am I gonna
read it?

844
00:39:09,951 --> 00:39:11,243
( scoffs )

845
00:39:11,243 --> 00:39:12,909
After Nebraska,
I haven't--

846
00:39:12,909 --> 00:39:14,410
I haven't
had the time.

847
00:39:16,076 --> 00:39:17,827
You know,
Scott gets worked up.

848
00:39:17,827 --> 00:39:19,702
Your mother gets worked up.

849
00:39:19,702 --> 00:39:23,076
That's not my job.
Understand?

850
00:39:23,076 --> 00:39:23,951
Or your job.

851
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:28,118
We don't get worked up.

852
00:39:28,118 --> 00:39:31,618
You get hysterical
every time your team
gets attacked,

853
00:39:31,618 --> 00:39:33,326
that's a short career.

854
00:39:37,201 --> 00:39:39,951
Man:
Ya have to wonder right now
where Joe Paterno's head is.

855
00:39:39,951 --> 00:39:42,785
So much is swirling around him.
And, you know,

856
00:39:42,785 --> 00:39:44,368
maybe there's a little bit
of a disconnect,

857
00:39:44,368 --> 00:39:46,410
maybe he doesn't
fully understand

858
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:47,951
the gravity of what's going on,
you know, he's talking

859
00:39:47,951 --> 00:39:49,951
about beating Nebraska
on Saturday.

860
00:39:51,076 --> 00:39:52,909
Man:
Good hit, good hit.

861
00:40:15,535 --> 00:40:17,785
Reporter:
Is coach Paterno
under investigation as well?

862
00:40:17,785 --> 00:40:21,285
No, he's not regarded
as a target at this point.

863
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:22,618
But somebody needs to question

864
00:40:22,618 --> 00:40:25,118
what I believe
is the moral requirements

865
00:40:25,118 --> 00:40:26,868
for a human being that knows

866
00:40:26,868 --> 00:40:29,535
that sexual things
that are happening to a child.

867
00:40:29,535 --> 00:40:31,993
( continues on TV):
No whether you're
a football coach,

868
00:40:31,993 --> 00:40:33,451
or the university president,

869
00:40:33,451 --> 00:40:36,451
or the guy sweeping out
the building,

870
00:40:36,451 --> 00:40:40,660
I feel that you have
a moral obligation
to call us.

871
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,827
Woman:
Commissioner, thank you
so much for being here.

872
00:40:42,827 --> 00:40:45,493
I know you spent 30 years
with the FBI,

873
00:40:45,493 --> 00:40:47,868
you say you have
never seen anything

874
00:40:47,868 --> 00:40:51,118
like the alleged sexual abuse
allegations in this case,

875
00:40:51,118 --> 00:40:56,577
and you say you want to know
why the police were not called.

876
00:40:56,577 --> 00:41:00,702
I don't want to criticize
Joe Paterno or anybody else.

877
00:41:00,702 --> 00:41:03,868
But any human being who has
this kind of information,

878
00:41:03,868 --> 00:41:07,243
or who has knowledge of child
sexual abuse, should call us--

879
00:41:07,243 --> 00:41:09,827
- ( TV off )
- Sue: Nobody wants to ask

880
00:41:09,827 --> 00:41:11,827
why Mike McQueary
didn't call the police.

881
00:41:11,827 --> 00:41:14,743
I mean, he was
the one who was there.
He's a grown man.

882
00:41:14,743 --> 00:41:16,577
He comes into my kitchen.

883
00:41:16,577 --> 00:41:19,118
Dad went
to who he thought
was  the police.

884
00:41:19,118 --> 00:41:21,577
Ga-- Gary ran
the campus police.

885
00:41:21,577 --> 00:41:22,702
Right, Scotty?

886
00:41:22,702 --> 00:41:24,993
Gary also knew
about that thing in 1998

887
00:41:24,993 --> 00:41:25,993
and did nothing about it.

888
00:41:27,034 --> 00:41:29,285
Wait, what thing in 1998?

889
00:41:29,285 --> 00:41:31,368
Scott:
There was another kid, Ma.

890
00:41:31,368 --> 00:41:33,868
In the shower,
in the Lasch building.

891
00:41:33,868 --> 00:41:36,201
That kid told his mom,
his mom called the cops.

892
00:41:36,201 --> 00:41:37,909
The cops got Jerry
over to the kid's house

893
00:41:37,909 --> 00:41:39,993
while they were
in the other room listening.

894
00:41:39,993 --> 00:41:42,702
W-While Jerry's there?

895
00:41:42,702 --> 00:41:44,368
- Yes.
- Yeah.

896
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:48,743
And the mom says,
"You can't do this
ever again with anyone,"

897
00:41:48,743 --> 00:41:52,909
and Jerry says,
"I can't promise that"
with the cops listening.

898
00:41:52,909 --> 00:41:54,951
And they don't arrest him.
They just say,

899
00:41:54,951 --> 00:41:56,660
"Don't shower
with little boys."

900
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,702
That was the end of it.

901
00:41:57,702 --> 00:41:59,118
How was that the end of it?

902
00:41:59,118 --> 00:42:01,909
Because all they had
was showering and hugging.

903
00:42:01,909 --> 00:42:02,909
Not a crime.

904
00:42:02,909 --> 00:42:04,743
A hug goodbye?

905
00:42:04,743 --> 00:42:07,201
Mary:
No. Naked, wet hugging.

906
00:42:07,201 --> 00:42:08,993
Sue:
And that's not a crime?

907
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:14,159
Because the DA,
for some ungodly reason,
decided that it wasn't.

908
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:19,618
Well, why isn't anyone talking
about the DA's moral obligation?

909
00:42:19,618 --> 00:42:21,702
Did Gary tell you
about that one too?

910
00:42:21,702 --> 00:42:24,201
Guido:
Why do you think the police
commissioner is trying to say

911
00:42:24,201 --> 00:42:26,410
that Joe has got
a moral responsibility?

912
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:27,743
It's because they missed it.

913
00:42:27,743 --> 00:42:30,118
You know what?
Everybody missed it.
Everybody!

914
00:42:30,118 --> 00:42:31,451
How come no one's talking

915
00:42:31,451 --> 00:42:33,285
about the frickin'
Second Mile, huh?

916
00:42:33,285 --> 00:42:34,951
Those idiots.
They were told
what happened,

917
00:42:34,951 --> 00:42:36,451
and nobody decided to say,

918
00:42:36,451 --> 00:42:37,868
"Hey, maybe we should
keep this guy away

919
00:42:37,868 --> 00:42:38,909
from the hundreds
of little boys

920
00:42:38,909 --> 00:42:39,951
we got running around"?

921
00:42:39,951 --> 00:42:41,577
What was Gary thinking?

922
00:42:41,577 --> 00:42:43,243
Listen to this.

923
00:42:43,243 --> 00:42:45,743
"Schultz, equivocating
on the definition of 'sexua''

924
00:42:45,743 --> 00:42:48,118
in the context
of Sandusky wrestling with

925
00:42:48,118 --> 00:42:50,410
and grabbing the genitals
of the boy--"

926
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:54,326
I mean, who equivocates
on grabbing a kid's genitals.

927
00:42:54,326 --> 00:42:57,285
Okay, let's go.
Let me have that thing.

928
00:43:04,076 --> 00:43:06,034
( chatter )

929
00:43:11,076 --> 00:43:12,993
( doorbell rings )

930
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:16,368
- Oh, great. Thank you.
- Of course.

931
00:43:16,368 --> 00:43:17,660
Is there anything else
I can do?

932
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:18,993
No. No, you better go.

933
00:43:18,993 --> 00:43:20,577
You don't want 'em
getting interested in you.

934
00:43:20,577 --> 00:43:24,909
Yeah, um, I grabbed
another file
in case you need it.

935
00:43:24,909 --> 00:43:27,285
Oh, great. Thanks.

936
00:43:27,285 --> 00:43:28,535
Okay.

937
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:15,827
An hour shower?

938
00:44:15,827 --> 00:44:19,285
Same as what happened
three years ago in '98.

939
00:44:19,285 --> 00:44:22,702
Why does the man
still have keys
to the building?

940
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:26,493
It's part
of his retirement deal.

941
00:44:26,493 --> 00:44:30,993
Just tell the man
he can't come in here
with little boys.

942
00:44:30,993 --> 00:44:33,076
Cops told him that
the first time it happened.

943
00:44:33,076 --> 00:44:35,201
Didn't seem to make
much of an impression.

944
00:44:35,201 --> 00:44:39,076
Sit down with the guy
and explain that,

945
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:42,909
under no circumstances, can he
come into university facilities

946
00:44:42,909 --> 00:44:44,076
with a child.

947
00:44:44,076 --> 00:44:47,493
No workouts.
No goddamn showering.

948
00:44:47,493 --> 00:44:49,951
All right, so we--
we talk to the charity,

949
00:44:49,951 --> 00:44:53,743
we talk to Jerry,
and we call Child Welfare.

950
00:44:55,577 --> 00:44:57,868
And they will file it
with the police?

951
00:44:57,868 --> 00:44:59,368
Yeah.

952
00:45:02,326 --> 00:45:04,618
This is a fucking nightmare.

953
00:45:13,785 --> 00:45:15,451
Man:
Will the court officer now read

954
00:45:15,451 --> 00:45:18,785
the charges
against Gerald A. Sandusky?

955
00:45:18,785 --> 00:45:21,909
Woman:
Sandusky performed oral sex
on Victim One

956
00:45:21,909 --> 00:45:23,868
on a number of occasions,

957
00:45:23,868 --> 00:45:27,285
had Victim One perform
oral sex on him,

958
00:45:27,285 --> 00:45:30,451
gives Nike shoes,
ice hockey equipment...

959
00:45:30,451 --> 00:45:33,451
...overnight at his residence,
basement, bedroom,

960
00:45:33,451 --> 00:45:37,118
performed oral sex on him
more than 20 times.

961
00:45:37,118 --> 00:45:40,618
Victim Four.
Attend the pre-game banquet,

962
00:45:40,618 --> 00:45:43,285
sits with Sandusky
at the coach's table...

963
00:45:43,285 --> 00:45:45,451
hotel room...
the Alamo Bowl...

964
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:49,159
...Inserts his erect penis
into Victim Four's mouth.

965
00:45:49,159 --> 00:45:52,159
Attempted to penetrate
Victim Four's anus

966
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:53,909
both with a finger
and his penis.

967
00:45:53,909 --> 00:45:55,827
(trailing off)

968
00:46:02,827 --> 00:46:04,493
What is  sodomy?

969
00:46:04,493 --> 00:46:05,951
Scott:
Oh, come on.

970
00:46:05,951 --> 00:46:08,993
Uh, Achilles,
and, uh, Patroclus?

971
00:46:10,493 --> 00:46:12,785
Nessus
and, uh, uh, Uralus.

972
00:46:12,785 --> 00:46:15,118
W-What does he know
about these perverted things?

973
00:46:30,201 --> 00:46:31,993
Joe's having
a press conference today,

974
00:46:31,993 --> 00:46:34,034
so if we could do this
as quick as possible,

975
00:46:34,034 --> 00:46:35,285
I'd like to get over there.

976
00:46:35,285 --> 00:46:38,451
Do you have a hairbrush
or a comb?

977
00:46:38,451 --> 00:46:40,909
- In your bag?
- Uh, no. no.

978
00:46:40,909 --> 00:46:43,702
- Lipstick?
-  Uh, no. No.

979
00:46:43,702 --> 00:46:45,827
Huge bag and you don't
have anything.

980
00:46:45,827 --> 00:46:46,909
- What?
- Okay.

981
00:46:46,909 --> 00:46:48,201
Um, what do we think
about this coat?

982
00:46:48,201 --> 00:46:49,702
I think it's gonna strobe.

983
00:46:49,702 --> 00:46:51,577
Yeah. Let's, uh,
let's take it off.

984
00:46:51,577 --> 00:46:53,159
- Take the coat off?
- Mh-hmm.

985
00:46:53,159 --> 00:46:54,451
I've got,
like, a yellow...

986
00:46:54,451 --> 00:46:56,034
yellow shirt on I can wear.

987
00:46:56,034 --> 00:46:58,201
Oh...

988
00:46:58,201 --> 00:47:00,702
Uh, you know what?
Let's keep it on.

989
00:47:00,702 --> 00:47:04,034
- The coat-- on?
- Mh-hmm. Mh-hmm. Button up.

990
00:47:04,034 --> 00:47:05,201
Button up.

991
00:47:05,201 --> 00:47:07,368
Yeah, it's gonna
help you.

992
00:47:07,368 --> 00:47:09,785
Man: Legendary head coach
Joe Paterno getting ready

993
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:12,326
for what may be the toughest
press conference of his life
today.

994
00:47:12,326 --> 00:47:14,702
Man 2:
These will be his first
on-camera statements

995
00:47:14,702 --> 00:47:18,951
since this scandal broke,
and the stakes are incredibly
high for him.

996
00:47:18,951 --> 00:47:21,660
Guido: Okay, that statement
we put out the other day,
it had no impact.

997
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:23,868
We do it today,
we do it head on,

998
00:47:23,868 --> 00:47:25,909
on camera, and then it's over.

999
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:27,493
Joe:
All right, McQueary told me

1000
00:47:27,493 --> 00:47:30,076
he saw something
inappropriate,

1001
00:47:30,076 --> 00:47:33,159
so the next day I called Tim,

1002
00:47:33,159 --> 00:47:34,577
- Wait, wait--
- and he came over.

1003
00:47:34,577 --> 00:47:36,118
Scott:
You called him when?

1004
00:47:36,118 --> 00:47:38,535
I called him the next day.

1005
00:47:38,535 --> 00:47:40,909
It was Saturday. Oh,
it was Saturday, yeah.

1006
00:47:40,909 --> 00:47:43,577
I got the call, I waited
till the weekend was over

1007
00:47:43,577 --> 00:47:46,702
'cause I, you know,
I wasn't gonna ruin his weekend.

1008
00:47:46,702 --> 00:47:49,285
- He's got kids.
- Don't say that.

1009
00:47:49,285 --> 00:47:51,285
Scott asked a question.

1010
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,243
Well, do you
want me to lie?

1011
00:47:53,243 --> 00:47:55,577
You can't say
that you heard
about child abuse,

1012
00:47:55,577 --> 00:47:58,951
and then you waited
a couple days so you didn't
ruin someone's weekend.

1013
00:47:58,951 --> 00:48:02,034
I mean, presumably the rape
ruined the child's weekend--

1014
00:48:02,034 --> 00:48:03,827
- Mary Kay.
- But put it this way:

1015
00:48:03,827 --> 00:48:05,743
You hear about someone
diddling my kids?

1016
00:48:05,743 --> 00:48:07,326
Don't wait the weekend!

1017
00:48:07,326 --> 00:48:10,577
She's right, she's right.
You can't say it, okay?

1018
00:48:10,577 --> 00:48:12,451
- So, what do I say?
- OK, this should be football.

1019
00:48:12,451 --> 00:48:15,034
Right? It's a weekly
football press conference!

1020
00:48:15,034 --> 00:48:17,118
I mean, what are we doing?
We're sittin' around--

1021
00:48:17,118 --> 00:48:19,618
They're standing out there.
There's people--

1022
00:48:19,618 --> 00:48:21,451
Everybody wants to know
what happened.

1023
00:48:21,451 --> 00:48:23,076
That's right. You do it,
and then it's done.

1024
00:48:23,076 --> 00:48:25,410
- Right.
- Okay. Sure.

1025
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:29,285
- So, where were we?
Did you call the police?
- ( Sue sighs )

1026
00:48:29,285 --> 00:48:32,201
But it is a press conference,
Scott. It's not a deposition.

1027
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:34,451
Scott: It's gonna be a lot
worse than a deposition, Dad,
this is the media.

1028
00:48:34,451 --> 00:48:35,993
They got nothing
to eat but you.

1029
00:48:35,993 --> 00:48:37,660
So the press is going
to ask you

1030
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:39,243
why didn't you
pick up the phone
yourself?

1031
00:48:39,243 --> 00:48:43,243
Michael McQueary was a mess
when he talked to me.

1032
00:48:43,243 --> 00:48:45,201
Mary Kay:
What did the kid say happened?

1033
00:48:45,201 --> 00:48:49,660
I didn't talk to the kids.
I talked to McQueary.

1034
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:52,410
Wait, so--
So who talked
to the kid?

1035
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:53,660
Was it Gary?

1036
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:55,368
I don't know
who talked to the kid.

1037
00:48:55,368 --> 00:48:56,660
I don't know.
Who knows?

1038
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:57,660
Was he okay?

1039
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:00,159
- Okay, who?
- The child.

1040
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:02,326
Guido: I don't think
the press is gonna get
into this, hon.

1041
00:49:02,326 --> 00:49:04,201
No, I'm asking, Guido.

1042
00:49:04,201 --> 00:49:07,201
I mean, the kid knows
what happened.
What did he say?

1043
00:49:07,201 --> 00:49:09,785
( clears throat )
Well, I think nobody talked
to the kid.

1044
00:49:09,785 --> 00:49:11,285
They-- they didn't find the kid.

1045
00:49:11,285 --> 00:49:12,201
( coughs )

1046
00:49:13,827 --> 00:49:16,034
I don't-- I don't
understand what the--

1047
00:49:16,034 --> 00:49:17,993
How could they not
find the kid?

1048
00:49:17,993 --> 00:49:19,660
They could
just ask Jerry.

1049
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:23,577
Well, they didn't look for him.
It was an oversight.

1050
00:49:23,577 --> 00:49:26,034
- Wow.
- Oversight.

1051
00:49:26,034 --> 00:49:30,410
So did you ask about the kid
and they just never followed up?

1052
00:49:33,243 --> 00:49:34,868
Guido:
Mary Kay.

1053
00:49:34,868 --> 00:49:37,201
- But, did you ask?
- What are we doin' here?

1054
00:49:38,577 --> 00:49:40,326
Did you ask?

1055
00:49:42,868 --> 00:49:45,368
Man: This is more
than a football legacy.

1056
00:49:45,368 --> 00:49:50,076
This is about people,
and if we can't protect
our kids,

1057
00:49:50,076 --> 00:49:53,076
we, as a society, are pathetic.

1058
00:49:53,076 --> 00:49:55,243
- Gar. It's Kim.
- Hey.

1059
00:49:55,243 --> 00:49:57,451
- You back home?
- Yeah.

1060
00:49:57,451 --> 00:49:59,326
Good. You okay?

1061
00:49:59,326 --> 00:50:01,827
Uh, yeah, super.
Listen, Kim, I really--

1062
00:50:01,827 --> 00:50:03,243
I made a copy...

1063
00:50:03,243 --> 00:50:07,743
of the file...
in the envelope.

1064
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:10,785
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

1065
00:50:10,785 --> 00:50:11,785
It's okay.

1066
00:50:11,785 --> 00:50:13,577
It's habit, you know?

1067
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:16,410
I don't take anything
from the file without a copy.

1068
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:18,243
Yeah, of course. Of course.

1069
00:50:18,243 --> 00:50:22,909
Um...I gave you
the original, Gar.

1070
00:50:22,909 --> 00:50:24,660
I shouldn't have done that.

1071
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:27,243
Oh, it's fine, Kim.

1072
00:50:27,243 --> 00:50:28,785
Look, I'll bring 'em back
in the morning.

1073
00:50:28,785 --> 00:50:31,951
No, they won't let you
in the building.

1074
00:50:31,951 --> 00:50:36,076
( sighs )
I'm concerned
about hiding evidence

1075
00:50:36,076 --> 00:50:38,118
if the originals are gone.

1076
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:41,326
There's, like,
fingerprints and things.

1077
00:50:41,326 --> 00:50:44,159
They look into all that.

1078
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:46,076
What if they ask me about it?

1079
00:50:48,451 --> 00:50:52,951
I don't know, Kim.
Just tell 'em the truth.

1080
00:50:52,951 --> 00:50:56,909
Okay. Okay.

1081
00:50:56,909 --> 00:50:58,410
Thanks.

1082
00:51:02,451 --> 00:51:07,577
Curley ( over phone ):
Look, I met with Joe.
We talked about it, and...

1083
00:51:07,577 --> 00:51:09,827
to go behind Jerry's back
to his own organization

1084
00:51:09,827 --> 00:51:11,618
and the Department
of Child Welfare

1085
00:51:11,618 --> 00:51:13,785
before we've even looked
at the guy face-to-face

1086
00:51:13,785 --> 00:51:16,618
and asked him what happened

1087
00:51:16,618 --> 00:51:20,118
seems...
I don't know, inhumane.

1088
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:21,951
What happened
to calling Child Welfare?

1089
00:51:21,951 --> 00:51:23,785
And, uh, fucking Second Mile?

1090
00:51:23,785 --> 00:51:26,660
Look, we just gotta
ask the guy what happened.

1091
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:29,785
I mean, maybe-- I don't know,
maybe it's a misunderstanding.

1092
00:51:29,785 --> 00:51:31,868
Graham agrees. Joe agrees.

1093
00:51:34,326 --> 00:51:36,201
( Paterno moans)

1094
00:51:37,326 --> 00:51:38,702
Who's driving?

1095
00:51:38,702 --> 00:51:40,159
Jay: Uh, come in my car.

1096
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:42,451
I'll drop you home
after practice.

1097
00:51:42,451 --> 00:51:44,201
Yeah, there's a couple
of reporters out there.

1098
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:46,076
Keep em to the side
so we don't run anybody down.

1099
00:51:46,076 --> 00:51:47,493
- Yeah.
- What do you mean?

1100
00:51:47,493 --> 00:51:49,993
Why-- Why aren't they
at the press conference?

1101
00:51:49,993 --> 00:51:51,451
Probably wanna follow you there.

1102
00:51:51,451 --> 00:51:52,993
Hey, you can moon 'em
on the way.

1103
00:51:52,993 --> 00:51:54,827
Scott, that's not
appropriate right now.

1104
00:51:56,951 --> 00:51:58,743
Says who?

1105
00:51:58,743 --> 00:52:03,326
Guys, they don't want
to do it right now.
The press conference.

1106
00:52:03,326 --> 00:52:05,285
We got practice
in 40 minutes.
It's now or never.

1107
00:52:05,285 --> 00:52:07,410
Yeah, well,
they don't want
a press conference today.

1108
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:09,535
It's cancelled.

1109
00:52:09,535 --> 00:52:12,243
Without my permission?

1110
00:52:12,243 --> 00:52:14,285
Guido: Yeah.

1111
00:52:14,285 --> 00:52:17,076
Man:
Due to the ongoing
legal circumstances

1112
00:52:17,076 --> 00:52:19,785
surrendered around the recent
allegations and charges,

1113
00:52:19,785 --> 00:52:22,034
we have determined
that today's press conference

1114
00:52:22,034 --> 00:52:24,326
cannot be held
and will not be rescheduled.

1115
00:52:24,326 --> 00:52:26,618
We will not have
any additional comments
on this matter.

1116
00:52:26,618 --> 00:52:28,993
Woman: Never?
It won't ever be rescheduled?

1117
00:52:28,993 --> 00:52:30,702
Man:
Don't you guys feel
you have an obligation

1118
00:52:30,702 --> 00:52:31,702
to talk about this?

1119
00:52:33,493 --> 00:52:34,827
"Crime & Punishment,"
new developments

1120
00:52:34,827 --> 00:52:36,660
in the child sex abuse scandal
that has rocked

1121
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:38,243
Penn State's
legendary football program.

1122
00:52:38,243 --> 00:52:39,993
Today a regular
weekly news conference

1123
00:52:39,993 --> 00:52:42,243
with Penn State's head coach
Joe Paterno was canceled.

1124
00:52:42,243 --> 00:52:44,326
It would have been his first
since the scandal broke.

1125
00:52:44,326 --> 00:52:46,243
Reporters were waiting
when he left practice.

1126
00:52:46,243 --> 00:52:49,243
- ( reporters clamor )
- Guys, you got good questions,

1127
00:52:49,243 --> 00:52:51,660
but I can't--
I can't answer them.

1128
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:55,076
Sorry. I just can't do it.

1129
00:52:55,076 --> 00:52:56,827
Cooper:
So far, two top
university officials,

1130
00:52:56,827 --> 00:52:58,285
Timothy Curley
and Gary Schultz,

1131
00:52:58,285 --> 00:53:00,410
have been charged
with failing to report

1132
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:03,577
allegations of abuse
that occurred on university
property.

1133
00:53:03,577 --> 00:53:05,993
Sara Ganim, a reporter
at The Patriot-News.

1134
00:53:05,993 --> 00:53:08,368
Sara, you spoke to two
of the moms of the victims

1135
00:53:08,368 --> 00:53:09,827
allegedly
sexually molested by Sandusky.

1136
00:53:09,827 --> 00:53:11,076
What did they tell you?

1137
00:53:11,076 --> 00:53:15,410
I mean, both of them
are extremely--

1138
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:19,993
feeling extremely let down
and betrayed by Penn State,

1139
00:53:19,993 --> 00:53:23,201
and those feelings
are coming from the charges

1140
00:53:23,201 --> 00:53:25,618
levied against him,
Curley, and Gary Schultz,

1141
00:53:25,618 --> 00:53:29,785
and then, the, uh, moral
allegations basically--

1142
00:53:29,785 --> 00:53:31,868
- ( plane flies over )
- Uh, I hope you can hear me,

1143
00:53:31,868 --> 00:53:34,451
there's loud airplanes
flying above us--

1144
00:53:34,451 --> 00:53:37,577
--uh, against Joe Paterno
and Graham Spanier.

1145
00:53:37,577 --> 00:53:40,577
Um, and, uh, one mom
in particular,

1146
00:53:40,577 --> 00:53:43,660
her son came forward in 1998,
was not believed,

1147
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:47,285
and, uh, they feel awful
that other children

1148
00:53:47,285 --> 00:53:49,577
were victimized because
her son was not believed.

1149
00:53:51,785 --> 00:53:54,868
Woman:
The university cancelled
Paterno's news conference

1150
00:53:54,868 --> 00:53:56,785
just minutes before
it was scheduled to begin,

1151
00:53:56,785 --> 00:53:59,535
and the school freely admits
that the reason is because

1152
00:53:59,535 --> 00:54:03,451
of the child rape scandal
marring Paterno's program.

1153
00:54:03,451 --> 00:54:07,660
Calls for Paterno's resignation
are really starting to pile up.

1154
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:09,326
Guido: I think it's time
to call somebody.

1155
00:54:09,326 --> 00:54:10,785
We need tactical advice.

1156
00:54:10,785 --> 00:54:13,159
- Like a crisis guy.
- Perfect. Who do you got?

1157
00:54:13,159 --> 00:54:15,868
- ( sighs ) I don't know.
- Let me Google it.

1158
00:54:15,868 --> 00:54:17,118
Jay:
You're Googling it?

1159
00:54:17,118 --> 00:54:18,535
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's great.

1160
00:54:18,535 --> 00:54:20,243
Jay:
We're a major university

1161
00:54:20,243 --> 00:54:22,243
in the middle of a very serious
public relations debacle,

1162
00:54:22,243 --> 00:54:23,909
and you're solving it on Google.

1163
00:54:23,909 --> 00:54:25,410
- Joe!
- Mary Kay: Is that
what I want,

1164
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:27,034
though, a public
relations spin?

1165
00:54:27,034 --> 00:54:28,702
- Scott: PR's marketing.
- Sue: Joe!

1166
00:54:28,702 --> 00:54:30,743
We already got a marketing guy
sittin' right here.

1167
00:54:30,743 --> 00:54:32,285
- So what, then?
- Give me your phone.

1168
00:54:32,285 --> 00:54:33,951
- No, I can do it.
- Give me your phone!

1169
00:54:33,951 --> 00:54:36,076
Tell me what to put in.
What, like, a crisis manager?

1170
00:54:36,076 --> 00:54:37,577
- That sounds about right!
- No, no, no.

1171
00:54:37,577 --> 00:54:39,368
Crisis management.
A crisis management firm.

1172
00:54:39,368 --> 00:54:41,368
- Okay, I'm good now.
- What's the difference?

1173
00:54:41,368 --> 00:54:44,076
Why aren't all these
reporters over at Jerry's?

1174
00:54:44,076 --> 00:54:45,660
I'm calling Frank.
He knows somebody

1175
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:47,243
who deals
with this kind of thing.

1176
00:54:47,243 --> 00:54:48,368
The car guy?

1177
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:49,618
You're giving me crap
for Google,

1178
00:54:49,618 --> 00:54:50,702
and you want advice
from Frank

1179
00:54:50,702 --> 00:54:52,368
at the car dealership?

1180
00:54:52,368 --> 00:54:54,159
Doesn't the school
have a crisis manager?

1181
00:54:54,159 --> 00:54:55,493
Does it look
like the school has a--

1182
00:54:57,201 --> 00:54:58,535
Sorry, Ma.

1183
00:54:58,535 --> 00:55:00,493
- Okay. McGinn and Company.
- Okay.

1184
00:55:00,493 --> 00:55:03,368
Dan McGinn. "Helping clients
solve their most perplexing

1185
00:55:03,368 --> 00:55:05,909
and important
reputation challenges."

1186
00:55:05,909 --> 00:55:08,034
Huh? What is he, like,
on a top ten list?

1187
00:55:08,034 --> 00:55:09,743
Yeah, he's on a top ten list.

1188
00:55:09,743 --> 00:55:12,076
- Should I call him?
- Yeah, call him.

1189
00:55:12,076 --> 00:55:14,368
Sure, why not?

1190
00:55:14,368 --> 00:55:16,410
Scott:
Ask for Dan McGinn.

1191
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:18,660
Mary Kay:
Oh, hi, hi. May I speak with--

1192
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:19,535
Scott: Dan McGinn.

1193
00:55:40,159 --> 00:55:43,034
Ha. You're walkin' weird,
man, you get Sandusky'd
last night?

1194
00:55:43,034 --> 00:55:45,702
Yeah, he sucked me off
and then we played Xbox.

1195
00:55:45,702 --> 00:55:47,827
- Boy 1: It's a lie.
- Boy 2: What?

1196
00:55:47,827 --> 00:55:50,909
- Some fuckin' piece
of trailer trash set him up.
- Jerry?

1197
00:55:50,909 --> 00:55:53,451
Yeah. Kid probably tried
to blackmail him,

1198
00:55:53,451 --> 00:55:55,577
Jerry told him to fuck off,
and he's like,

1199
00:55:55,577 --> 00:55:57,535
"I'm gonna sue your ass
for $20 million

1200
00:55:57,535 --> 00:55:59,660
- for damage to my rectum."
- ( laughter )

1201
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:01,243
Total fabrication.

1202
00:56:01,243 --> 00:56:04,368
It's somebody
from the track team.

1203
00:56:04,368 --> 00:56:05,743
Our track team?

1204
00:56:05,743 --> 00:56:06,868
Yeah.

1205
00:56:08,243 --> 00:56:09,827
Did you see about JoePa?

1206
00:56:09,827 --> 00:56:12,285
Of course I saw it, man.

1207
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:14,159
I don't even want
to talk about that.

1208
00:56:20,201 --> 00:56:21,618
Hey. Yo, you the faggot?

1209
00:56:23,326 --> 00:56:25,493
- Hey. Hey.
- Get him, get him!

1210
00:56:28,951 --> 00:56:29,827
Go! Go!

1211
00:56:34,951 --> 00:56:36,660
No showers, huh?!

1212
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:38,493
Showers?

1213
00:56:38,493 --> 00:56:40,660
Trash? Huh?

1214
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:44,785
I'm gonna beat your ass, kid.
You fucking faggot!

1215
00:56:51,827 --> 00:56:54,159
( typing )

1216
00:56:57,827 --> 00:57:00,326
Man ( over phone ):
I'm happy to come down, Guido.

1217
00:57:00,326 --> 00:57:02,326
I've been watching
the coverage.

1218
00:57:02,326 --> 00:57:04,285
It sure looks like things
have begun to spin out.

1219
00:57:04,285 --> 00:57:07,285
Yeah. It's making this school
look like shit.

1220
00:57:07,285 --> 00:57:09,034
They have no idea
how to get in front of it.

1221
00:57:09,034 --> 00:57:10,909
I'm sorry, you lost me
for a second there.

1222
00:57:10,909 --> 00:57:13,034
Are you looking for advice
for Coach Paterno,

1223
00:57:13,034 --> 00:57:14,159
or for the university?

1224
00:57:14,159 --> 00:57:16,201
For both.

1225
00:57:16,201 --> 00:57:19,743
The thing is, if you hire me,
the issue is, sir,

1226
00:57:19,743 --> 00:57:22,326
I'm not sure you and Penn State
are two entities

1227
00:57:22,326 --> 00:57:25,034
with aligned interests
right now.

1228
00:57:25,034 --> 00:57:28,451
Well, I never
thought of it that way.

1229
00:57:28,451 --> 00:57:31,577
Scott:
The guy just represents you,
so you've gotta pay for it?

1230
00:57:31,577 --> 00:57:33,368
When it's over,
they'll reimburse me.

1231
00:57:33,368 --> 00:57:34,785
Yeah, the university's
reputation

1232
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:36,493
is the board's
responsibility.

1233
00:57:36,493 --> 00:57:38,034
This is their crisis.

1234
00:57:38,034 --> 00:57:40,702
They need to hire
a crisis manager, not us.

1235
00:57:40,702 --> 00:57:42,577
- Yeah.
- ( singing in distance )

1236
00:57:42,577 --> 00:57:43,702
What the hell is that?

1237
00:57:48,451 --> 00:57:51,201
( singing continues )

1238
00:57:59,243 --> 00:58:01,326
( singing )

1239
00:58:01,326 --> 00:58:06,243
We're here for them.

What kind of bullshit was that?

1285
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:04,326
You know, football programs
make millions of dollars--

1286
01:00:04,326 --> 01:00:05,326
Billions.

1287
01:00:05,326 --> 01:00:06,326

But JoePa was the only one
who ever said,

1291
01:00:10,285 --> 01:00:11,702
you know, these are scholars,

1292
01:00:11,702 --> 01:00:13,535
they're here to learn
how to become men.

I have to believe
you know the difference

between a gay man
and a pedophile.

Are you calling me a faggot?

1298
01:00:22,868 --> 01:00:25,243
Whether or not you're a faggot
has nothing to do

1299
01:00:25,243 --> 01:00:27,076
with the act of a child abuser.

If you're friend calls me
a fuckin' faggot one more time,

I'm gonna lose my shit.

Who are you even talking to?

1303
01:00:32,368 --> 01:00:35,993
JoePa made an ethos
in this whole place.

1304
01:00:35,993 --> 01:00:38,909
Like, it fucking mattered
that you got an education

1305
01:00:38,909 --> 01:00:41,034
because you're about more
than just yourself.

1306
01:00:41,034 --> 01:00:43,577
You're a school,
and you fight
for something together.

Juliet: She went to the school.

Don't be afraid to lose.

1311

The team that makes
fewer mistakes wins.

1312
01:00:52,410 --> 01:00:54,076
Cut your hair, wear a tie--

1313
01:00:54,076 --> 01:00:56,951
- That's literally all JoePa.
- I think she knows that.

1314
01:00:56,951 --> 01:00:59,201
You know why you read Virgil
in the original?

1315

of coded language.

She doesn't have a good lie,
she doesn't get a good paycheck.

1321
01:01:15,535 --> 01:01:19,201
Well, it must not be

and some of it's people hearing

1328
01:02:19,076 --> 01:02:21,159
- and not believing it--
- ( knocking on door )

Yep.

1331
01:02:28,326 --> 01:02:30,159
We need to be on the phone
with Lanny Davis at four.

1332
01:02:30,159 --> 01:02:32,702
Bill Clinton's lawyer.
He's representing Penn State.

1333
01:02:32,702 --> 01:02:33,909
Holy shit.

1334
01:02:33,909 --> 01:02:35,326
He's gonna scream a lot,

1335
01:02:35,326 --> 01:02:37,368
and threaten to sue the paper
into the ground.

1336
01:02:37,368 --> 01:02:39,909
Can he do that?

1337
01:02:39,909 --> 01:02:43,076

- ( clears throat )

The cops. Gary Schultz.
He says he told Spanier,
Spanier said he didn't.

1339
01:02:48,118 --> 01:02:49,702
What's the likelihood
Schultz knew

1340
01:02:49,702 --> 01:02:51,743
and didn't tell
Tim Curley and JoePa?

1341
01:02:51,743 --> 01:02:53,243
Nobody take a shit
around there

1342
01:02:53,243 --> 01:02:55,326
without asking JoePa
for tactical advice, so--

1343
01:02:55,326 --> 01:02:56,326
But he says no.

1344
01:02:57,493 --> 01:02:59,326
The kid he raped
at the Alamo Bowl?

1345
01:02:59,326 --> 01:03:01,827
That was '99,
but I don't think
he told anybody...

1346
01:03:01,827 --> 01:03:04,368
- before the investigation.
- 2000?

1347
01:03:04,368 --> 01:03:08,577
A janitor sees Jerry
pin a boy to a wall, blow him,

1348
01:03:08,577 --> 01:03:11,951

who's scared shitless of Joe,

1349
01:03:11,951 --> 01:03:14,159
thinks he's gonna get fired,
so no report.

1350
01:03:14,159 --> 01:03:15,159
2001?

1351
01:03:15,159 --> 01:03:16,451
Well, 2001, everybody knew,

1352
01:03:16,451 --> 01:03:17,660
but they called it nothing.

1353
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:19,118
Horsing around
in a locker room.

1354
01:03:19,118 --> 01:03:20,410
Who? Who uses those words?

1355
01:03:20,410 --> 01:03:23,702
Spanier said he heard
it was conduct

1356
01:03:23,702 --> 01:03:26,326
that made somebody
uncomfortable. McQueary.

1357
01:03:26,326 --> 01:03:28,034
Wait, that's
what McQueary told him?

1358
01:03:28,034 --> 01:03:29,201
No, he never talked to McQueary.

1359
01:03:29,201 --> 01:03:30,243
Who met with McQueary?

1360
01:03:30,243 --> 01:03:31,618
Paterno, Schultz, Curley.

1361
01:03:31,618 --> 01:03:33,034
How do they describe it?

1362
01:03:33,034 --> 01:03:35,285
They described it as
"inappropriate conduct,

1363
01:03:35,285 --> 01:03:37,034
horsing around,
not that serious."

1364
01:03:37,034 --> 01:03:38,535
And what about JoePa?

1365
01:03:38,535 --> 01:03:41,743
He said that McQueary saw
something of a sexual nature.

1366
01:03:43,243 --> 01:03:44,951
What does Joe consider sexual?

1367
01:03:44,951 --> 01:03:46,285
I don't know.

1368
01:03:46,285 --> 01:03:47,951
What did McQueary say?

1369
01:03:47,951 --> 01:03:49,201
McQueary said what he saw.

1370
01:03:49,201 --> 01:03:50,451
The kid against the wall,
Jerry behind him,

1371
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:51,743
rhythmic sounds.

1372
01:03:51,743 --> 01:03:53,159
Anal rape.

1373
01:03:53,159 --> 01:03:55,243
Probably, but I don't know
if he said those words.

1374
01:03:55,243 --> 01:03:58,201
He was trying
to communicate anal rape,
not snapping towels.

1375
01:03:58,201 --> 01:03:59,743
Well, I know that--
I just don't know

1376
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:01,410
if we're on solid ground
to say that.

1377
01:04:01,410 --> 01:04:03,076
I don't know if he said
that to Joe.

1378
01:04:03,076 --> 01:04:04,702
Are we having
a role reversal here?

1379
01:04:04,702 --> 01:04:06,827
You choose your words,
you choose your reality.

1380
01:04:06,827 --> 01:04:09,201
How many people used words
that allowed other people

1381
01:04:09,201 --> 01:04:11,535
to understand crimes
against children

1382
01:04:11,535 --> 01:04:14,076
as what knuckleheads
do in locker rooms?

1383
01:04:14,076 --> 01:04:15,410
We're in this, too.

1384
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:16,660
You're first article's
the reason

1385
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:17,951
a bunch of these victims
came forward.

1386
01:04:17,951 --> 01:04:19,535
There's no case
without that.

1387
01:04:19,535 --> 01:04:20,577
You think I don't wanna use

1388
01:04:20,577 --> 01:04:22,076
the strongest possible language?

1389
01:04:22,076 --> 01:04:23,577
But when Bill Clinton's
lawyer calls you--

1390
01:04:23,577 --> 01:04:24,535
I'll deal with that.

1391
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:33,785
Scott: He is the soul
of the university.

1392
01:04:33,785 --> 01:04:35,451
Anybody in this town
will tell you that.

1393
01:04:35,451 --> 01:04:39,577
Sue: We built the library,
and he quintupled the endowment.

1394
01:04:39,577 --> 01:04:42,410
- Mary Kay: $2 billion.
- This was a cow college.

1395
01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:44,909
Sue: They wanted a school
with a good football team.

1396
01:04:44,909 --> 01:04:46,577
But Joe always said
that they should be

1397
01:04:46,577 --> 01:04:48,660
a world-class
academic institution.

1398
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:50,451
It's not a farm team
for the NFL.

1399
01:04:50,451 --> 01:04:52,785
Scott: It's a, uh--
it's a philosophy.

1400
01:04:52,785 --> 01:04:53,951
Mary Kay:
Like the dorms.

1401
01:04:53,951 --> 01:04:55,034
Would not allow...

1402
01:04:55,034 --> 01:04:57,577
an athletic dormitory...

1403
01:04:57,577 --> 01:04:58,618
( audio trails off )

1404
01:05:06,159 --> 01:05:08,076
( cheering )

1405
01:05:08,076 --> 01:05:11,243
Show him the "Why I hate
Jerry Sandusky" memo.

1406
01:05:12,702 --> 01:05:15,034
I don't know...

1407
01:05:15,034 --> 01:05:16,159
what this is.

1408
01:05:20,285 --> 01:05:21,326
What do you think?

1409
01:05:26,993 --> 01:05:30,951
Scott: If there was
a reason to fire Jerry,
he would have found it.

1410
01:05:30,951 --> 01:05:34,660
Okay, stop talking
about me like I'm dead, please.

1411
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:37,827
I'm here.
The press is here.

1412
01:05:37,827 --> 01:05:40,034
Kids are shouting on the lawn.

1413
01:05:40,034 --> 01:05:43,368
Everybody wants to know
what I have to say.

1414
01:05:43,368 --> 01:05:45,118
So, it's time to say it.

1415
01:05:46,868 --> 01:05:49,493
And what exactly
do you want them to know?

1416
01:05:49,493 --> 01:05:53,410
Uh, a tragedy happened.

1417
01:05:53,410 --> 01:05:56,827
I did exactly
what I was supposed to do

1418
01:05:56,827 --> 01:05:58,577
as soon as I knew.

1419
01:05:58,577 --> 01:06:00,243
End of story.

1420
01:06:00,243 --> 01:06:04,243
Did other people know?
I don't know.

1421
01:06:04,243 --> 01:06:06,577
Did I know about rumors?

1422
01:06:06,577 --> 01:06:08,326
Who remembers?

1423
01:06:08,326 --> 01:06:10,493
I don't know
what I had for breakfast.

1424
01:06:10,493 --> 01:06:12,243
( scoffs )

1425
01:06:12,243 --> 01:06:14,034
Sir, uh--

1426
01:06:14,034 --> 01:06:19,159
Point is, it's time to focus
on helping the university,

1427
01:06:19,159 --> 01:06:22,493
not talking about Joe Paterno.

1428
01:06:22,493 --> 01:06:24,827
It's-- What do--

1429
01:06:24,827 --> 01:06:28,493
It's got nothing
to do with me, truly.

1430
01:06:28,493 --> 01:06:31,034
What does it have to do with me?

1431
01:06:31,034 --> 01:06:33,493
McGinn: Coach, I have
so much respect
for you.

1432
01:06:33,493 --> 01:06:34,951
( Paterno grunts )

1433
01:06:34,951 --> 01:06:36,743
I followed your career
for a long time.

1434
01:06:36,743 --> 01:06:39,618
That's why I took the case.

1435
01:06:39,618 --> 01:06:41,577
This is the bad part
of my job.

1436
01:06:45,118 --> 01:06:46,743
You need to step down.

1437
01:06:48,159 --> 01:06:50,076
- You need to retire...
- Scott: Whoa.

1438
01:06:50,076 --> 01:06:52,660
and announce it
right away.

1439
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:56,034
Scott: Okay, wait, wait--
Hold on--

1440
01:06:56,034 --> 01:06:59,076
I want to know, from you,

1441
01:06:59,076 --> 01:07:01,868
what not to say to the press.

1442
01:07:01,868 --> 01:07:03,909
That's why you're here.

1443
01:07:03,909 --> 01:07:06,577
I don't need career advice.

1444
01:07:06,577 --> 01:07:08,118
Scott: Dan,
we asked you to craft

1445
01:07:08,118 --> 01:07:09,660
a message
for the press.
That's it.

1446
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:11,577
This isn't
about what he--

1447
01:07:11,577 --> 01:07:15,993
No. He can't go
out there.

1448
01:07:15,993 --> 01:07:17,909
He's used to being
the emperor holding forth

1449
01:07:17,909 --> 01:07:21,243
in front of a press corps
that just watched him win.

1450
01:07:21,243 --> 01:07:23,368
You're not disciplined enough
to go before the press.

1451
01:07:23,368 --> 01:07:25,034
- That's not true.
- Sue: Hey, he talks
in front of the press

1452
01:07:25,034 --> 01:07:26,785
every day, Mr. McGinn.

1453
01:07:26,785 --> 01:07:28,743
Ma'am, "What I had
for breakfast"
is what people say

1454
01:07:28,743 --> 01:07:30,868
when they're worried
that they do  know,

1455
01:07:30,868 --> 01:07:35,577
and they're old enough
to think that they'll
get away with it.

1456
01:07:35,577 --> 01:07:37,951
I started saying it
to my wife when I turned 40.

1457
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:42,660
You need to resign
before somebody does it
for you.

1458
01:07:45,868 --> 01:07:47,785
You've had
a great career.

1459
01:07:47,785 --> 01:07:49,410
Spanier: I'm gonna
recommend to the board

1460
01:07:49,410 --> 01:07:51,827
that 2005 be your last season.

1461
01:07:54,618 --> 01:07:57,618
McGinn:
How old are you, sir?

1462
01:07:57,618 --> 01:08:00,201
Sue: He's 84.

1463
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:01,618
Paterno:
I may be 77,

1464
01:08:01,618 --> 01:08:03,951
- but I'm not old.
- Joe.

1465
01:08:03,951 --> 01:08:06,660
I've raised millions of dollars
for this university.

1466
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:09,827
I graduate 85% of my players.

1467
01:08:09,827 --> 01:08:13,951
You wanna fire me...

1468
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:15,660
try it.

1469
01:08:18,159 --> 01:08:20,618
McGinn:
Folks...

1470
01:08:20,618 --> 01:08:22,326
the question of whether...

1471
01:08:22,326 --> 01:08:25,326
Coach Paterno will retire
or be fired

1472
01:08:25,326 --> 01:08:27,827
is a big part of the public
narrative right now.

1473
01:08:27,827 --> 01:08:30,368
I want you all
to think about that.

1474
01:08:30,368 --> 01:08:33,326
( indistinct voices
in background )

1475
01:08:39,118 --> 01:08:40,368
You've had a great career.

1476
01:08:44,034 --> 01:08:47,201
Coach? A great career.

1477
01:08:56,243 --> 01:08:58,827
Man:
I'm very disappointed in JoePa.

1478
01:08:58,827 --> 01:09:01,827
To be honest with ya,
I've looked up to him
my whole life.

1479
01:09:01,827 --> 01:09:05,535
Why would he stick up
for a frickin' pedophile?

1480
01:09:05,535 --> 01:09:09,368
Why would this happen?
Help me with this.

1481
01:09:15,368 --> 01:09:17,034
Man:
Let's go, let's go, lets go!

1482
01:09:20,451 --> 01:09:25,285
Paterno:
Did I see a reverse throwback
to the quarterback?

1483
01:09:25,285 --> 01:09:27,909
Bone Right over 42.
Pitch reverse pass.

1484
01:09:29,535 --> 01:09:33,660
Well, don't practice it
unless you're gonna use it.

1485
01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:35,577
We'll use it.

1486
01:09:35,577 --> 01:09:36,410
Yeah.

1487
01:09:40,451 --> 01:09:41,451
So...

1488
01:09:43,993 --> 01:09:45,951
Uh, look, guys, uh...

1489
01:09:47,618 --> 01:09:49,535
Th-- This thing, uh...

1490
01:09:49,535 --> 01:09:52,410
is-- is-- is-- gotten, um...

1491
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:55,951
you know, out of hand. So...

1492
01:09:57,909 --> 01:10:01,243
I-- I planned to, uh,

1493
01:10:01,243 --> 01:10:04,577
pack it in,
end of they year, anyway.

1494
01:10:04,577 --> 01:10:06,827
So...

1495
01:10:11,909 --> 01:10:13,868
Guido:
I am absolutely devastated

1496
01:10:13,868 --> 01:10:16,118
by the developments
in this case.

1497
01:10:16,118 --> 01:10:19,618
I grieve for the children
and their families,

1498
01:10:19,618 --> 01:10:22,285
and I pray
for their comfort
and relief.

1499
01:10:22,285 --> 01:10:25,451
I have come to work every day
for the last 61 years

1500
01:10:25,451 --> 01:10:27,410
with one clear goal in mind:

1501
01:10:27,410 --> 01:10:30,118
to serve the best interests
of this university

1502
01:10:30,118 --> 01:10:34,827
and the young men who have been
entrusted to my care.

1503
01:10:34,827 --> 01:10:37,577
I have the same goal today.

1504
01:10:37,577 --> 01:10:40,118
That's why I've decided
to announce my retirement,

1505
01:10:40,118 --> 01:10:43,535
effective at the end
of this season.

1506
01:10:43,535 --> 01:10:46,410
I love you all, guys,
I really do.

1507
01:10:46,410 --> 01:10:48,951
I want you to know
that we're gonna play

1508
01:10:48,951 --> 01:10:51,451
the rest of the season
together, awright?

1509
01:10:51,451 --> 01:10:53,368
That's the deal.

1510
01:10:53,368 --> 01:10:54,951
That's the new deal.

1511
01:10:54,951 --> 01:10:58,159
There's still a lot
of football to play.

1512
01:10:58,159 --> 01:11:02,827
A lot of interesting things
can happen to all of you.

1513
01:11:02,827 --> 01:11:08,535
I want that for you.
So, I want you to focus on that.

1514
01:11:08,535 --> 01:11:11,909
'Cause that's all
there really is, what we do.

1515
01:11:11,909 --> 01:11:15,076
The rest of this
is just something--

1516
01:11:15,076 --> 01:11:17,993
I mean, what happened
this last week...

1517
01:11:19,535 --> 01:11:20,993
is just--

1518
01:11:23,993 --> 01:11:28,118
It's not your fault.
You had nothin' to do with it.

1519
01:11:29,743 --> 01:11:33,243
But it--
It makes me feel bad...

1520
01:11:33,243 --> 01:11:36,577
that you, uh,
had to put up with it.

1521
01:11:38,993 --> 01:11:42,410
We'll always be
Penn State football players.

1522
01:11:42,410 --> 01:11:44,368
- All: Yes, sir.
- Yep.

1523
01:11:44,368 --> 01:11:49,243
Always, till the day we die...

1524
01:11:52,243 --> 01:11:56,410
Paterno:
I wish I could've
done more for those kids.

1525
01:11:56,410 --> 01:11:58,326
Can't say that.

1526
01:11:58,326 --> 01:12:00,201
It's an admission of guilt.

1527
01:12:02,368 --> 01:12:05,743
Well, is there any human person
looking at this

1528
01:12:05,743 --> 01:12:09,118
doesn't wish they could've
done something more?

1529
01:12:09,118 --> 01:12:11,034
You're gonna be misquoted.

1530
01:12:13,243 --> 01:12:14,785
I'm gonna be gone.

1531
01:12:25,410 --> 01:12:27,243
- ( phone ringing )
- Dawn?

1532
01:12:27,243 --> 01:12:28,702
- Hi.
- Hi.

1533
01:12:28,702 --> 01:12:30,618
I'm so sorry.
Aaron tried to call me,

1534
01:12:30,618 --> 01:12:32,243
and I-- I was right--

1535
01:12:32,243 --> 01:12:38,243
I-- I know. There was, um,
a problem at school, and--

1536
01:12:38,243 --> 01:12:40,743
We're not talking
to any other reporters.

1537
01:12:40,743 --> 01:12:46,743
They all want to, but...
we said no to everyone but you.

1538
01:12:46,743 --> 01:12:48,451
You get that, right?

1539
01:12:48,451 --> 01:12:49,909
I-- I know. I know,

1540
01:12:49,909 --> 01:12:53,285
and I cannot tell you
how much I appreciate that.

1541
01:12:53,285 --> 01:12:57,410
Do you wanna talk to Mike,
Aaron's psychologist?

1542
01:12:57,410 --> 01:12:59,951
I mean, yeah.
That would be great.

1543
01:12:59,951 --> 01:13:01,577
Would Aaron be okay with that?

1544
01:13:01,577 --> 01:13:03,118
I'm driving down there tonight

1545
01:13:03,118 --> 01:13:05,951
and I could meet
with him tomorrow.

1546
01:13:05,951 --> 01:13:09,618
Dawn:
Yeah. Aaron says it's okay.

1547
01:13:09,618 --> 01:13:13,410
Woman:
Penn State football coach
Joe Paterno will retire,

1548
01:13:13,410 --> 01:13:16,118
but tonight
everyone is taking sides
on what he asked

1549
01:13:16,118 --> 01:13:19,410
in return to coach
four more games.

1550
01:13:19,410 --> 01:13:21,285
The poll conducted
on ESPN suggested

1551
01:13:21,285 --> 01:13:23,868
that 61% of the people
out there

1552
01:13:23,868 --> 01:13:26,118
think he should be allowed
that opportunity.

1553
01:13:26,118 --> 01:13:28,285
If you ask people
who are not sports fans,

1554
01:13:28,285 --> 01:13:30,660
you might get
a very different result.

1555
01:13:31,785 --> 01:13:32,660
Sue: Joe?

1556
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:36,702
- Come on, Joe.
- Yeah.

1557
01:13:36,702 --> 01:13:38,743
Come on, hon.
Let's go to bed.

1558
01:13:38,743 --> 01:13:40,660
- I, uh--
- Yeah?

1559
01:13:40,660 --> 01:13:42,285
Yes, I'm still home.

1560
01:13:42,285 --> 01:13:44,201
Yeah, that's enough work
for one day.

1561
01:13:44,201 --> 01:13:46,201
Come on, let's go.

1562
01:13:46,201 --> 01:13:48,159
( groans )

1563
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:52,076
I think--
hip is acting up again.

1564
01:13:52,076 --> 01:13:53,951
- Oh, it is?
- Yeah. See that?

1565
01:13:53,951 --> 01:13:57,243
- Oh, man.
- Oh, yeah. I'll give you a rub.

1566
01:13:57,243 --> 01:13:59,993
They say that's the--
that's the good--

1567
01:13:59,993 --> 01:14:02,034
the best operation
you can get.

1568
01:14:02,034 --> 01:14:03,201
A rub?

1569
01:14:03,201 --> 01:14:05,827
No, a hip op--
replacement, yeah.

1570
01:14:05,827 --> 01:14:07,326
- ( doorbell )
- You're not there yet.

1571
01:14:07,326 --> 01:14:09,118
- Oh, what's that?
- What is that?

1572
01:14:09,118 --> 01:14:10,785
I don't know.

1573
01:14:10,785 --> 01:14:12,285
I'll get--
I'll get it.

1574
01:14:12,285 --> 01:14:14,034
Okay.

1575
01:14:14,034 --> 01:14:16,326
- Who callin' at this time?
- I don't know.

1576
01:14:17,868 --> 01:14:19,451
- Yeah?
- Hey, Joe.

1577
01:14:19,451 --> 01:14:21,660
- Hey, Frank.
- Sorry to come here so late.

1578
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:24,577
- That's all right.
- This is for you.

1579
01:14:26,743 --> 01:14:29,868
They'd, uh--
they'd like you
to call him.

1580
01:14:29,868 --> 01:14:31,868
Call him?

1581
01:14:31,868 --> 01:14:34,493
Oh. Yeah, thank you.

1582
01:14:39,660 --> 01:14:43,034
Well, the board
of trustees is holding
an emergency meeting

1583
01:14:43,034 --> 01:14:45,410
and there's a lot
of speculation here
on the future

1584
01:14:45,410 --> 01:14:47,368
of university president
Graham Spanier.

1585
01:14:47,368 --> 01:14:50,243
Will he resign?

1586
01:14:50,243 --> 01:14:53,368
Will the board ask him
to step down?

1587
01:14:53,368 --> 01:14:55,159
( touchtones beeping )

1588
01:15:01,951 --> 01:15:04,118
Yeah, it's Joe Paterno.

1589
01:15:13,118 --> 01:15:14,201
What?

1590
01:15:15,743 --> 01:15:16,743
They fired me.

1591
01:15:18,702 --> 01:15:19,785
What?

1592
01:15:19,785 --> 01:15:22,285
Yeah,
effective immediately.

1593
01:15:24,368 --> 01:15:25,660
- Joe.
- Yeah.

1594
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:27,909
Joe, give me
that phone.

1595
01:15:27,909 --> 01:15:29,034
Let me have
that phone.

1596
01:15:30,577 --> 01:15:32,243
( dialing )

1597
01:15:35,909 --> 01:15:38,201
- ( line out ringing )
- Man: Hello?

1598
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:42,785
After 61 years,
he deserved better.

1599
01:15:42,785 --> 01:15:43,827
( beep )

1600
01:15:53,285 --> 01:15:54,618
( sighs )

1601
01:15:57,285 --> 01:15:58,577
( indistinct chatter )

1602
01:15:58,577 --> 01:16:01,201
Man: ...the indictment
of Jerry Sandusky,

1603
01:16:01,201 --> 01:16:02,743
the board...

1604
01:16:02,743 --> 01:16:04,535
Newhouse ( over phone ):
Hey, listen.

1605
01:16:04,535 --> 01:16:06,618
Man on TV: ...Penn State's board
of trustees, tonight,

1606
01:16:06,618 --> 01:16:11,410
decided that it is
in the best interests
of the university

1607
01:16:11,410 --> 01:16:13,993
to have a change
in leadership to deal

1608
01:16:13,993 --> 01:16:18,118
with the difficult issues
that we are facing.

1609
01:16:18,118 --> 01:16:21,118
The board of trustees
and Graham Spanier
have decided that,

1610
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:27,034
effective immediately,
Dr. Spanier is no longer
president of the university.

1611
01:16:28,868 --> 01:16:31,785
In addition,
Joe Paterno is no longer

1612
01:16:31,785 --> 01:16:33,493
the head football coach.

1613
01:16:33,493 --> 01:16:34,993
What?

1614
01:16:34,993 --> 01:16:36,785
( all shouting )

1615
01:16:40,410 --> 01:16:42,326
( shouting continues )

1616
01:16:42,326 --> 01:16:44,285
Man:
Take that motherfucker down!

1617
01:16:44,285 --> 01:16:46,159
Joe Paterno is  Penn State!

1618
01:16:52,451 --> 01:16:54,660
( excited chatter )

1619
01:16:58,243 --> 01:17:00,577
They fired him
with a phone call.

1620
01:17:00,577 --> 01:17:03,577
After 45 years, You know,
who the hell does that?

1621
01:17:06,201 --> 01:17:07,827
Student: He didn't give a shit
about winning.

1622
01:17:07,827 --> 01:17:09,535
Student 2:
He fuckin' won anyway.

1623
01:17:09,535 --> 01:17:11,201
It's a motherfuckin'
travesty.

1624
01:17:11,201 --> 01:17:12,660
Get off his fuckin' lawn.

1625
01:17:12,660 --> 01:17:16,118
Students chanting:
We want Joe! We want Joe!

1626
01:17:16,118 --> 01:17:20,118
( chanting ) We want Joe!
We want Joe! We want Joe!

1627
01:17:20,118 --> 01:17:23,076
( chanting continues )

1628
01:17:23,076 --> 01:17:25,368
( all cheering )

1629
01:17:28,326 --> 01:17:30,326
- ( chanting ) Joe Paterno!
- ( rhythmic clapping )

1630
01:17:30,326 --> 01:17:32,410
You're great, you guys.

1631
01:17:32,410 --> 01:17:37,368
You guys are great.
And-- And let me tell you this:

1632
01:17:37,368 --> 01:17:41,868
You know what I say, guys--
you know, I mean girls too--

1633
01:17:41,868 --> 01:17:45,410
- We love you, Joe!
- ( cheering )

1634
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:50,993
Listen. You gotta-- You gotta--
You gotta study now, all right?

1635
01:17:50,993 --> 01:17:52,785
( angry shouting )

1636
01:17:52,785 --> 01:17:57,201
You gotta get
a good night's sleep
so you can study.

1637
01:17:57,201 --> 01:17:58,702
We still got things to do.

1638
01:18:01,577 --> 01:18:04,326
I'm out of it now, maybe,

1639
01:18:04,326 --> 01:18:06,076
that phone call put me
out of it,

1640
01:18:06,076 --> 01:18:08,909
but we're gonna go
from here, okay?

1641
01:18:08,909 --> 01:18:10,993
We're gonna go from here.

1642
01:18:10,993 --> 01:18:13,577
You know, because things
have ways--

1643
01:18:13,577 --> 01:18:14,909
they have ways of working out.

1644
01:18:14,909 --> 01:18:17,159
We want Joe! One more day!

1645
01:18:17,159 --> 01:18:19,243
We don't know
what's gonna happen ever.

1646
01:18:19,243 --> 01:18:20,868
Right? And the same with you.

1647
01:18:20,868 --> 01:18:22,410
So, take care
of yourselves.

1648
01:18:22,410 --> 01:18:23,868
It's important you do that.

1649
01:18:23,868 --> 01:18:27,702
Right? All right.
You're gonna be fine.

1650
01:18:27,702 --> 01:18:31,076
- ( all clamoring )
- Oh-- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1651
01:18:31,076 --> 01:18:33,868
Good luck to you all,
but listen to me
just a second.

1652
01:18:33,868 --> 01:18:35,410
I thank you for coming.

1653
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:40,618
Pray a little bit for the--
for those victims, okay?

1654
01:18:40,618 --> 01:18:42,451
We'll do that. Okay.

1655
01:18:42,451 --> 01:18:45,034
- Joe! Joe!
- We love you!

1656
01:18:45,034 --> 01:18:46,909
( chanting )
We are Penn State!
We are Penn State!

1657
01:18:46,909 --> 01:18:48,368
That's right!

1658
01:18:48,368 --> 01:18:49,909
( chanting continues )

1659
01:18:49,909 --> 01:18:51,785
We are Penn State!

1660
01:19:00,493 --> 01:19:02,951
( siren wails in distance )

1661
01:19:04,785 --> 01:19:07,993
We want Joe! We want Joe!
We want Joe!

1662
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:09,993
( all chanting )

1663
01:19:09,993 --> 01:19:12,410
Excuse me!
Can I ask you any questions?!

1664
01:19:12,410 --> 01:19:15,827
All:
We want Joe! We want Joe!
We want Joe!

1665
01:19:15,827 --> 01:19:18,076
What did you think
about happened to JoePa?

1666
01:19:18,076 --> 01:19:20,951
Kids got abused
and he didn't
tell the police.

1667
01:19:20,951 --> 01:19:22,201
You go to jail
for that.

1668
01:19:22,201 --> 01:19:23,951
- Let's go!
- Can I, can I--

1669
01:19:23,951 --> 01:19:25,660
Can I maybe quote you
on that?

1670
01:19:25,660 --> 01:19:28,493
No! I don't want
to get fucking killed
in my bed!

1671
01:19:32,451 --> 01:19:35,326
( crowd roaring )

1672
01:19:35,326 --> 01:19:37,660
( siren wailing )

1673
01:19:43,034 --> 01:19:45,577
Young man:
The vice president
of the school

1674
01:19:45,577 --> 01:19:47,577
knew about it in 1998.

1675
01:19:47,577 --> 01:19:48,993
Heard about it twice.

1676
01:19:48,993 --> 01:19:51,577
You hear it twice
and you don't hang the guy,

1677
01:19:51,577 --> 01:19:52,743
you're just an (bleep)hole.

1678
01:19:52,743 --> 01:19:55,076
Joe heard about it in 2001.

1679
01:19:55,076 --> 01:19:57,702
He reported it immediately.

1680
01:19:57,702 --> 01:20:00,868
But we're definitely
telling Second Mile,
right?

1681
01:20:00,868 --> 01:20:02,702
Curley:
Uh, yeah.

1682
01:20:02,702 --> 01:20:04,535
And-- and the Child Welfare
thing,

1683
01:20:04,535 --> 01:20:07,243
we're just playing it by ear,
and Graham's okay with that?

1684
01:20:07,243 --> 01:20:11,660
Well, Graham says the only
downside is if Jerry doesn't
get it and this happens again.

1685
01:20:11,660 --> 01:20:15,285
Then we're vulnerable
for not having reported it.

1686
01:20:15,285 --> 01:20:17,368
But we can deal with that
down the road.

1687
01:20:17,368 --> 01:20:18,993
Joe's fine with that.

1688
01:20:18,993 --> 01:20:20,702
- Paterno?
- Yeah.

1689
01:20:20,702 --> 01:20:22,535
But he doesn't know
about the last time,

1690
01:20:22,535 --> 01:20:24,118
the thing from '98.

1691
01:20:24,118 --> 01:20:26,034
Yeah, of course he knows.

1692
01:20:26,034 --> 01:20:27,034
I sat down with him
when it happened.

1693
01:20:27,034 --> 01:20:28,618
He was all over me about it.

1694
01:20:28,618 --> 01:20:30,076
You sat down with him

1695
01:20:30,076 --> 01:20:31,410
when it happened?

1696
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:33,076
He wanted
constant updates.

1697
01:20:33,076 --> 01:20:35,076
You ever keep Paterno
waiting on anything?

1698
01:20:35,076 --> 01:20:36,410
He's like a woodpecker.

1699
01:20:36,410 --> 01:20:37,451
( chanting )
We want Joe!

1700
01:20:37,451 --> 01:20:39,493
We want Joe! We want Joe!

1701
01:20:39,493 --> 01:20:41,702
( chanting continues )

1702
01:20:41,702 --> 01:20:44,909
Schultz: Tim, if Joe knows
this is the second incident--

1703
01:20:44,909 --> 01:20:46,577
And you're sure?

1704
01:20:46,577 --> 01:20:48,159
Curley: Look, I've--
I've got emails

1705
01:20:48,159 --> 01:20:50,577
up one side
and down the other. Yes.

1706
01:20:50,577 --> 01:20:53,201
( sighs )
I don't know.

1707
01:20:53,201 --> 01:20:56,743
Gary. If we need to report it,
we'll report it.

1708
01:20:56,743 --> 01:20:58,577
But we start with sitting down

1709
01:20:58,577 --> 01:21:01,034
and talking to Jerry
like a person.

1710
01:21:01,034 --> 01:21:02,326
Joe's fine with that.

1711
01:21:02,326 --> 01:21:06,827
- Okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, fine.

1712
01:21:06,827 --> 01:21:09,577
Sit tight, and this is
gonna get taken care of.

1713
01:21:18,493 --> 01:21:19,785
Man 1:
What do they do first?

1714
01:21:19,785 --> 01:21:21,993
They protect themselves first,

1715
01:21:21,993 --> 01:21:23,577
try to sweep it under the rug.

1716
01:21:23,577 --> 01:21:24,909
That's one thing
the Catholic Church

1717
01:21:24,909 --> 01:21:26,285
and Penn State have in common.

1718
01:21:26,285 --> 01:21:27,451
Man 2:
Joe's not the one who should be

1719
01:21:27,451 --> 01:21:29,159
taking the fall for this.

1720
01:21:29,159 --> 01:21:31,118
It's fuckin' Jerry.
Get the fuck off JoePa.

1721
01:21:31,118 --> 01:21:32,785
Man 3: It's the media
who singled out Joe Paterno.

1722
01:21:32,785 --> 01:21:34,785
They made him look
like a fuckin' villain!

1723
01:21:34,785 --> 01:21:38,493
You call him a legend,
then treat him like a legend.

1724
01:21:38,493 --> 01:21:40,285
Man 4:
Here's a man that was told

1725
01:21:40,285 --> 01:21:43,785
that a ten-year-old boy
was being sodomized

1726
01:21:43,785 --> 01:21:47,159
in his backyard,
and did nothing about it.

1727
01:21:47,159 --> 01:21:49,451
Woman: He has done so much
for this university,

1728
01:21:49,451 --> 01:21:51,034
and within the past four days,

1729
01:21:51,034 --> 01:21:52,785
everything we knew
of Joe Paterno

1730
01:21:52,785 --> 01:21:55,326
has been ripped away from us--

1731
01:21:55,326 --> 01:21:57,702
Man 4: And rightfully so!
He's as much of an animal
as the guy that did the act.

1732
01:21:57,702 --> 01:22:00,827
Man 5: Are you kidding me?
How stupid do you have to be

1733
01:22:00,827 --> 01:22:03,827
to go ahead and protest
over taking down

1734
01:22:03,827 --> 01:22:05,660
a ring of child abusers?!

1735
01:22:05,660 --> 01:22:07,159
Are you serious?!

1736
01:22:07,159 --> 01:22:08,660
Man 6:
Two years ago, we had no idea

1737
01:22:08,660 --> 01:22:09,909
and it was
a great football program.

1738
01:22:09,909 --> 01:22:11,493
Man 7:
Yeah, a few years ago,

1739
01:22:11,493 --> 01:22:13,410
you had several kids
getting raped.

1740
01:22:13,410 --> 01:22:14,993
Man 8: You guys have been
brainwashed by that school.

1741
01:22:14,993 --> 01:22:16,535
It's nothing but a cult--

1742
01:22:16,535 --> 01:22:19,451
Man 9: This has football
written all over it!

1743
01:22:19,451 --> 01:22:21,034
Man 10: He did exactly
the right thing.

1744
01:22:21,034 --> 01:22:22,535
If he had done any more,

1745
01:22:22,535 --> 01:22:24,785
he would have been criticized
for that...

1746
01:22:24,785 --> 01:22:27,326
- ( overlapping newscasts )
- ( students chanting )

1747
01:22:27,326 --> 01:22:30,159
( chanting )
Fuck the media!

1748
01:22:30,159 --> 01:22:32,410
Fuck the media!

1749
01:22:32,410 --> 01:22:34,951
Fuck the media!

1750
01:22:34,951 --> 01:22:37,410
Fuck the media!

1751
01:22:37,410 --> 01:22:39,410
Fuck the media!

1752
01:22:39,410 --> 01:22:41,076
Fuck the media!

1753
01:22:41,076 --> 01:22:43,285
( chanting )
We want Joe! We want Joe!

1754
01:22:43,285 --> 01:22:45,535
We want Joe!
We want Joe!

1755
01:22:45,535 --> 01:22:47,702
We want Joe! We want Joe!

1756
01:22:47,702 --> 01:22:49,702
( chanting continues )

1757
01:22:55,618 --> 01:22:58,660
Man:
Good morning to you.
It was really a wild night.

1758
01:22:58,660 --> 01:23:02,368
It all started after students
here learned that
Joe Paterno had been fired.

1759
01:23:02,368 --> 01:23:04,076
Man 2:
I think it was a witch hunt,

1760
01:23:04,076 --> 01:23:05,493
and everybody
got what they wanted.

1761
01:23:05,493 --> 01:23:07,243
Woman:
Back in 1998,

1762
01:23:07,243 --> 01:23:09,535
this should've
and could've stopped.

1763
01:23:09,535 --> 01:23:11,660
Man 3: It almost makes
Paterno look like a fraud

1764
01:23:11,660 --> 01:23:13,618
for everything
he always stood for.

1765
01:23:13,618 --> 01:23:15,368
Woman: And that's what he
has now opened himself up for

1766
01:23:15,368 --> 01:23:18,451
because he always
had the moral superiority.

1767
01:23:18,451 --> 01:23:19,618
Man:
Right.

1768
01:23:19,618 --> 01:23:21,368
( indistinct chatter )

1769
01:23:21,368 --> 01:23:24,159
Hey guys, guys,
can you just back off the car?

1770
01:23:24,159 --> 01:23:26,076
Jay, one question:
Was your father fired

1771
01:23:26,076 --> 01:23:28,410
because he didn't
tell the grand jury
everything he knew?

1772
01:23:28,410 --> 01:23:31,076
No, I don't-- we don't
have an answer for--

1773
01:23:31,076 --> 01:23:33,660
- Woman: ...Victim Six
in your locker room...
- Yes, OK, take--

1774
01:23:33,660 --> 01:23:35,410
Guys. Guys!
Will you,

1775
01:23:35,410 --> 01:23:36,827
out of respect
for the children--

1776
01:23:36,827 --> 01:23:38,118
That's why we're here:
the kids.

1777
01:23:38,118 --> 01:23:39,201
No, I--

1778
01:23:39,201 --> 01:23:40,493
All right,
your kids.

1779
01:23:40,493 --> 01:23:43,285
Sorry. Didn't see
them there. Sorry.

1780
01:23:43,285 --> 01:23:44,451
Thanks, man.

1781
01:23:46,785 --> 01:23:48,743
Okay. Okay, guys. Come on.

1782
01:23:48,743 --> 01:23:52,243
Just go straight up to see
Grandpa, all right? Come on.

1783
01:23:56,368 --> 01:23:58,368
Just go straight up.
Straight up.

1784
01:24:02,993 --> 01:24:04,451
Jay:
I'm gonna get canned.

1785
01:24:04,451 --> 01:24:07,410
Bradley wants me
to come talk to him.

1786
01:24:07,410 --> 01:24:10,951
I don't think
they're gonna fire you.

1787
01:24:10,951 --> 01:24:12,785
Why?

1788
01:24:12,785 --> 01:24:15,493
( chuckles )
It's a witch hunt.

1789
01:24:15,493 --> 01:24:19,827
If they go for you,
there's no reason
they won't go for me.

1790
01:24:22,034 --> 01:24:25,285
The board of trustees wants
to make this all about us.

1791
01:24:25,285 --> 01:24:27,785
And football.
'Cause if they don't,

1792
01:24:27,785 --> 01:24:29,577
it'd have to be
about Second Mile,

1793
01:24:29,577 --> 01:24:30,827
where the guy
actually worked.

1794
01:24:34,201 --> 01:24:36,493
So who's gonna be
left holding the bag

1795
01:24:36,493 --> 01:24:38,326
if they can't blame it on us?

1796
01:24:40,410 --> 01:24:42,201
Oh, I don't know, ya know?

1797
01:24:46,577 --> 01:24:50,159
Dad, what exactly
did you...say?

1798
01:24:51,660 --> 01:24:53,951
McQueary came to me,

1799
01:24:53,951 --> 01:24:57,034
and he told me what he told me.

1800
01:24:57,034 --> 01:25:02,159
First time I ever
heard anything...like this.

1801
01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:04,618
So...

1802
01:25:04,618 --> 01:25:07,493
I knew I couldn't
handle it, so I went--

1803
01:25:09,493 --> 01:25:11,076
I mean, what am I gonna do?

1804
01:25:11,076 --> 01:25:15,493
Go runnin' with some things
I-- I don't know are true?

1805
01:25:17,118 --> 01:25:19,702
So I went to Tim...

1806
01:25:19,702 --> 01:25:21,368
and Gary.

1807
01:25:21,368 --> 01:25:24,285
( sighs )
Why them?

1808
01:25:24,285 --> 01:25:28,201
I didn't see it, Jay.

1809
01:25:28,201 --> 01:25:31,034
I didn't see it.

1810
01:25:31,034 --> 01:25:35,159
Tim and Gary are all right,
I mean, they--

1811
01:25:35,159 --> 01:25:37,868
Ya know? Capable people.

1812
01:25:41,493 --> 01:25:44,535
You know, the best thing
about this job...

1813
01:25:45,993 --> 01:25:49,702
is the young people
you get to work with.

1814
01:25:53,159 --> 01:25:57,909
You see 'em come up
as young kids... and mature.

1815
01:26:00,535 --> 01:26:03,827
See 'em grow up...

1816
01:26:03,827 --> 01:26:07,201
overcome some adversity,

1817
01:26:07,201 --> 01:26:09,743
have some success.

1818
01:26:11,034 --> 01:26:13,577
They turn out
to be good people.

1819
01:26:15,410 --> 01:26:17,993
They come back and say,

1820
01:26:17,993 --> 01:26:20,743
"Hey, Coach.

1821
01:26:20,743 --> 01:26:24,285
It was so great...

1822
01:26:24,285 --> 01:26:26,951
being a Penn State
football player."

1823
01:26:29,951 --> 01:26:31,201
Yeah.

1824
01:26:33,410 --> 01:26:35,618
My name...

1825
01:26:37,660 --> 01:26:41,577
I spent my whole life
trying to make that name
mean something.

1826
01:26:43,201 --> 01:26:44,868
And it's gone now.

1827
01:26:51,159 --> 01:26:53,285
( church bell ringing )

1828
01:26:57,827 --> 01:27:00,410
Man:
Aaron came forward
three years ago,

1829
01:27:00,410 --> 01:27:03,368
in this office,
after his school told him
not to report it

1830
01:27:03,368 --> 01:27:06,159
because Jerry Sandusky
had a heart of gold.

1831
01:27:06,159 --> 01:27:07,785
We contacted the police
that day,

1832
01:27:07,785 --> 01:27:09,785
and usually cases like this
it takes a week,

1833
01:27:09,785 --> 01:27:11,159
maybe a month, to get an arrest.

1834
01:27:11,159 --> 01:27:14,159
This took three years...
of waiting,

1835
01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:16,451
of a scared boy
telling a horror story,

1836
01:27:16,451 --> 01:27:20,076
to me, to a trooper,
to two other troopers,

1837
01:27:20,076 --> 01:27:22,451
to two other new  troopers,
a grand jury,

1838
01:27:22,451 --> 01:27:24,827
then a second grand jury,
and a third.

1839
01:27:24,827 --> 01:27:26,451
Still no arrest.

1840
01:27:26,451 --> 01:27:29,159
He suffered from panic attacks,

1841
01:27:29,159 --> 01:27:31,368
insomnia, conversion syndrome.

1842
01:27:31,368 --> 01:27:33,076
I don't recall how often

1843
01:27:33,076 --> 01:27:36,743
or how many times
he tried to kill himself.

1844
01:27:36,743 --> 01:27:39,868
Attorney generals
have looked him in the eye--

1845
01:27:39,868 --> 01:27:41,326
in the eye--

1846
01:27:41,326 --> 01:27:45,368
"and said, "We're gonna
arrest this monster next week."

1847
01:27:45,368 --> 01:27:47,201
Then more months
would go by,

1848
01:27:47,201 --> 01:27:48,827
and then more months
would go by.

1849
01:27:49,951 --> 01:27:51,618
Three years he stuck with this

1850
01:27:51,618 --> 01:27:54,743
because he didn't wanna see
another kid get hurt.

1851
01:27:54,743 --> 01:27:57,285
What do you think
about the Paterno situation?

1852
01:27:57,285 --> 01:28:01,118
I honestly don't know
why anybody's talking
about Joe Paterno.

1853
01:28:01,118 --> 01:28:03,993
Somebody six months
from retirement failed
to see the big picture

1854
01:28:03,993 --> 01:28:06,159
and didn't
vigorously protect children?

1855
01:28:06,159 --> 01:28:08,785
Of course you goddamn fire him.

1856
01:28:08,785 --> 01:28:12,993
It's spectacularly unworthy
of conversation. I'm sorry.

1857
01:28:12,993 --> 01:28:16,034
A crime against
children happened--

1858
01:28:16,034 --> 01:28:19,535
why the heck is anyone
talking about Joe Paterno?

1859
01:28:19,535 --> 01:28:23,451
Man:
Coaches on the same staff
for 32 years...

1860
01:28:23,451 --> 01:28:28,243
Man 2: Coaching staffs
spend so much time together
in a room,

1861
01:28:28,243 --> 01:28:31,535
in the dark, with the film on,
and talkin', and--

1862
01:28:31,535 --> 01:28:33,410
these guys are all close.

1863
01:28:33,410 --> 01:28:36,451
- ( opera plays on stereo )
- TV: Know what he's gonna do?

1864
01:28:36,451 --> 01:28:38,368
He's not going
to prop his feet up.

1865
01:28:38,368 --> 01:28:42,493
He's gonna go help young people
in a program that he started...

1866
01:28:42,493 --> 01:28:44,909
What's this?

1867
01:28:44,909 --> 01:28:46,827
Alamo Bowl.

1868
01:28:47,909 --> 01:28:49,451
When was it?

1869
01:28:49,451 --> 01:28:51,535
Everybody wants dates.
I don't know.

1870
01:28:53,368 --> 01:28:57,410
Before he retired.
'99, maybe.

1871
01:28:57,410 --> 01:29:01,660
Which one is, um,
New Orleans?

1872
01:29:01,660 --> 01:29:04,118
- What?
- Which bowl?

1873
01:29:04,118 --> 01:29:05,577
Sugar bowl.

1874
01:29:05,577 --> 01:29:08,118
That was in the '70's
a couple times.

1875
01:29:08,118 --> 01:29:10,618
Yeah.

1876
01:29:10,618 --> 01:29:12,243
He went in the pool
with the kids

1877
01:29:12,243 --> 01:29:15,577
at the bowl games
in New Orleans and Miami.

1878
01:29:15,577 --> 01:29:18,951
- Who? Jerry did?
- Yeah.

1879
01:29:18,951 --> 01:29:21,743
Well, you didn't like
to go in the pool, remember?

1880
01:29:23,993 --> 01:29:26,868
I mean, you were working,
on a towel,

1881
01:29:26,868 --> 01:29:29,660
and, uh, I went in with them.

1882
01:29:29,660 --> 01:29:32,451
But I don't throw the kids up
in the air. The dads do that.

1883
01:29:33,577 --> 01:29:36,285
And they-- they scream.

1884
01:29:36,285 --> 01:29:38,285
They just love that.

1885
01:29:38,285 --> 01:29:42,118
What? Our kids?

1886
01:29:42,118 --> 01:29:45,951
Yeah. I-- I didn't do that
with our kids. Jerry did.

1887
01:29:48,285 --> 01:29:50,034
What are you saying?

1888
01:29:50,034 --> 01:29:51,702
I'm saying
you couldn't have known.

1889
01:29:51,702 --> 01:29:55,159
Otherwise you wouldn't have
let them go in the pool, right?

1890
01:30:05,577 --> 01:30:08,159
I had a job to do.

1891
01:30:11,702 --> 01:30:15,118
I was working.

1892
01:30:15,118 --> 01:30:18,660
I wasn't focused
on the goddamn pool.

1893
01:30:35,243 --> 01:30:37,660
Announcer:
For decades, Penn State

1894
01:30:37,660 --> 01:30:41,368
represented what was best
about college athletics.

1895
01:30:41,368 --> 01:30:43,159
For the past week,
it has reflected

1896
01:30:43,159 --> 01:30:45,951
what is often worst
about human beings.

1897
01:30:45,951 --> 01:30:50,618
And today,
for the first time
since late 1965,

1898
01:30:50,618 --> 01:30:52,660
Joe Paterno
will not be the head coach,

1899
01:30:52,660 --> 01:30:55,285
and those in Beaver Stadium
hope that they can aid,

1900
01:30:55,285 --> 01:30:58,451
in some small way,
in the healing process.

1901
01:30:58,451 --> 01:31:00,285
Penn State and Nebraska.

1902
01:31:00,285 --> 01:31:02,743
From University Park,
Dave Pasch will have the call.

1903
01:31:05,868 --> 01:31:09,118
And the Nebraska
and Penn State players,

1904
01:31:09,118 --> 01:31:12,868
currently sharing
the sentiments of many
around the nation,

1905
01:31:12,868 --> 01:31:15,535
gathering in prayer...

1906
01:31:15,535 --> 01:31:17,743
for the victims
of these aberrations

1907
01:31:17,743 --> 01:31:20,702
to show their solidarity
and support.

1908
01:31:22,618 --> 01:31:27,326
And obviously,
an emotional day
for many reasons.

1909
01:31:27,326 --> 01:31:29,034
A lot of Joe Paterno fans.

1910
01:31:29,034 --> 01:31:31,743
Paterno was to pass
Amos Alonzo Stagg today

1911
01:31:31,743 --> 01:31:34,410
for most games coached
in Division I.

1912
01:31:34,410 --> 01:31:37,118
Commentator:
It's been a week nobody
could've imagined here, Dave,

1913
01:31:37,118 --> 01:31:38,743
at the state college,

1914
01:31:38,743 --> 01:31:41,577
the reach and scope
of all that has happened...

1915
01:31:41,577 --> 01:31:43,451
( broadcast fading out )

1916
01:31:47,743 --> 01:31:49,410
( chanting )
Penn State!

1917
01:31:50,577 --> 01:31:52,243
Penn State!

1918
01:31:54,118 --> 01:31:55,743
Penn State!

1919
01:31:57,577 --> 01:32:00,243
Penn State!

1920
01:32:00,243 --> 01:32:03,577
Announcer: It's been
such an emotional week
for the Paterno family,

1921
01:32:03,577 --> 01:32:05,951
and this morning
Jay Paterno went by early

1922
01:32:05,951 --> 01:32:08,243
to see his parents,
Joe and Sue.

1923
01:32:08,243 --> 01:32:11,034
Fearful that he might
not be able to contain
the emotions,

1924
01:32:11,034 --> 01:32:13,159
he wrote a letter,
but he asked that his parents

1925
01:32:13,159 --> 01:32:15,785
not read that letter
while he was there
at the house.

1926
01:32:15,785 --> 01:32:19,618
"Wait to read it later,
after I leave, Dad"
is what he told Joe.

1927
01:32:19,618 --> 01:32:21,618
A letter to be read, basically
giving him the message

1928
01:32:21,618 --> 01:32:24,493
of what he means to him,
what this day means to him.

1929
01:32:26,076 --> 01:32:27,493
Martinez keeping,

1930
01:32:27,493 --> 01:32:29,159
and then pitching it
the last second,

1931
01:32:29,159 --> 01:32:33,410
and Burkehead is in--
touchdown, Nebraska!

1932
01:32:33,410 --> 01:32:37,993
And Nebraska has opened up
a 17-0 lead.

1933
01:32:37,993 --> 01:32:39,785
( crowd cheering )

1934
01:32:39,785 --> 01:32:41,285
We hear in the background

1935
01:32:41,285 --> 01:32:43,868
chants from the student section
for JoePa...

1936
01:32:43,868 --> 01:32:46,368
Female commentator:
The Paternos must be
a letter-writing family.

1937
01:32:46,368 --> 01:32:48,118
Matt McGloin told me
that Joe Paterno

1938
01:32:48,118 --> 01:32:49,951
sent a letter to the players,
a short note,

1939
01:32:49,951 --> 01:32:52,243
and in that letter it said
that he was heartbroken,

1940
01:32:52,243 --> 01:32:54,159
sorry he couldn't be with them,

1941
01:32:54,159 --> 01:32:57,660
but he wanted them to focus
on this game and not on him.

1942
01:32:57,660 --> 01:32:58,951
Dave?

1943
01:32:58,951 --> 01:33:01,493
Pasch:
And McGloin fumbled the ball!

1944
01:33:01,493 --> 01:33:03,868
( crowd roaring )

1945
01:33:06,118 --> 01:33:09,368
( broadcast continues,
indistinct )

1946
01:33:19,827 --> 01:33:22,159
...touchdown!

1947
01:33:22,159 --> 01:33:24,118
Two scores in five minutes

1948
01:33:24,118 --> 01:33:27,159
and Penn State is back within
three, with the football.

1949
01:33:27,159 --> 01:33:29,618
...there's always Joe Paterno
on what to do here,

1950
01:33:29,618 --> 01:33:31,326
whether to go
on fourth-and-one.

1951
01:33:31,326 --> 01:33:34,660
Penn State down three.

1952
01:33:34,660 --> 01:33:37,909
If McGloin gets the play off,
this'll be the final play.

1953
01:33:37,909 --> 01:33:40,285
McGloin running around...

1954
01:33:40,285 --> 01:33:41,868
( crowd roars )

1955
01:33:41,868 --> 01:33:44,868
...and it's incomplete.
Nebraska wins!

1956
01:33:53,285 --> 01:33:56,076
( chatter )

1957
01:33:56,076 --> 01:33:57,743
- Roll for me, Charlie.
- Right.

1958
01:33:59,201 --> 01:34:00,535
Oh!

1959
01:34:00,535 --> 01:34:04,451
The D came out in nickel,
stacked the strong side.

1960
01:34:04,451 --> 01:34:06,868
The O-line got no push.

1961
01:34:09,368 --> 01:34:10,201
What is that?

1962
01:34:11,868 --> 01:34:12,743
Hey, Dad?

1963
01:34:14,034 --> 01:34:16,743
Listen, I talked
to Merrick.

1964
01:34:16,743 --> 01:34:17,868
The Big Ten wants to...

1965
01:34:19,451 --> 01:34:21,535
...change the name
on the trophy.

1966
01:34:21,535 --> 01:34:22,535
Scott:
What?

1967
01:34:22,535 --> 01:34:24,368
The Stagg-Paterno Trophy?

1968
01:34:24,368 --> 01:34:25,660
What the hell
they gonna call it?

1969
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:27,285
Jay:
I don't know.

1970
01:34:27,285 --> 01:34:29,909
I think we call Jim Delany
and-- and talk him down.

1971
01:34:29,909 --> 01:34:31,785
- It's a panic move.
- No, no--

1972
01:34:31,785 --> 01:34:33,702
- Dan McGinn should call.
- Yeah, you're right.

1973
01:34:33,702 --> 01:34:35,285
They're not gonna
announce till Monday.

1974
01:34:35,285 --> 01:34:37,076
If we get to Delany today,
then it'll be fine.

1975
01:34:37,076 --> 01:34:39,535
- Stop.
- No, this is not where we stop.

1976
01:34:39,535 --> 01:34:41,909
This is where we fight.
This is where it starts.

1977
01:34:41,909 --> 01:34:44,076
- We're in the fight
of our lives for this...
- Stop.

1978
01:34:44,076 --> 01:34:45,743
Stop!!!

1979
01:34:49,118 --> 01:34:52,076
No more. No more...

1980
01:34:58,410 --> 01:35:00,076
( wheezing )

1981
01:35:09,118 --> 01:35:11,909
( MRI machine vibrating )

1982
01:35:17,285 --> 01:35:20,159
Sue ( voice echoing ):
He went in the pool
with the kids at bowl games.

1983
01:35:21,660 --> 01:35:24,451
Paterno:
Our kids?

1984
01:35:24,451 --> 01:35:26,451
Sue:
You couldn't have known.

1985
01:35:26,451 --> 01:35:29,159
Otherwise you wouldn't have
let them go in the pool.

1986
01:35:32,034 --> 01:35:33,951
Paterno:
I was working.

1987
01:35:33,951 --> 01:35:39,451
I wasn't focused
on the goddamn pool.

1988
01:35:39,451 --> 01:35:42,159
Sue: Joe!

1989
01:35:42,159 --> 01:35:44,451
Joe, get in the pool.
Go play with Jay!

1990
01:35:44,451 --> 01:35:47,785
Dad, come get in the pool.
Come here, Dad.

1991
01:35:47,785 --> 01:35:52,326
Joe, get in the pool!
Go play with Jay.

1992
01:35:52,326 --> 01:35:53,951
Jay:
Dad. Come here, Dad.

1993
01:35:53,951 --> 01:35:55,827
- ( kids laughing )
- Sue: Joe!

1994
01:35:57,660 --> 01:36:00,535
- Jay: Come here, Dad!
- Sue: Joe!

1995
01:36:17,076 --> 01:36:19,159
( kids laughing )

1996
01:36:42,535 --> 01:36:44,909
Aah! Oh my-- Aah--

1997
01:36:44,909 --> 01:36:46,493
Paterno:
Aah!

1998
01:36:46,493 --> 01:36:48,660
( gasping )

1999
01:36:55,285 --> 01:36:59,535
Man:
It's a small-cell carcinoma
in the left lung,

2000
01:36:59,535 --> 01:37:02,743
and it looks like
it's metastasized, which--

2001
01:37:02,743 --> 01:37:04,993
It's not what we want to see.

2002
01:37:04,993 --> 01:37:07,326
And we're gonna go at it
with all we've got.

2003
01:37:07,326 --> 01:37:08,785
That means chemotherapy,

2004
01:37:08,785 --> 01:37:11,410
and then, of course,
with radiation.

2005
01:37:11,410 --> 01:37:14,660
But given the bronchitis
you've got now,

2006
01:37:14,660 --> 01:37:17,785
your broken pelvis,
and your age...

2007
01:37:17,785 --> 01:37:19,909
( voice fading out )

2008
01:37:41,076 --> 01:37:44,243
( men arguing )

2009
01:37:44,243 --> 01:37:46,118
- Just leave me alone.
- Get the fuck out of here!

2010
01:37:46,118 --> 01:37:48,285
- This is wrong.
- You're wrong, pal.

2011
01:37:48,285 --> 01:37:49,785
Everybody's got
an opinion.

2012
01:37:49,785 --> 01:37:50,951
What makes
yours special, huh?

2013
01:37:50,951 --> 01:37:52,368
Get out of here.

2014
01:37:52,368 --> 01:37:54,076
Man:
Get the fuck out of here.

2015
01:37:59,618 --> 01:38:01,493
( phone ringing )

2016
01:38:05,618 --> 01:38:07,118
( ringing )

2017
01:38:08,493 --> 01:38:09,951
Sara Ganim.

2018
01:38:11,951 --> 01:38:13,285
Hello?

2019
01:38:13,285 --> 01:38:14,702
Man: Hi.

2020
01:38:14,702 --> 01:38:17,159
H-Hi. Who-- who is this?

2021
01:38:17,159 --> 01:38:20,410
Um, do I have to say right now?

2022
01:38:20,410 --> 01:38:23,118
Uh, n-n-no?

2023
01:38:23,118 --> 01:38:25,285
Whatever's comfortable.

2024
01:38:25,285 --> 01:38:29,326
Um, m-my lawyer said
I should call you. I--

2025
01:38:29,326 --> 01:38:30,951
I grew up in State College.

2026
01:38:30,951 --> 01:38:32,743
Okay.

2027
01:38:32,743 --> 01:38:35,743
Jerry Sandusky...

2028
01:38:35,743 --> 01:38:39,326
Yeah. Um...

2029
01:38:39,326 --> 01:38:40,868
there are a lot
of people who have--

2030
01:38:40,868 --> 01:38:43,951
have gone through this.
I'm sure you know that.

2031
01:38:43,951 --> 01:38:45,702
Yeah. ( clears throat )

2032
01:38:45,702 --> 01:38:49,326
Um, have you--
have you talked
to anyone about this?

2033
01:38:49,326 --> 01:38:53,993
Well, the lawyer and...
I talked to Joe.

2034
01:38:55,326 --> 01:38:58,660
Joe... J-Joe Paterno?

2035
01:38:58,660 --> 01:39:01,660
We-- We didn't really
talk about it.

2036
01:39:01,660 --> 01:39:05,285
He said that Jerry's,
um, a good man,

2037
01:39:05,285 --> 01:39:07,660
and I shouldn't talk that way
about a good man.

2038
01:39:09,702 --> 01:39:11,993
That was pretty much it.

2039
01:39:11,993 --> 01:39:12,993
Okay.

2040
01:39:17,159 --> 01:39:20,076
And, um, do you, uh--

2041
01:39:20,076 --> 01:39:22,410
Do you remember
when exactly it was
that this--

2042
01:39:22,410 --> 01:39:25,201
that this all took place?

2043
01:39:25,201 --> 01:39:28,868
Yeah. It was in summer.

2044
01:39:28,868 --> 01:39:31,034
In 1976.

2045
01:39:31,034 --> 01:39:32,076
Uh--

2046
01:39:33,410 --> 01:39:37,034
Uh, I'm sorry.
You said...1976?

2047
01:39:41,535 --> 01:39:44,076
