1
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,319
Is there nothing more?

2
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,516
A man was appointed
to my garrison two weeks ago.

3
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,280
He's very strong with a sword.

4
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,555
Yes, good to know.

5
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,875
Do you have other men?

6
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,030
Of course.

7
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,189
Nero, protector of Rome.

8
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,871
Let him be the center of your home.

9
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,795
Our blessed emperor,
Nero, protector of Rome.

10
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,752
Yes, it's good. For you.

11
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,877
Strong, healthy, good teeth.

12
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,360
He will serve you well.

13
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,714
Care for company?

14
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,276
- Look, it's Luke.
- Who are you speaking of?

15
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,350
Is that Luke?

16
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,430
Praise God.

17
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,955
It is Luke.

18
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,390
Luke?

19
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,030
Priscilla.

20
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,153
- Thank you, Eubulus.
- Of course.

21
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,710
Luke.

22
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,434
Praise God.

23
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,479
We were beginning to be worried.

24
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,916
I had to wait at the gates
longer than expected,

25
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,754
but here we are.

26
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,071
This place, so many people.

27
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,800
There were so many who
lost their homes in the fires,

28
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,670
others threatened by neighbors,
persecuted in the streets.

29
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,838
Come. Aquila's inside.

30
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,436
Aquila.

31
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,190
Aquila.

32
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,719
Luke. What a sight
for these weary eyes.

33
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,439
I'm glad to see you, brother.

34
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,117
The arrangements you made
were in perfect order.

35
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,396
These are terrible times.
We could take no chances.

36
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,791
I know. Your letters that reached us
have torn the community's heart out,

37
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,758
so we took up a collection.

38
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,559
It's not as much as I had hoped.

39
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,000
Food and supplies are running low.

40
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,992
We are most grateful for every coin.

41
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,278
Tarquin, speak with Heroditon and Rufus

42
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,556
about what is
most urgently needed. Go on.

43
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,109
Tarquin? But he's so young for orders.

44
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,953
He's loyal. He's a Roman boy.

45
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,039
He lost both his parents in the fires.

46
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,715
We took him in.
This is Cassius, his cousin.

47
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,951
He followed when he heard
what the community was doing.

48
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,679
He was baptized soon after.

49
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,712
Aquila, can everyone here be trusted?

50
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,120
We trust in God.

51
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,510
Come, let's eat. You must be starving.

52
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,150
Your cooking?

53
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,118
I don't know if I'm that hungry.

54
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,714
There is a darkness
over this city now that

55
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,110
was not present
when Paul and I were here last.

56
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,157
Nero's cruelties have worsened.

57
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,800
He holds his circus games
with more regularity.

58
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,233
Men, women, children

59
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,832
torn apart by wild beasts
to the laughter of the crowd.

60
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,070
Oh, my God.

61
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,677
Nero says the reason is
to show the Roman people

62
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,355
that these followers of Christ
were responsible

63
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,591
for burning half the city
to the ground.

64
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,639
What of all our brothers and
sisters that you shelter here?

65
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,633
How much longer
can you hide them?

66
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,200
We don't know, Luke.

67
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,520
We're at a crossroads.

68
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,876
We're not sure whether
to continue here in faith

69
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,435
or to move the whole community
out of Rome.

70
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,280
Priscilla...

71
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,591
With such great persecution, why stay?

72
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,640
People are desperate.

73
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,032
We're the only light left in this city.

74
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,395
But in staying,

75
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,949
we put a great deal of lives
in danger.

76
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,997
There are many families here.

77
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,959
- Perhaps when you speak to Paul...
- Yes.

78
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,518
Yes, he will shed light on this.

79
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,920
He will know what to do.

80
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,195
We would be grateful.

81
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,115
Luke.

82
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,112
I know you need rest,

83
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,399
but there are a great many people
here in need of a physician.

84
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,154
Show me to them.

85
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,678
Take this limestone, come on!

86
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,359
Come on, move!

87
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,236
Enough.

88
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,315
Get him up.

89
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,913
Come on, you. Get up.

90
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,920
Paul of Tarsus.

91
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,794
The man responsible for half
of Rome laying in ashes.

92
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,560
I expected more.

93
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,399
At least a man
who could stand straight.

94
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,634
I am Mauritius Gallas,

95
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,677
Commander of the Third Legion of Rome.

96
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,234
And now the new Prefect
of the Mamertine Prison.

97
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,115
"His greatness Emperor Nero
has hereby proclaimed you

98
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,873
"a corrupter and deceiver,

99
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,395
"and a capital charge has been
brought upon you for treason.

100
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,870
"For this crime,
the punishment is death

101
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,156
"by beheading
upon Emperor Nero's decree."

102
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,394
In the meantime, you'll be
left alone in the darkness.

103
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,717
Another 20 lashes for the old man.

104
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,992
Forged Roman documents.

105
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,120
Use these if you get stopped
by guards in the city.

106
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,437
A quick glance and they'll pass,

107
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,110
but a longer look will get you killed.

108
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,190
Understood.

109
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,800
That's the signal.

110
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,156
The peace of our Lord
be with you, my brother.

111
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,390
I'll need it.

112
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,475
Just remember,

113
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,993
you only get back out
if I decide you do.

114
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,438
You are most certainly a powerful man.

115
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,994
I will come back
before the night watch ends.

116
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,635
Hello, brother.

117
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,790
Brother.

118
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,835
Luke.

119
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,829
Am I dreaming?

120
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,556
No.

121
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,469
I'm here.

122
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,914
Praise God.

123
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,796
- Praise God.
- You have fresh wounds.

124
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,310
Get up.

125
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,550
Can you sit?

126
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,756
Come sit.

127
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,910
Yes.

128
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,876
I did not expect to see
your face in this life again.

129
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,950
Nor I yours.

130
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,190
Getting in here must have come
at a great price.

131
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,070
Surely the money could
have been put to better use

132
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,674
for our brothers and sisters.

133
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,830
Perhaps.

134
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,914
But there wasn't a single vote of
disagreement amongst the communities,

135
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,277
even the Corinthians gave generously,
if you can believe it. Sorry.

136
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,280
I am grateful.

137
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,675
I've become an old man
inside these walls.

138
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,950
Every bone is wracked with pain.

139
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,759
My eyesight
has become even weaker.

140
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,754
Quit your complaining.

141
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,160
I have new robes

142
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,520
and fresh water to bathe.

143
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,472
So you shall be a clean old man.

144
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,920
I'm glad to see you kept
yourself busy while I was gone.

145
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,232
Getting yourself arrested again,

146
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,193
challenging Nero again,

147
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,517
and apparently finding the time
to burn down half of Rome?

148
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,560
Well done, old man.

149
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,709
I received the news
about your trial at the Forum.

150
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,760
I know you stood alone.

151
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,316
You know I would have
never left your side.

152
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,959
You are here now.

153
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,676
And so I am.

154
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,433
Tell me some good news
that I might hold onto.

155
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,276
There is good news
in Crete and Ephesus.

156
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,679
Titus and Timothy have silenced
the false teachers

157
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,638
and straightened out the good doctrine.

158
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,995
And what is the news of this city?

159
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,836
Rome is stained with the blood
of our brothers and sisters.

160
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,913
Aquila and Priscilla are faced

161
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,471
with the difficult decision
whether to stay or to flee.

162
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,395
Paul, there is much for us to discuss,

163
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,517
but the Roman communities need...

164
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,476
They need wisdom
at this very moment.

165
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,317
What wisdom can I give?

166
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,480
I have gone right,
Christ has sent me left.

167
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,920
I've gone left,

168
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,672
and Christ has pushed me right.

169
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,239
I have many regrets,

170
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,752
made many mistakes,
but everything I have done,

171
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,439
I have done for Christ.

172
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,436
Go.

173
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,514
I'll be back soon.

174
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,838
He's physically shattered,

175
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,434
but the cantankerous old soul
remains full of hope and conviction.

176
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,635
It's welcome news.

177
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,760
I've been praying that this
solitude wouldn't crush him.

178
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,160
He is not crushed,

179
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,200
but he does struggle

180
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,031
that his work for Christ
has come to an end.

181
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,197
Paul is grateful that you have
risked your lives for this community.

182
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,437
Did he have any wisdom
on the matter?

183
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,952
He is urging you
to discern for yourselves

184
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,474
where Christ is calling you.

185
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,040
No specific instructions?

186
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,755
No.

187
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,510
Only to offer an example
of his own life.

188
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,200
He's much better today.

189
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,430
He looks...

190
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,759
Here, drink this.

191
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,874
It will help with the pain.

192
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,350
Priscilla?

193
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,430
Priscilla!

194
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,832
- Priscilla!
- I'm here. I'm here.

195
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,278
Octavia? What's happened?

196
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,556
I found her wandering
the streets like this.

197
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,990
Sit.

198
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,560
Sit, sit, sit.

199
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,474
Where are you hurt?

200
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,395
- Where?
- Octavia, where are you hurt?

201
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,630
Where are you...

202
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,480
They've killed my husband.

203
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,519
And my little baby boy.

204
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,792
They broke down the doors!

205
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,951
We should have come here sooner.

206
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,078
You're bleeding.
Where are you hurt?

207
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,909
It's not my blood.

208
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,040
It's my...

209
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,318
It's my baby's blood.

210
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,676
It's my baby's blood.

211
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,429
Take her inside, out of sight
of the others, please.

212
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,951
Come on. You're safe.

213
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,471
- No, no.
- Come. Come.

214
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,830
They were all watching this poor woman

215
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,398
covered in the blood of her family

216
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,074
that had just been slaughtered.

217
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,800
Their faces were filled
with a great fear.

218
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,077
Christ has promised these

219
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,240
difficult times.

220
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,750
You know you will die here in Rome.

221
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,637
Yet you are certain of the truth.

222
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,316
I know the one in whom I believe.

223
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,037
And I am certain of the joy

224
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,994
of where I go.

225
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,678
Yes, but I don't see the same
conviction in the others, Paul.

226
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,198
These men, these women, these children.

227
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,158
I cannot fix their faith.

228
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,071
You can inspire their faith,

229
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,319
just as your...
Your letters always have.

230
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,076
You want me to write another letter?

231
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,837
It's time to get the blood flowing.

232
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,240
The Way is growing.

233
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,514
There are men, women, children
now that have never met you,

234
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,319
that will never meet you,

235
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,313
so there must be a handwritten
account of these Acts.

236
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,555
It is for the same reason
that I undertook an account

237
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,030
of our Lord Jesus Christ
for Theophilus.

238
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,555
So that he would know
the story of Christ,

239
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,839
and now the people
must know your story.

240
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,837
You risk people looking to me

241
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,716
before Christ.

242
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,870
Paul.

243
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,274
No, it is your certainty
that opens the door to Christ.

244
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,391
I have never met Christ in the flesh,

245
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,637
but the day I heard you preach in Troas,

246
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,030
my God, I saw Christ in you.

247
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,597
I left my family and my friends,
my whole life behind.

248
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,833
You would write it in here?

249
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,913
What did you say?

250
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,954
You would write it here?

251
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,190
Yes.

252
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,592
I could smuggle the tools in here.

253
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,870
This is not like our last visit to Rome.

254
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,037
If you were caught with documents

255
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,314
coming from this prison,

256
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,240
it could mean certain death.

257
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,433
Greek. Get up.

258
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,155
Usually people try
to escape this place,

259
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,120
not break into it.

260
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,550
- They tell me you're a physician.
- I am.

261
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,155
You have high-ranking friends
for a physician.

262
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,679
Especially a Greek physician.

263
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,310
The emperor has declared
Christianity a forbidden cult

264
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,631
and Paul of Tarsus,
the chief offender.

265
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,074
You understand the risk is death,

266
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,237
and yet you, a Greek Christian,

267
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,520
boldly walk into a Roman prison.

268
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,671
Boldly walk into my prison.

269
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,280
My apologies...

270
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,356
Prefect.

271
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,513
As you have said,
I have high-ranking friends.

272
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,160
I know the men
that you have favor with.

273
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,914
These are good men,

274
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,829
that have fought and bled
for Rome and her gods.

275
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,600
It's the only reason
I honor this request.

276
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,519
I am grateful for it.

277
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,431
Escort the Greek back to the streets.

278
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,955
He must, of course, still
take his chances out there.

279
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,352
- What are you doing here?
- Only passing through.

280
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,439
- Of course, you are.
- Only passing through.

281
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,034
Let's have a look
at those documents.

282
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,600
I would never betray our gods. Never.

283
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,194
- Oh, yeah?
- I would never betray our gods. Never.

284
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,795
- All right.
- Hey, you. You, come here.

285
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,230
You, out.

286
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,120
Show me your documents.

287
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,632
I swear, I will...
I will tell the others.

288
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,040
What are you going to do about it?

289
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,157
- What? Why do you bring it up?
- Get away from me, okay?

290
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,754
- You get away from me!
- This is...

291
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,270
Set him on fire!

292
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,320
More oil!

293
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,354
Here's your torch.

294
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,070
Like a candle.

295
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,716
You see this?

296
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,069
Burn him alive.

297
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,196
- Pray unto your God now.
- No. No.

298
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,356
Traitor.

299
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,633
We want to hear you scream!

300
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,156
Aquila.

301
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,478
I woke up. You weren't there.

302
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,309
I couldn't sleep.

303
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,513
Luke's back. He's safe.

304
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,470
Good.

305
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,675
That's good.

306
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,196
We've loved this city as our own.

307
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,992
I only see what it's become.

308
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,400
Nero's Rome.

309
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,360
Nero's madness.

310
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,316
It'll pass.

311
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,040
He can't be emperor forever.

312
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,351
How many more people
will die before then?

313
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,351
This decision weighs heavily on me.

314
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,317
I receive no wisdom in prayer.

315
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,677
In staying, we put the lives
of all our brothers and sisters

316
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,399
under this roof in danger.

317
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,554
And if we go,
how many people that rely on us

318
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,591
do we condemn to a terrible fate?

319
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,680
Christ was clear when he said

320
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,911
he was sending us out
amongst the wolves.

321
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,710
He also told us
to be as wise as serpents.

322
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,152
And harmless as doves.

323
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,480
As Paul has said,

324
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,440
we must each make
our own decision.

325
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,560
She loves these people.

326
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,120
Like her children.

327
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,078
And yet she still finds room
in her heart

328
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,072
for all of those lost in Rome.

329
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,396
Something that doesn't come
as easily to me.

330
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,674
Aquila, I saw them burning
a body this morning.

331
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,994
He was a man
I recognized from here.

332
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,240
Someone I helped.

333
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,309
I did nothing.

334
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,157
I feel no love for these Romans.

335
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,150
This evil makes no sense to me.

336
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,797
We were asked
to build a community...

337
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,837
We were asked to build a community
in this city,

338
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,552
to preach the gospel
of Jesus Christ,

339
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,718
to love this city,

340
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,352
but I can no longer see
a clear answer for a way forward.

341
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,434
What does Paul say?

342
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,031
That this is something that

343
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,792
falls to each man and woman

344
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,593
in their thoughts and prayers.

345
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,869
Some of you
have families, have children.

346
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:28,070
I understand you want to protect them
or feel called to stay.

347
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,270
It's a risk for even one of us, Aquila,
to try and slip in and out of the gates.

348
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,878
How could we possibly all get out?

349
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,995
I have asked Eubulus to find us a way.

350
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,911
There's an old aqueduct
that lies beneath the new city.

351
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,798
It's been long buried and forgotten.

352
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,120
The entrance to these tunnels
lies beneath a property

353
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,159
owned by a trio
of wealthy Roman families.

354
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,790
And why would they help us?

355
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,191
Because they realize that Nero
was responsible for burning

356
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,760
half of their city to the ground.

357
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,240
They want the tyrant dead

358
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,073
and Rome returned to the people.

359
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,674
Now, we may have favor,

360
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,834
but be under no illusion,

361
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,033
this will not be an easy task.

362
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,960
- And where will we go?
- To Ephesus.

363
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,396
Timothy is there
and they will welcome us.

364
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,995
And the Greeks are
far more tolerant of us.

365
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,914
We were Romans
before we were Christian.

366
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,560
This is our home.

367
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,756
I do not take this decision lightly.

368
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:34,400
But I believe that there is
more good to be done outside of Rome.

369
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,955
Aquila's right.

370
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,635
But I think there's also
some good in staying.

371
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,236
It's true,
we've never seen Rome darker.

372
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,355
But if we abandon it,
will it not be cast into total darkness?

373
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,431
Who would have taken Tarquin in?

374
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,274
You know what happens
to orphans in this city.

375
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,557
They're left on the streets to die.

376
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,838
Or they're forced into
prostitution at the temples.

377
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,472
There are widows
on the street corners

378
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,671
begging for coins
to feed their children.

379
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,713
If we abandon them,

380
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,680
who will feed them?

381
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,594
Who will care?

382
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,916
Nero is responsible for the
deaths in my family, not Rome.

383
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,399
Aquila speaks of those
that want to overthrow Nero.

384
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,914
Are these not allies of ours?

385
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,355
Yes, indeed. We are allies.

386
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,033
And think of the good
that could be done

387
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,271
once Rome is delivered
from Nero's evil grip.

388
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,592
There are no easy answers.

389
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,917
Trust in God to lead the way.

390
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,438
The most difficult part
will be getting news to these families,

391
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,798
so that they can open the tunnels
in an area we can pass unseen.

392
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,520
Someone will have to go
to Palatine Hill, but it's...

393
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,960
It's almost impossible.

394
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,470
Nero trusts none of these people.
He has eyes everywhere.

395
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,354
I'll go.

396
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,270
No, Tarquin.

397
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,835
I can go. They all think
I'm an orphan, a beggar.

398
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,033
No one will look twice.

399
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,480
I want to help.

400
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,273
Tarquin, come here.

401
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,079
Take this to our Roman friends

402
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,470
and tell them that we
gratefully accept their help.

403
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,032
You are a very brave boy.

404
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,600
Now, please be careful.

405
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,956
Yeah?

406
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,670
Go on.

407
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,630
Safe journey.

408
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,233
- Bless you, son.
- Thank you.

409
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,270
Be safe.

410
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,034
Best of luck.

411
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,713
- Good luck.
- Walk in peace.

412
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,675
- I know you can do this.
- Yes.

413
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,639
- Be strong.
- I will.

414
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,797
- I'm proud of you. Go.
- Thank you.

415
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,636
My life did not begin with hate.

416
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,395
I don't recall the feeling as a child.

417
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,480
I always felt myself to be
more a sheep in the midst of wolves.

418
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,594
Innocent as a dove.

419
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,235
I was in the temple
keeping true to my fasts, my prayers.

420
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,991
Stephen was out in the streets,

421
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,596
bringing charity
to widows and orphans,

422
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,592
preaching truth to drunks

423
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,000
and the crippled.

424
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,076
I was blameless
in the ancient law of Israel,

425
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:14,229
<i>while Stephen was blaspheming
on the very holy ground of God.</i>

426
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,880
<i>So what did you do?</i>

427
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,400
<i>We spread lies,</i>

428
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,394
<i>created an uproar
that had him brought to trial.</i>

429
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,153
What did he argue?

430
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,870
That Jesus was the Messiah.

431
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,234
And the temple of God
was no longer the only place

432
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,152
where God could be worshiped.

433
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,514
<i>Blasphemy.</i>

434
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,118
<i>I heard his final words even
amongst the roar of the crowd.</i>

435
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,596
<i>"Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.</i>

436
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,114
<i>"Lord, do not hold
this sin against them."</i>

437
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,552
Even in death,
a final blasphemy on his lips.

438
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,959
In that moment, I vowed to destroy

439
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:14,478
all those that spoke of this
Jesus of Nazareth as the Messiah.

440
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,478
Your grace is sufficient.

441
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,473
Your grace is sufficient.

442
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,838
The wall can never
be breached here. Never.

443
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,396
- The reports from the night.
- And the Greek?

444
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,559
He came and went once more.

445
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,272
What do you know about Paul of Tarsus?

446
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,477
There are plenty of
rumors that circulate.

447
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,117
A magician. A god.

448
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,076
A madman.

449
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,637
Why does that Greek care
to visit him in that disgusting pit?

450
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,278
He dictates something to him.

451
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,670
A letter?

452
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,836
A story.

453
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,713
Her condition is no better.

454
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,595
She will be healed.

455
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,075
And if not?

456
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,555
<i>Saul... Saul...</i>

457
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,040
<i>Saul... Saul... Saul...</i>

458
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,271
<i>Saul... Saul...</i>

459
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,716
<i>Saul...</i>

460
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,070
<i>Saul,</i>

461
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,751
<i>why do you persecute me?</i>

462
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,877
<i>Paul. Paul.</i>

463
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,396
Paul.

464
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,200
Give me your hand.

465
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,595
You were screaming out.

466
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,560
The devil sneaks in the darkness here.

467
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,915
Taunts me...

468
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,550
Day and night...

469
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,837
Reminding me of this
terrible thorn in my flesh.

470
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,273
I'm haunted by myself as a child.

471
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,516
I wish to warn him
of the path he will take.

472
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,314
All these years,
I have had a vision of them.

473
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,393
I see them

474
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,712
waiting

475
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,999
somewhere...

476
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,796
But I do not know this place.

477
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,312
<i>Its meaning has always
been hidden from me.</i>

478
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,954
<i>A torturous muse, the devil whispers</i>

479
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,680
<i>that they've found no peace...</i>

480
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,152
<i>They've found no joy.</i>

481
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:38,312
I was remembering
when Caelia was a little girl.

482
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,157
She used to sit at the window

483
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,637
and watch small sparrows

484
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,152
sing and fly around the garden.

485
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,230
She would have been there
all day if I'd let her.

486
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,831
Do you remember our place
before the fires?

487
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,437
The light through the windows...

488
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,557
Flowers, the trees in the garden.

489
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,512
I was a noble woman.

490
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,076
The wife of a Roman hero.

491
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,753
It is Nero's madness.

492
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,036
I do not blame Nero.

493
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,878
It is no help that you walk
around this place

494
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,156
as if the gods have already taken her.

495
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:29,278
Don't you think you anger them by acting
like they have no power to heal?

496
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:33,070
I have been sacrificing faithfully
every day!

497
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,990
My conscience is clean.

498
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:41,436
I do not think that I'm the one
the gods refuse to listen to.

499
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,630
There he is.

500
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,040
Mauritius...

501
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,760
Your glum mood threatens
to make this lovely lass

502
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,797
more expensive
than she needs to be.

503
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,759
- Here, let me order you one. Elysius.
- Publius.

504
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,239
Thank you, no.

505
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,640
Run along.

506
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,232
How is prison life?

507
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,199
You know as well as I
it's a disgrace.

508
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,193
A black mark of dishonor
on my house and family.

509
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,793
Twenty years of service to Rome,

510
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,156
risking my life
to earn my citizenship,

511
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,153
and now forced to take
idle servant's work

512
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,870
while Nero makes a mockery
of everything Rome stands for.

513
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,838
These are the troubled times,
my friend.

514
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,034
But that is why the gods keep
the day of our death a mystery,

515
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,316
so that we can enjoy this life.

516
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,874
I'm sorry.

517
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,997
Friend, how is your daughter?

518
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,874
Worse by the day.

519
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,474
I sacrifice to Bona Dea,
but she does not reply.

520
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,075
Then sacrifice to Carna or Meditrina,

521
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,879
and to Felicitas, Fortuna...

522
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,316
Juno, Libera, Sors, Spes, Trivia.

523
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,596
There are a hundred gods
that stand by.

524
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,680
Paul of Tarsus is under my watch.

525
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,031
The man responsible
for burning down Rome?

526
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,074
He's nothing but Nero's scapegoat.

527
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,875
What do you really know
about these Christians?

528
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,791
I rarely find them in the
establishments that I frequent.

529
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,678
But I do know
they have a strange affection

530
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,673
for poor widows
and ugly orphans.

531
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,676
But if you want to know
what the gods think of them,

532
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,433
just take a look around.

533
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,479
You'll see they're not even fit
to light the streets of Rome.

534
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,832
There is a Greek who slips in and out,

535
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,912
transcribing letters of some sort.

536
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,752
Mauritius, your mind
has gone to rubbish

537
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,991
in the darkness of that prison.

538
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,557
What if you were to seize
these letters,

539
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,109
find something, anything,
that relates to the crimes

540
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,431
- he's been charged of?
- Nero does not need evidence.

541
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,398
Assassination is in the air.

542
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,359
Half the city believes Nero
started the fires himself.

543
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,636
But if you were to bring him something

544
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,030
that shows that this
Christian did conspire

545
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,636
and burn down Rome, you
would be a hero in Nero's eyes,

546
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,871
the most honored man in all Rome.

547
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,791
Mauritius, think of your daughter.

548
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,793
How much more would the gods listen

549
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,839
if the emperor himself made
a sacrifice for her?

550
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,796
Is it true that
he has seen the Messiah?

551
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,240
Paul, that is.

552
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,720
Where's Luke? Luke!

553
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,240
Eubulus! Clear the table! Now!

554
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,634
Aquila.

555
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,752
Careful. Careful. Lie him here.

556
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,118
I found him in the street.

557
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,517
They said he was beaten by soldiers

558
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,557
after leaving Palatine Hill.

559
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,554
No!

560
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,751
No. No.

561
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,554
This is what trusting God gets you.

562
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,758
We must retaliate for this brutal act.

563
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,355
Many of us have only
a short time left in this city.

564
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,909
- We must hold strong now.
- Hold strong?

565
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,997
So we're like diseased dogs, then?

566
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,993
We do nothing to defend ourselves,

567
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,311
while we are chased from
the city just to be hunted down

568
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,039
- and killed.
- Cassius!

569
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,071
We understand your anger.

570
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,031
Tarquin was like a son to us.

571
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,077
I should never have let him go.

572
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,238
Why do you blame yourselves

573
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,357
and not the ones who have murdered him?

574
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,235
And who else have they taken from you?

575
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,317
This woman has come to you

576
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,834
covered in the blood of her child.

577
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,959
And what would you do, Cassius?

578
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,160
Tell me.
What would you do?

579
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,880
We do what they do to us.

580
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,235
Yes.

581
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,712
Murder them in the cover of darkness!

582
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,713
- I'm with you, Cassius!
- Set fire and burn them

583
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,314
in their homes while they sleep!

584
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,392
You speak as if
your ears have never heard

585
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,596
the words of Christ.

586
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,512
You never walked with Christ!

587
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,877
How can you say he would
say these things in the face of

588
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,078
- such an evil like Nero?
- Quiet!

589
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,753
Be still.

590
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,473
None of us here
have walked with Christ.

591
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,398
But Paul has followed him
longer than us all.

592
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,520
I have watched him be beaten,

593
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,672
I have watched him
be stoned and flogged,

594
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,354
and never once did he raise his finger
against his oppressors.

595
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:31,597
Let peace be with you,
for we live in the world,

596
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,275
but we do not wage war
as the world does.

597
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,553
Peace begins with you, Cassius.

598
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,994
Love is the only way.

599
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,834
There was a young Roman boy, Tarquin.

600
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,716
He was killed in the streets last night.

601
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,995
He was beloved by the community.

602
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,750
Most of them trust the Way.

603
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,519
But he has this cousin who is...

604
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,160
He's dividing them, Paul.

605
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,279
This growing faction
of young men that...

606
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,876
They want to retaliate.

607
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,429
They want revenge.

608
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:28,275
We cannot repay evil for evil.

609
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,840
Evil can only be overcome with good.

610
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,510
Well, considering
all they've been through,

611
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:46,117
can you really fault
their response, Paul?

612
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,832
What did you tell them?

613
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,796
Love is the only way.

614
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:57,034
And after all you've seen,

615
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,795
you still don't believe it?

616
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,396
This isn't anything I've seen.

617
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,473
My God...

618
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,391
This is a world in the grip of evil.

619
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,318
This is Nero's circus.

620
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,511
It's passionate hate.

621
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,557
Blood washing down the street,

622
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,677
widows, orphans starving to death.

623
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,911
Babies born with the slightest defect

624
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,310
are disposed, dispatched, discarded.

625
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,869
This world

626
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,520
doesn't know a thing about love.

627
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,193
And so you would give up
on the world when Christ

628
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,192
- did not give up on us?
- Why not?

629
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,760
- No!
- Why not?

630
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,991
Love is the only way.

631
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,872
Love that suffers long.

632
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,237
Love that is kind,

633
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,559
that does not envy, that is not proud.

634
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:56,432
Love that does not dishonor,

635
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,672
that does not seek for itself.

636
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,478
Love that is not easily angered.

637
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,832
Love that rejoices in truth.

638
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,390
Love that never delights in evil.

639
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,315
Love that protects,

640
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,835
trusts, hopes,

641
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,640
endures all things.

642
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,590
That kind of love.

643
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,712
Give me your hand.

644
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,110
Do you understand?

645
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,916
Then write it down.

646
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,471
<i>I once wanted vengeance,</i>

647
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,394
<i>like Cassius and these young men.</i>

648
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,838
<i>I know this path of destruction
more than anyone.</i>

649
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,110
<i>I hated those that followed Christ.</i>

650
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:24,151
<i>I hunted them down like wild animals.</i>

651
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:31,711
<i>And when they fled Jerusalem,</i>

652
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:34,838
<i>I went to the temple
to the chief priests,</i>

653
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:38,675
<i>to obtain authority to go to Damascus</i>

654
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,518
<i>and arrest all those
that followed the Way.</i>

655
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:46,630
<i>I was determined
to be God's hand ofjustice.</i>

656
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,592
<i>His wrath.</i>

657
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,397
You believed what you were doing

658
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,631
was out of a love for God.

659
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,719
A blind love.

660
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,039
I only knew the law.

661
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,520
If water flows

662
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,512
down a mountain,
what besides a miracle

663
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,432
could cause it to flow back?

664
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,278
The road to Damascus was

665
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,951
your miracle.

666
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,952
<i>Yes.</i>

667
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,874
<i>The road to Damascus.</i>

668
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,790
<i>Saul... Saul...</i>

669
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:26,113
<i>Why do you persecute me?</i>

670
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,636
<i>Who are you, Lord?</i>

671
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,230
<i>Who are you, Lord?</i>

672
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,832
<i>I am Jesus,</i>

673
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,396
<i>whom you are persecuting.</i>

674
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,239
What's going on? What happened?

675
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,959
He can't see.

676
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,759
Here. Lay him here.

677
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,832
Something... Something
happened on the road.

678
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,274
Something like a light.

679
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,477
There was a voice, a voice like...

680
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,153
Like thunder.

681
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:58,392
He fell to his knees,
as if he were struck down.

682
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,790
And he was shouting out the words...

683
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,792
"Who are you, Lord?"

684
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,191
All the way here
he has been saying aloud

685
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:09,114
that Jesus is the Messiah.

686
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,991
Saul of Tarsus,

687
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,197
can you hear me?

688
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,471
Ananias?

689
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,632
You know who I am?

690
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,360
The Lord showed me a vision
that you would come to me.

691
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,672
They tell me

692
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,150
you have lost your mind,

693
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:47,278
that you haven't eaten
or had anything to drink

694
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:50,558
in three days.

695
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,872
Your actions against
those that follow Christ

696
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:57,795
and all the harm
you have done

697
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:00,759
is well reported.

698
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:05,312
I know you have come here on
authority of the chief priests

699
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:09,394
to arrest all those
who call on the Lord's name.

700
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,916
I am a wretched man.

701
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,390
I deserve death.

702
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:28,834
Yes.

703
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,199
We all do.

704
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,073
Yet,

705
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,513
Christ

706
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,318
has set us free.

707
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,239
Brother Saul,

708
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,032
the Lord Jesus,

709
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:56,597
who appeared to you on the road
as you were coming here,

710
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:02,753
has sent me
so that you may see again

711
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,718
and be filled

712
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:08,396
with the Holy Spirit.

713
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,151
Brother Saul,

714
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,830
receive thy sight.

715
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:08,677
Everything in your life changed,

716
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,911
yet you continued on.

717
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,800
Three years in Arabia.

718
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,280
Why?

719
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,154
Peter and the others spent
three years with Christ.

720
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,918
I had to do the same.

721
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:32,918
I had to learn how to pray,

722
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,719
how to speak.

723
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,911
How to love.

724
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,560
All right, old man.

725
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,311
Tell me everything that followed.

726
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:54,598
Prisoner, on your feet.

727
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,559
The Greek, too.

728
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,235
Sir.

729
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,920
A chair, perhaps?

730
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,793
I will stand.

731
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:17,233
I recognize the way you stand,

732
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,797
like a man who has been
flogged repeatedly.

733
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,395
They say the spine bends
and does not heal properly.

734
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:27,476
Am I correct?

735
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,389
You are correct.

736
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,960
I am sure you are aware
of the responsibility I have

737
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,919
for the detainment of
every prisoner in this place.

738
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:41,872
I am well aware that to lose a prisoner
means death for you and your men.

739
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:43,710
Exactly.

740
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:47,354
Then you understand
my current concern.

741
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,797
Prefect, do you think
that we are plotting an escape?

742
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,231
Well, a man who has been
charged with burning down Rome

743
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:58,199
meets in secret with a Greek
for all hours of the night.

744
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,958
Perhaps you're not only
plotting an escape,

745
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,269
but an uprising.

746
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,396
- For what purpose?
- Vengeance.

747
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:11,196
Followers of your cult are being beaten,
raped and killed for sport.

748
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:15,399
It is for the Lord's sake
that we face death all day,

749
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:19,911
that we are considered
as sheep to be slaughtered.

750
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:26,440
Even the sheep will revolt
if whipped hard enough.

751
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:31,716
Do you think that I have
come to Rome against my will?

752
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,793
That I am in this cell by accident?

753
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:40,551
I care very little about the
circumstances of your arrival.

754
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,678
I am concerned with these documents

755
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:47,511
that are being generated
in the very heart of my prison.

756
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,279
So, depending on my finding,
I will determine what should be done.

757
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,751
Consider the Greek a threat
to Rome until proven otherwise.

758
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,555
Put him in the dark with the preacher.

759
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,793
She's not improving.

760
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,400
Whatever the cost, I'd pay for it.

761
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,073
It's not an issue of cost.

762
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,992
It's an issue
of whatever this illness is.

763
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:21,912
I have never seen
anything like this before.

764
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,400
Please.

765
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:49,633
- I understand your pain, Cassius.
- Understand?

766
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,359
- Don't say you understand.
- But Christ spoke of love

767
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,840
- and peace and patience.
- You understand nothing.

768
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,036
- You respond in the flesh.
- People are dying

769
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,560
every day because of us.

770
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,233
I've lost my whole family!

771
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,312
- Family? You speak of family?
- Yes. My family.

772
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,119
You listen to me!
I still have my family,

773
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,554
and I will not put their lives at risk

774
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:03,960
- for a foolish plan!
- You coward!

775
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,315
Just think of your family!

776
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,551
- No! No! No!
- What would you do, then?

777
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:08,994
No! Keep your voice down!

778
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:10,878
Luke has been thrown into prison.

779
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,155
- What?
- On conspiracy.

780
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,390
What did you say?

781
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:16,075
Luke has been thrown into prison.

782
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,913
And I've gathered men willing to storm
that prison and free them.

783
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,196
- To what end, Cassius?
- Justice.

784
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,272
Justice?

785
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,517
Think of how foolish
Nero will look having lost the man

786
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:29,320
- he accused of burning down Rome.
- No.

787
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,677
If you're caught,
they'll come here for us all.

788
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,194
- Listen to me. Please.
- Exactly.

789
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,239
Listen to me! We can align ourselves

790
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:40,234
with these powerful families
to overthrow Nero.

791
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:43,280
And we can bring peace to Rome
if we rule it.

792
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:46,876
Christ asked us to care
for the world, not rule it.

793
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,120
Listen closely.

794
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,637
All of you, listen to me closely.

795
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:57,194
Some of you may want
to stay in the city...

796
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:59,875
And some of you may want to leave.

797
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,631
But if any of you...

798
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,795
Any of you take up arms,

799
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,873
you have no place in this community.

800
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:21,278
Cassius and the others
have finally calmed down.

801
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,633
I can't stop thinking about Tarquin.

802
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,199
The poor boy.

803
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:34,195
We sent him out there, Aquila.

804
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,077
I know. I blame myself.

805
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,431
I should have taken it.

806
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,557
We've lost so many, Priscilla.

807
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,439
I can't bear the thought
of losing any more.

808
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:51,512
I believe it's time to leave Rome
with the knowledge that we could be

809
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:54,240
better protected and serve elsewhere.

810
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:59,194
I pray that God works good through it.

811
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:04,636
And I pray that you'll forgive me,

812
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:10,675
because I believe that God is
calling us to different paths.

813
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,912
I know, I know...

814
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,799
I know you love this city, its people.

815
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,600
That's part of you. I understand.

816
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,630
I give you my blessing.

817
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,592
I must say...

818
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:47,710
I preferred the visits
to that charming rented villa

819
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:50,440
the last time
you were imprisoned in Rome

820
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:52,273
instead of this lovely hellhole.

821
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,196
Do you ever miss the road?

822
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,879
You must be kidding.

823
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,871
You know I had a great life
before I met you.

824
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:10,399
Your unwavering commitment

825
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:14,394
kept me going on many
of those cold, miserable nights

826
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,233
in the wilderness,

827
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,596
bellies rumbling,

828
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:21,070
feet and back in terrible pain.

829
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:30,796
You used to sing those awful songs
in the middle of the night.

830
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,517
Excuse me, but they were
from my childhood,

831
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:37,953
and I told you time and again, it's the
only thing that puts me to sleep.

832
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:41,758
Your pitch sounded even higher
than Timothy's mother.

833
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,473
We never met.

834
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,399
Was she that good
of a singer as well?

835
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,238
And Peter's snoring.

836
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:52,677
- We won't miss that.
- We won't miss that.

837
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:59,439
They truly were

838
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:02,355
miserable days being with you.

839
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,798
I do miss them.

840
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,035
Praise God that he put you
into my life, brother.

841
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:18,158
I don't know where I'd be without you.

842
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:21,675
Well, from malaria to blood loss,

843
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:24,275
you would be most certainly dead.

844
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,036
Luke, no.

845
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,717
It's quite boring.

846
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:51,433
Just a man walking around
giving very lengthy speeches.

847
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:57,080
The only exciting bit is
the stoning of this fellow.

848
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,632
Mauritius...

849
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,992
I have heard outrageous rumors
about this man.

850
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:06,839
A sorcerer of the dark arts,

851
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,912
a charmer of snakes and demons,

852
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,071
a man capable of healing the crippled

853
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:13,117
with just a touch of his cloak.

854
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:15,520
A healer?

855
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,751
No, my point, you don't make
a man your leader

856
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,752
just because he trips
and falls in the road

857
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:22,833
and then travels around a bit and

858
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,832
says a few things.

859
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:27,389
There must be more to the story.

860
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:33,673
You need to get him
to confess something.

861
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:38,278
What else would he say that he
hasn't already spoken at his trial?

862
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:42,030
A man on trial will say whatever
he can to save his hide.

863
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:45,796
But he has been convicted.
He will be executed.

864
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:48,190
No man wants to leave this life
without a legacy,

865
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:51,398
without boasting
of his own glorious deeds

866
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:54,080
so the world can remember him forever.

867
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:57,395
Appeal to his arrogance.

868
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,194
Perhaps.

869
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:06,480
I come here to find some peace.

870
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:09,791
You cannot see any of Rome.

871
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:13,599
You cannot see what has become
of this great city.

872
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:20,112
I misjudged you.

873
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,830
You are much more of a soldier
than a preacher.

874
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:27,711
A man with a great deal
of blood on his hands.

875
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,152
Sins of a past life,

876
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,637
by God's grace washed away.

877
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,992
Sin, grace, mercy.

878
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:40,236
Your philosophical scribblings
tell me nothing

879
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:43,831
about why the Christians look
to you as their leader

880
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:48,394
and why Nero singled you out
as the chief enemy of Rome.

881
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:51,234
I think you already know the truth,

882
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:54,873
that we were not responsible
for the fires.

883
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:59,037
Why does Nero bring
this accusation upon you?

884
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:02,431
Rumors abound in the streets
about your powers.

885
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:05,232
Perhaps it is these supernatural things

886
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:08,040
that are seen as such a threat by Nero.

887
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,033
I have no powers.

888
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,032
Then the stories are not true?

889
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:15,396
They are all true.

890
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:20,476
So why do your people boast
about your powers?

891
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:24,597
I've never said these things
in my life to boast.

892
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:27,271
I boast only of my weaknesses,

893
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,719
so that God's power may rest on me.

894
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,192
Very few men admit weakness.

895
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:40,397
Certainly none boast of it.

896
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:43,836
I boast of it gladly,

897
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:46,631
for this power is sown in weakness.

898
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,957
I assume you have earned riches.

899
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,190
Land.

900
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:54,319
Influence amongst your people.

901
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:58,311
Maybe it is what has roused
Nero's jealousy.

902
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:01,759
I've never taken a single coin
for my work for Christ.

903
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,115
Really?

904
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,431
The good news of salvation is free.

905
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:08,671
It was given to me freely,

906
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:11,589
and I give it away for free.

907
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:13,873
So you have certain powers,

908
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:16,839
but claim to have no authority
to use them.

909
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:20,751
You've done miraculous things,
yet do not boast for glory.

910
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,799
You make no wages for your work.

911
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:27,120
You're sounding less like
a leader and more like a slave.

912
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,795
A slave that has been set free.

913
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:32,794
We're Romans.
We're already free men.

914
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,834
All men are a slave to something.

915
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:46,360
That Greek,

916
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,756
he is risking his life
for you.

917
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:51,115
Why?

918
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:56,433
He believes people should know
the certainties of my life.

919
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:06,717
My daughter is sick.

920
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:12,474
If I pray to your Christ,
your God, will she be healed?

921
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,513
I don't know.

922
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:18,079
His ways are not my ways.

923
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,595
So you offer nothing.

924
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:24,720
I offer the truth of salvation
that has been set on my heart.

925
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:29,353
The Greek can take his papers.
I see no value in them.

926
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:31,554
He'll be released tomorrow.

927
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:32,869
Prefect Mauritius.

928
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:36,636
The Greek, Luke,

929
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:40,036
he is a great physician.

930
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:43,196
His talents are unmatched.

931
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,479
No.

932
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:54,434
I would not anger the gods
by bringing a Christian into my home.

933
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:08,472
I said that you
could help his daughter.

934
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:14,718
How could I bring healing when he
and Rome bring so much suffering?

935
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:19,594
You know this man
even better than I do.

936
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:21,354
You

937
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:24,229
used to pray to the gods of Greece,

938
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:27,710
just as he does the gods of Rome.

939
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:31,195
In your account of the Lord,
why did you write so often

940
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,237
of the poor

941
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:36,839
and the outcasts and foreigners?

942
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:46,155
I guess I wanted others
to understand

943
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:51,032
God's kingdom is open to us all,

944
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:53,840
that his mercy is for everyone.

945
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,120
Exactly.

946
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,599
We can never forget
what it was like to be lost.

947
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:01,919
And to be found.

948
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:04,192
Do not worry, brother.

949
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:06,959
When the moment comes,

950
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,999
you will have the strength
to do what is right.

951
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:15,276
Where sin abounds,

952
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:18,480
grace abounds more.

953
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:42,953
- There's nothing more I can do.
- How is that possible?

954
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:46,598
I have spoken with others.
No one has answers.

955
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:50,118
And she's not responding
to anything I have tried.

956
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:52,239
I have no more ideas.

957
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:53,993
Think of something else.

958
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:58,159
Make another sacrifice.

959
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:00,836
Plead to the gods for her life.

960
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:04,472
Take heed, Mauritius,
you are a good man.

961
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,993
The gods can still hear you
and heal her.

962
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:44,558
You missed the doctor.

963
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:50,917
You have been telling me
to get out for fresh air,

964
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,753
so I... So I got out.

965
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,798
There is nothing else he can do.

966
01:08:58,120 --> 01:08:59,713
I had no doubt.

967
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:03,874
We should not speak here.

968
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:08,199
Do you fear that which the gods
might hear you speak?

969
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:13,838
And here you accuse me
of angering the gods,

970
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:15,440
but what of you?

971
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:20,154
There is gossip amongst
the wives of the guards

972
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,391
that you treat this man of Tarsus,

973
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:26,030
who spits in the face of Rome,
with a degree of sympathy.

974
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:28,476
He's a Roman citizen.

975
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:32,359
If there is any degree of kindness,
it's because of that.

976
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:36,474
What kindness
is harboring a Greek Christian

977
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:39,951
against a direct order
of your emperor?

978
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:43,272
You should be tried
and executed for conspiracy.

979
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:46,797
And yet you think that I anger the gods!

980
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:50,593
I harbor the Greek, because
the husbands of these gossips

981
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:52,433
were paid to look after him.

982
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:54,432
Your daughter is dying,

983
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:57,479
and you dare dishonor the gods
by your actions?

984
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:01,716
All these years,
I have been loyal to you.

985
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:03,799
While you were gone!

986
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,551
While you were away
on your campaigns.

987
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:09,275
You don't think I was lonely?

988
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:14,197
You don't think
I was starved of affection?

989
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:16,989
I had nothing.

990
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,519
Nothing!

991
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:21,917
And then she was born...

992
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:25,275
That precious baby girl.

993
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:30,194
And she was my...

994
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:32,112
My joy.

995
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:37,472
She was my life
while you were gone.

996
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:41,430
But now you threaten
to take away my joy,

997
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:46,197
my life away from me, because you refuse
to look at your own selfish ways!

998
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:49,918
- This is not my fault.
- It is all your fault!

999
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:52,880
By witness to all the gods,
I say that her death

1000
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:55,680
- will be on your head.
- Enough!

1001
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,678
Do it.

1002
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:02,954
Save me the trouble
for when she dies.

1003
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:06,518
Halt!

1004
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:16,191
This way. Quickly.
Down the corridor. Go!

1005
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:20,913
Please! I beg of you!

1006
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:22,636
Free us!

1007
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:24,439
Brothers, save us!

1008
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:31,350
Down here!

1009
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:35,714
Quickly. We've come to release you.

1010
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:37,910
Who sent you?

1011
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:39,440
We come in the name of Christ.

1012
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:43,275
You bring violence against government
officials in the name of Christ?

1013
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:46,353
The moment arises to overthrow
this cursed power

1014
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:47,430
and return it to the people.

1015
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:50,080
By whose authority
do you think Rome has power?

1016
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:51,435
You will die here.

1017
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:53,953
And your cause will die with you.

1018
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:57,954
Christ has already triumphed
over every enemy by the cross.

1019
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:00,677
You say you come in his name,

1020
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:03,749
but it is clear you do not know him.

1021
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:06,230
Cassius, we have to go. Now.

1022
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:07,670
Fools.

1023
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:36,712
- Check the prisoners.
- Yes, sir.

1024
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:50,193
So, this is how my kindness is repaid?

1025
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:54,597
My prison broken into.

1026
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:58,638
My guards killed.

1027
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:00,516
There will always be those

1028
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:03,957
that try and take justice
into their own hands.

1029
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:06,471
You do not take any responsibility?

1030
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:08,474
If we were responsible,

1031
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:12,072
wouldn't you be in that cell
awaiting your own execution?

1032
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:15,994
How can it be that by words alone,

1033
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:19,356
you spit in the face of the Emperor?

1034
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:22,798
By words alone,
you seem to defy Rome itself.

1035
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:26,833
Words do not threaten
to destroy empires.

1036
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,998
Because perhaps
they are not just words,

1037
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,717
they are the truth of things.

1038
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:37,317
You keep saying "truth." "Truth."

1039
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:41,000
But it's only a truth according to you.

1040
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:44,996
If it were the only truth,
everyone would believe it.

1041
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,309
Not so.

1042
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:49,152
Christ, who is truth,
rose from the dead.

1043
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:51,118
Many still do not believe.

1044
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:52,669
Lies. Fabrications.

1045
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:58,000
If Christ had not risen from the dead,
then our preaching is useless,

1046
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,799
and so is our faith.

1047
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:03,839
And you have no doubts at all?

1048
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:08,440
Men do not die for things they doubt.

1049
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:14,151
You claim you serve a god
who is above all other gods,

1050
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:17,273
and yet all I see before me
is an old man in chains.

1051
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:24,715
Your life, a summary of beatings
and filthy prison cells.

1052
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,959
I deserve worse, but...

1053
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:33,032
There is grace enough for everyone.

1054
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:34,914
To be rich,

1055
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:36,914
not poor.

1056
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:39,913
To be powerful,

1057
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:41,515
not weak.

1058
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:43,757
To have slaves and servants, not be one.

1059
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:45,320
It does not take an intelligent man

1060
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:48,757
to look around and know that
the world is missing something.

1061
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:50,912
Do not question the greatness of Rome.

1062
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:53,072
And what of the love
for a sick daughter?

1063
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:54,230
What does Rome offer her?

1064
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:00,229
Another word and I send you
to whatever god you want.

1065
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:13,239
You're right, my daughter is dying.

1066
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:17,877
The gods do not answer me.

1067
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:20,838
There is another way.

1068
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:25,870
No. There is not.

1069
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:28,393
Your Christ solves nothing.

1070
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:31,036
Mindless sentimentality
for the weakest and poorest

1071
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:33,271
to make their
pathetic state livable

1072
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:37,712
until they are buried
in the ground and forgotten.

1073
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:39,994
Tomorrow there are games at the circus.

1074
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:42,754
Take the Greek there,

1075
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:46,278
- so he can die for the glory of my gods!
- No!

1076
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,593
And may this give me favor
for my daughter.

1077
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:49,716
No!

1078
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:51,519
Luke. Luke!

1079
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:55,034
You should have escaped
when you had the chance!

1080
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:02,354
And show the man from Tarsus
how Rome treats its enemies.

1081
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:35,633
Help us finish the race, Father.

1082
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:52,076
Cassius and the others have disappeared.

1083
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:54,759
The city is on alert.

1084
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:57,478
How could they do this?

1085
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:00,351
They're putting everyone at risk.

1086
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:04,994
Confused, selfish young men
with their own ambitions.

1087
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,400
I would not expect them to return.

1088
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:15,271
But Luke will die in the morning

1089
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:19,396
along with our brothers and sisters.

1090
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:24,797
I only wanted to help this city.

1091
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:28,752
Now there's nothing but
the stench of death around us.

1092
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:34,600
How many more would have died
without you here?

1093
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:42,636
My heart breaks for Rome.

1094
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:49,114
I know I can't help everyone,
but Christ has asked us to try.

1095
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,551
I do want to stay here.

1096
01:18:57,960 --> 01:18:59,952
But we're stronger together.

1097
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,114
I know you.

1098
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:28,191
You're the one traveled with Paul.

1099
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,110
Luke, the physician.

1100
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:34,556
I am.

1101
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:37,711
Do you know what will happen to us?

1102
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:40,672
They tell us nothing in here.

1103
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:52,755
There will be games tomorrow.

1104
01:19:57,640 --> 01:20:00,030
Everyone, gather around.

1105
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:02,750
- Gather around.
- Come. Come.

1106
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:08,840
It will be a moment of pain.

1107
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:12,514
But only a moment.

1108
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:15,599
Only a moment.

1109
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:18,069
And then we shall be home

1110
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:21,437
in the presence of
our Lord Jesus Christ forever.

1111
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:23,479
You see, in my heart,

1112
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,752
I felt that there should be some kind
of retribution against the Romans

1113
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:31,036
for the crimes that they have committed.

1114
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:36,158
But there can be only one way.

1115
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:40,240
Remember as our Lord
spoke from the cross.

1116
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:48,476
"Father, forgive them,
for they know not what they do."

1117
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:54,753
He has also asked us
to pray in the same way.

1118
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:58,113
So, let us pray.

1119
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:01,520
- Our Father...
- Our Father...

1120
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:03,080
...who art in heaven,

1121
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:05,152
hallowed be thy name,

1122
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:11,114
thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on Earth as it is in heaven.

1123
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:13,830
Give us this day our daily bread,

1124
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,231
and forgive us our debts

1125
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:21,351
as we forgive our debtors.

1126
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,549
And lead us not into temptation,

1127
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:27,392
but deliver us from evil.

1128
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:30,559
Amen.

1129
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:24,993
Please save her.

1130
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:26,750
I can't lose her.

1131
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:30,236
Whatever it takes. Please.

1132
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:38,352
Bring the Greek here. Now!

1133
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:39,635
Yes, sir.

1134
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:51,440
Can you save her?

1135
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:04,673
Quickly, give me your knife.

1136
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:08,995
Now.

1137
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:11,359
Your daughter's chest
is filling with blood.

1138
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:15,036
If I do not drain it, she will die.
Your knife, please.

1139
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,154
Thank you.

1140
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:27,394
Give me your hand.

1141
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:30,191
Pen and parchment, please.

1142
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:40,795
You will find Aquila and Priscilla here.

1143
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:44,718
Tell them I sent you here
for these things.

1144
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:47,440
And they must be brought back
to me immediately.

1145
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:51,876
I believe I know
what's wrong with her.

1146
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:54,475
It is a sickness I've seen once before
on the island of Rhodes,

1147
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:57,280
but there is much to do
to try and save her life now.

1148
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:02,831
You are trusting me
with your daughter's life

1149
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:07,794
just as I am trusting you
with the lives you see there.

1150
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:11,200
Go now.

1151
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:25,277
No, there is no more bread.

1152
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:34,470
Open the door!
I need to speak to Aquila and Priscilla!

1153
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:37,674
Take the children.

1154
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:39,070
Go, go, go.

1155
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:40,914
Okay.

1156
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:43,399
Open the door! Please!

1157
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,992
Please! Open!

1158
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:53,715
Are you Aquila?

1159
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:10,479
I'm looking for Aquila and Priscilla.

1160
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,717
- Where's Aquila?
- I'm Aquila.

1161
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:20,316
Luke sent me.

1162
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:22,278
- Luke sent you?
- Yes.

1163
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:24,239
I need your help, please.

1164
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:29,430
My daughter is dying. Please. Please.

1165
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:50,919
The Greek is alive.

1166
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,593
Praise God.

1167
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:55,119
Because of him, my daughter lives.

1168
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:57,832
He didn't have to save her.

1169
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:03,760
He sent me to a place for supplies.

1170
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:07,320
It was full of your people hiding out.

1171
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:11,830
He knew I could report them,

1172
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:14,196
have them all thrown
into the circus today.

1173
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:19,794
I am grateful.

1174
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:24,760
My wife, my daughter are grateful.

1175
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:29,120
I only hope it has shown you
something true.

1176
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:36,396
I am sorry for Nero's circus.

1177
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:42,480
I am sorry your people died today.

1178
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:52,720
Have you ever been sailing?

1179
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:55,560
Yes.

1180
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:59,635
Imagine yourself looking out
at the vast sea before you.

1181
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:03,834
You reach down, and you put
a hand into the water,

1182
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:06,111
and you scoop it up towards you.

1183
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:10,072
Immediately, the water starts
leaking through your fingers

1184
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:12,994
until the hand is empty.

1185
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:16,316
That water is a man's life.

1186
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:18,430
From birth to death,

1187
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:22,594
it is always slipping through
our hands until it is gone.

1188
01:30:24,160 --> 01:30:27,278
Along with all that
you hold dear in this world.

1189
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:31,590
And yet the kingdom I speak of,

1190
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:34,799
that I live for,

1191
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:39,792
is like the rest of the water
out in the sea.

1192
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:45,789
Man lives for that cup of water
that slips through his fingers.

1193
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:50,950
But those that follow Jesus Christ

1194
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:55,234
live for that endless expanse of sea.

1195
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:04,511
What if, after all this,

1196
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:07,916
I still do not believe in your Christ?

1197
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:09,992
I wasn't trying to convince you.

1198
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:16,674
Listen to me.

1199
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:19,398
There's only a moment.

1200
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:21,274
It's not me.

1201
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:25,995
It is Christ himself that looks upon you
and shatters your defenses.

1202
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:30,916
And in that moment, you will understand
that you are completely known by God

1203
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:34,833
and you are completely loved.

1204
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:42,394
I will pray that moment comes for you.

1205
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:22,758
I think I would like a walk
to enjoy this sun.

1206
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:25,594
Of course.

1207
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:28,073
You saved his daughter.

1208
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:32,157
They will know us by our love.

1209
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:34,394
This is the Way.

1210
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:39,079
I heard the cheers of the crowd
from the Roman's house.

1211
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:43,072
I shall not forget their faces
for as long as I live.

1212
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:48,398
Trumpets would have sounded
loudest when they arrived home.

1213
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:51,276
A mighty celebration was held today.

1214
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:54,231
A mighty celebration.

1215
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:58,758
If we live, we live for the Lord.

1216
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:01,237
If we die, we die for the Lord.

1217
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:05,713
Whether we live or die,
we belong to the Lord.

1218
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:07,640
That's brilliant.

1219
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:10,193
I now have an ending.

1220
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:12,194
Listen to this. "For two whole years,

1221
01:33:12,280 --> 01:33:15,512
"Paul stayed there in Rome
in his own rented villa."

1222
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:17,512
No. "House."

1223
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:20,116
"And welcomed all who came to see him.

1224
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:21,799
"He proclaimed the kingdom of God

1225
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:25,271
"and taught about our Lord
Jesus Christ with all boldness

1226
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:27,558
"and without hindrance."

1227
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:31,190
There. That should make you sound good.

1228
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:33,918
What of my second arrest?

1229
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:37,675
Of the trial at the Forum,
of Nero's verdict,

1230
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:40,832
of the darkness of my cell?

1231
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:44,832
I have begun my telling of these events

1232
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:47,389
with Jesus' proclamation
to his followers

1233
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:52,354
to bear witness for him in Jerusalem
and to the ends of the Earth.

1234
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:55,678
And the story that began
in Jerusalem 30 years ago

1235
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:58,152
has now come to Rome.

1236
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:03,712
So, this is the end.

1237
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:12,750
And yet death is only the beginning.

1238
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:17,196
We will meet again on a new road.
Of that I am certain.

1239
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:21,316
To live is Christ,

1240
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:25,879
to die is gain.

1241
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:31,672
I like that one.

1242
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:35,599
Write it down.

1243
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:43,720
We're doing well.

1244
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:45,918
Over a hundred copies so far.

1245
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,880
We will take these with us out of Rome
and bring them to all the communities.

1246
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:52,312
It will help many people.

1247
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:06,032
Thank you. Thank you.

1248
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:10,150
Luke.

1249
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:11,794
What will you do?

1250
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:13,439
I can't abandon Paul now.

1251
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:15,116
Once we're gone,

1252
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:17,510
I can't guarantee
your safe exit from Rome.

1253
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:19,796
Aquila, you've already done
more than enough.

1254
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:23,837
I feel that my finishing this work
is most important.

1255
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:27,399
I guess there are some things
in life worth risking.

1256
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:31,440
I shall miss you both.

1257
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:36,269
Here. Paul has asked
that you would make sure

1258
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:38,238
this letter reaches Timothy immediately.

1259
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:40,118
Of course. Of course.

1260
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:41,600
Do not be afraid.

1261
01:35:50,040 --> 01:35:53,317
<i>"To Timothy, my dear son.</i>

1262
