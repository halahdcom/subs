00:03:57,402 --> 00:03:59,335
Hi.

3
00:03:59,337 --> 00:04:01,471
Look, I don't know
what you want me to say.

4
00:04:01,473 --> 00:04:02,739
Could start
with "thank you".

5
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:05,409
Thanks... for
picking me up.

6
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,580
"Sorry" would
be nice.

7
00:04:20,992 --> 00:04:22,591
You're smoking again.

8
00:04:22,593 --> 00:04:25,027
Yeah, I'm
smoking again.

9
00:04:25,029 --> 00:04:27,666
Not around
him, Max.

10
00:04:37,642 --> 00:04:39,343
You look good.

11
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:42,111
I'm eating good,
I'm not drinking,

12
00:04:42,113 --> 00:04:46,382
I'm not smoking...
nothing.

13
00:04:46,384 --> 00:04:48,784
Please tell me you
learned your lesson.

14
00:04:48,786 --> 00:04:50,486
I learned
lots of lessons.

15
00:04:50,488 --> 00:04:52,555
I learned how
to make a shiv.

16
00:04:52,557 --> 00:04:54,791
Turns out prison has
arts & crafts time.

17
00:04:54,793 --> 00:04:56,829
It's not funny.

18
00:05:03,802 --> 00:05:05,702
How is he?

19
00:05:05,704 --> 00:05:11,108
He's good. Yeah.
He's good.

20
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,810
That's good. Thanks
for not bringing him.

21
00:05:13,812 --> 00:05:15,478
Well, he's
got school.

22
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,579
He's in school?

23
00:05:16,581 --> 00:05:17,947
Mm hm,
preschool.

24
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:19,649
Preschool?

25
00:05:19,651 --> 00:05:21,687
Yep, he says
he's a big kid now.

26
00:05:27,692 --> 00:05:29,659
What, so this is
what you listen to now?

27
00:05:29,661 --> 00:05:31,527
Yeah, it's
only been a year.

28
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:33,462
A year, a month,
and nine days.

29
00:05:33,464 --> 00:05:34,930
But who's counting?

30
00:05:34,932 --> 00:05:36,966
Yeah, and not much has
changed since then,

31
00:05:36,968 --> 00:05:38,468
it's just music.

32
00:05:40,105 --> 00:05:43,539
Really? Did they
come play for you

33
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,574
during your
stint in Folsom?

34
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:26,419
Oh!

35
00:06:45,137 --> 00:06:46,902
Max?

36
00:06:46,904 --> 00:06:48,204
Max, look at me.

37
00:06:48,206 --> 00:06:50,240
Look at
me, Max.

38
00:06:50,242 --> 00:06:51,477
Max...

39
00:07:02,653 --> 00:07:04,053
Sorry.

40
00:07:04,055 --> 00:07:06,789
It's fine.

41
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:11,194
No, it wasn't.
It sucked.

42
00:07:11,196 --> 00:07:13,433
It was fine.

43
00:08:08,987 --> 00:08:12,255
Do you want
anything?

44
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:17,497
Okay.

45
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:36,278
This is a
missing person.

46
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,781
Have you
seen him?

47
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:39,583
Bigfoot
got 'im!

48
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:41,117
He's coming
'round again.

49
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:42,319
Yeah, right.

50
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:45,220
Hairy, ape-man
bastard.

51
00:08:45,222 --> 00:08:47,656
You and your kind
ain't foolin' me

52
00:08:47,658 --> 00:08:50,660
with your wampum,
your Oh-Mah,

53
00:08:50,662 --> 00:08:53,162
and your mystic
injun horseshit!

54
00:08:53,164 --> 00:08:57,166
Nickel Pete, if you see
him you give me a call.

55
00:08:57,168 --> 00:08:58,634
Yeah, I'll
do that.

56
00:08:58,636 --> 00:08:59,938
Thank you.

57
00:09:01,907 --> 00:09:03,607
You're all
in on it...

58
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:05,675
Try the
fuckin' donuts.

59
00:09:05,677 --> 00:09:07,113
Bigfoot lovers.

60
00:09:14,318 --> 00:09:16,151
Hey...

61
00:09:16,153 --> 00:09:18,021
big, hairy bastard.

62
00:09:18,023 --> 00:09:18,854
Sorry?

63
00:09:18,856 --> 00:09:20,857
Giant, hairy,
mohawk motherfucker

64
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:22,324
coming
'round again...

65
00:09:22,326 --> 00:09:24,294
him and his big
ol' fuckin' feet.

66
00:09:24,296 --> 00:09:26,095
Gonna getcha!
Ha ha ha!

67
00:09:26,097 --> 00:09:28,233
Yeah, sure as shit.
Twenty dollars.

68
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:35,975
Have a nice day.

69
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:48,987
That's what I'm
talking 'bout.

70
00:09:51,255 --> 00:09:55,090
Hey! Put it in your
pants, ya pervert!

71
00:09:55,092 --> 00:09:56,425
Hey!

72
00:09:56,427 --> 00:09:58,798
Okay,
alright. Ow!

73
00:10:00,131 --> 00:10:02,065
Well, well...

74
00:10:02,067 --> 00:10:03,867
Boo!!

75
00:10:05,336 --> 00:10:06,869
Convict.

76
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:08,405
Ex-convict.

77
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:11,907
Woo hoo hoo! I'm
shakin' in my boots!

78
00:10:14,745 --> 00:10:16,182
Are you done?

79
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:38,204
Got you some, uh,
healthy trail mix.

80
00:10:42,774 --> 00:10:45,874
Really? You've been
out an hour and you

81
00:10:45,876 --> 00:10:48,011
already got me on
an open container.

82
00:10:48,013 --> 00:10:49,845
Ashley, it's
just a beer.

83
00:10:49,847 --> 00:10:51,381
No! It's a Class
2 misdemeanor

84
00:10:51,383 --> 00:10:53,416
'cause I already
got one, remember?

85
00:10:53,418 --> 00:10:57,219
I guess you didn't
learn a goddamn thing.

86
00:10:57,221 --> 00:10:58,887
I learned
plenty, actually.

87
00:10:58,889 --> 00:11:00,790
I learned that
when making a shiv

88
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:03,193
you've gotta taper and
serrate the blade...

89
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:05,494
otherwise you're
just poppin' people

90
00:11:05,496 --> 00:11:07,397
with needles and
that's just something

91
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,331
they're used to. But
when the time is right,

92
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,200
the only thing that
you have to do is

93
00:11:11,202 --> 00:11:13,302
aim for the sweet spot,
just right in the kidney.

94
00:11:13,304 --> 00:11:14,270
Enough!

95
00:11:14,272 --> 00:11:15,905
Then <i>you</i>
say something.

96
00:11:15,907 --> 00:11:18,074
You say something to
make all this good again.

97
00:11:18,076 --> 00:11:21,411
Because you didn't
say a goddamn thing

98
00:11:21,413 --> 00:11:23,448
when I was sitting
in handcuffs...

99
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:26,449
You know...

100
00:11:26,451 --> 00:11:28,984
you weren't much
better than me, Ashley.

101
00:11:28,986 --> 00:11:31,488
Not much, but at
least I was better.

102
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,323
And I'm clean
now, courtesy

103
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:35,291
of the Department
of Corrections.

104
00:11:35,293 --> 00:11:36,124
Congratulations!

105
00:11:36,126 --> 00:11:37,893
I'm glad they
could do it for you

106
00:11:37,895 --> 00:11:40,063
but your wife and son
weren't worth enough.

107
00:11:40,065 --> 00:11:42,968
For a year, a
month, and nine days

108
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,768
I have been planning
this exact moment.

109
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,503
I'm just
fucking it up.

110
00:11:47,505 --> 00:11:49,973
How could you fuck
this up? It's me.

111
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:52,776
This is me.
This is us.

112
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:56,845
What? What?
Say it.

113
00:11:56,847 --> 00:11:58,080
I'm scared.

114
00:11:58,082 --> 00:12:01,184
Right now in
this moment...

115
00:12:01,186 --> 00:12:03,853
I'm scared.

116
00:12:03,855 --> 00:12:05,821
You're scared?

117
00:12:05,823 --> 00:12:08,126
I'm scared
shitless.

118
00:12:10,028 --> 00:12:11,330
Good answer.

119
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,507
Shit! What
was that?

120
00:13:09,888 --> 00:13:11,286
Oh, my God.

121
00:13:11,288 --> 00:13:13,488
He's not moving.

122
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,324
What happened
to him?

123
00:13:15,326 --> 00:13:18,094
Where did he come from?
What was he doing?

124
00:13:18,096 --> 00:13:20,095
I don't know.

125
00:13:20,097 --> 00:13:22,098
But our car
didn't do all that.

126
00:13:23,268 --> 00:13:24,467
Oh, my God!

127
00:13:31,475 --> 00:13:33,979
I'm going to
get my phone.

128
00:13:38,182 --> 00:13:39,415
Ashley!

129
00:13:39,417 --> 00:13:42,384
Ashley... Ashley!

130
00:13:42,386 --> 00:13:45,354
Ashley, wait. There's
beer all over the car.

131
00:13:45,356 --> 00:13:46,323
We just hit
this guy.

132
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,324
Yeah, there's no way
we did all that, Max.

133
00:13:48,326 --> 00:13:49,959
That was
not just us.

134
00:13:49,961 --> 00:13:51,094
Jesus, Ash!

135
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:52,661
Just got out.
Party of one?

136
00:13:52,663 --> 00:13:55,598
Don't do this to me.
Think about us.

137
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,667
Ashley, please.

138
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:04,907
Yeah, hello?
I'm on Hwy 23

139
00:14:04,909 --> 00:14:07,209
about 25 miles
north of state prison.

140
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:09,344
There's been
an accident.

141
00:14:09,346 --> 00:14:13,215
Yes, there's a man
here and he needs help.

142
00:14:13,217 --> 00:14:16,151
Yes, as soon as
possible, please.

143
00:14:16,153 --> 00:14:17,085
Yes.

144
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,353
Max!

145
00:14:20,557 --> 00:14:21,593
Ow!

146
00:14:23,327 --> 00:14:24,963
Oh, my God!

147
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:27,629
Ugh!

148
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:03,632
Max!

149
00:15:03,634 --> 00:15:05,300
Wake up!

150
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:30,560
Max!

151
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:32,228
Wake up!

152
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,947
Max!

153
00:16:28,653 --> 00:16:30,219
Max!

154
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,326
Max!

155
00:17:09,394 --> 00:17:11,126
Max! Max?

156
00:17:11,128 --> 00:17:13,095
Max, wake up!

157
00:17:13,097 --> 00:17:15,198
Wake up, Max.

158
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,798
Wake up!

159
00:17:18,702 --> 00:17:20,536
Max! Max...

160
00:17:22,673 --> 00:17:24,106
Wake up!

161
00:17:24,108 --> 00:17:25,440
Max!

162
00:17:25,442 --> 00:17:30,546
Wake up, Max!

163
00:17:47,731 --> 00:17:49,768
Come on, okay.

164
00:18:00,545 --> 00:18:02,581
Come on,
almost there.

165
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,922
What happened?

166
00:18:13,924 --> 00:18:16,691
You fucking
fell in the water.

167
00:18:18,395 --> 00:18:20,328
You're going into
shock, come here.

168
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:21,730
No, I'm
just cold.

169
00:18:21,732 --> 00:18:23,332
Come on,
sit up.

170
00:18:23,334 --> 00:18:26,371
Come here. I'll
get you warm.

171
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,610
We need to
get you warm.

172
00:18:34,612 --> 00:18:36,648
Come on,
sit up.

173
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,650
Stand up.

174
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,753
Sheriff!

175
00:19:17,755 --> 00:19:18,921
Mrs. Goring.

176
00:19:18,923 --> 00:19:20,422
You find him?

177
00:19:20,424 --> 00:19:22,257
I'm sorry,
not yet.

178
00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:23,859
What are you
gonna do about it?

179
00:19:23,861 --> 00:19:25,527
We're still doing
everything we can

180
00:19:25,529 --> 00:19:26,796
within our means.

181
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:27,764
Bullshit!

182
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:30,999
I want answers now,
or I'll have your job!

183
00:19:31,001 --> 00:19:31,901
Please...

184
00:19:31,903 --> 00:19:35,805
Mrs. Goring, we will
find your husband.

185
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,506
I promise you.

186
00:19:37,508 --> 00:19:38,940
You know
something!

187
00:19:38,942 --> 00:19:42,181
You know something
you're not telling us!

188
00:19:50,421 --> 00:19:52,255
I see Mrs.
G sniped ya.

189
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:53,421
Any luck?

190
00:19:53,423 --> 00:19:54,690
No.

191
00:19:54,692 --> 00:19:56,792
Say, are you
part of this vast

192
00:19:56,794 --> 00:19:59,828
Indian-Bigfoot
conspiracy?

193
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:00,830
Nope.

194
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:04,967
Nickel Pete says I
should know all about it.

195
00:20:04,969 --> 00:20:07,902
Thought I was
missing out on something.

196
00:20:07,904 --> 00:20:09,904
Nickel Pete
might be right.

197
00:20:09,906 --> 00:20:12,775
Maybe there's something
to those Oh-Mah stories.

198
00:20:12,777 --> 00:20:15,378
You're taking sides
with Nickel Pete?

199
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,546
If it means honoring the
traditions, I guess so.

200
00:20:18,548 --> 00:20:21,049
So you're saying you
would call on Nickel Pete

201
00:20:21,051 --> 00:20:23,286
as an expert
reliable witness?

202
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:24,819
Uh, no.

203
00:20:24,821 --> 00:20:27,289
Then what the
hell are you saying?

204
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,959
I'm saying we shouldn't
ignore the Oh-Mah legends

205
00:20:29,961 --> 00:20:31,893
Nickel Pete or
no Nickel Pete.

206
00:20:34,332 --> 00:20:35,864
Sheriff?

207
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:38,467
I think you're
smoking something

208
00:20:38,469 --> 00:20:40,568
other than tobacco
in that peace pipe

209
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,438
bong of
yours, Deputy.

210
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,972
What's this, Nell?

211
00:20:43,974 --> 00:20:46,007
911 call, no
name or nothing.

212
00:20:46,009 --> 00:20:48,710
Aw, Hell's monkeys, I
was just out this way.

213
00:20:48,712 --> 00:20:50,313
Call if you
need backup.

214
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:51,546
Yeah, I will.

215
00:20:51,548 --> 00:20:53,349
I'll use the radio.
Because smoke signals

216
00:20:53,351 --> 00:20:55,351
don't work so
well in the rain.

217
00:20:56,988 --> 00:20:58,853
Don't fall and
break your hip.

218
00:20:58,855 --> 00:21:01,626
You're lucky I
let you wear a gun.

219
00:21:11,368 --> 00:21:12,403
Okay.

220
00:21:15,506 --> 00:21:18,039
Your lighter... I
need your lighter.

221
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,810
Come on,
come on.

222
00:21:34,392 --> 00:21:36,691
Come on... please.

223
00:21:46,636 --> 00:21:48,036
Please... light.

224
00:21:48,038 --> 00:21:49,674
Oh, my God.

225
00:22:06,891 --> 00:22:09,928
Come on,
fire... yes.

226
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,105
Here we go.

227
00:22:24,107 --> 00:22:25,344
Okay.

228
00:22:32,115 --> 00:22:34,353
Okay, we're
almost there.

229
00:22:36,453 --> 00:22:39,490
Okay...

230
00:22:53,971 --> 00:22:56,838
There was an easier way
to get my clothes off.

231
00:22:58,209 --> 00:23:00,112
Not with you.

232
00:23:04,882 --> 00:23:06,015
I'm sorry.

233
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:08,049
It's okay.

234
00:23:08,051 --> 00:23:10,087
I'm so sorry.

235
00:23:25,836 --> 00:23:27,873
What have
we got here?

236
00:24:17,087 --> 00:24:20,122
Nellibell, I'm at the
location of the 911 call

237
00:24:20,124 --> 00:24:23,124
about a hundred yards
north of Marker 23

238
00:24:23,126 --> 00:24:25,294
on the highway.
You call Nelson,

239
00:24:25,296 --> 00:24:27,563
you tell him to get
over here with a winch

240
00:24:27,565 --> 00:24:30,099
and about a hundred
feet of cable ASAP.

241
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:31,600
Lickety-split.

242
00:24:38,075 --> 00:24:40,543
Max: In the morning
we'll set things right,

243
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:42,844
okay? I'll get you
back to Jameson.

244
00:24:42,846 --> 00:24:44,846
Where is Jameson?

245
00:24:44,848 --> 00:24:46,715
He's at mom's.

246
00:24:46,717 --> 00:24:48,551
Poor guy.

247
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:49,584
Stop.

248
00:24:49,586 --> 00:24:50,853
It's worse
than prison.

249
00:24:50,855 --> 00:24:52,054
No.

250
00:24:52,056 --> 00:24:54,222
I didn't know what
was going to happen.

251
00:24:54,224 --> 00:24:56,592
I thought we'd either
be yelling at each other

252
00:24:56,594 --> 00:24:58,126
all night or we'd
be shacked up

253
00:24:58,128 --> 00:25:00,228
in a hotel
room somewhere.

254
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:04,099
Whatever it was,
it wasn't this.

255
00:25:04,101 --> 00:25:05,968
I mean, what's
our next move?

256
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:07,702
What are we
gonna do?

257
00:25:07,704 --> 00:25:09,805
You got me here
to protect you...

258
00:25:09,807 --> 00:25:12,740
defensive prison
techniques and all.

259
00:25:12,742 --> 00:25:14,709
So, this shiv
business...

260
00:25:14,711 --> 00:25:16,812
It's a
legitimate thing.

261
00:25:16,814 --> 00:25:18,713
Who told
you that?

262
00:25:18,715 --> 00:25:20,015
My cellmate.

263
00:25:20,017 --> 00:25:24,987
Legend has it he shanked
about a dozen guys

264
00:25:24,989 --> 00:25:26,755
back in the day.

265
00:25:26,757 --> 00:25:29,024
Please tell me you
didn't shank anyone.

266
00:25:29,026 --> 00:25:31,826
No, I couldn't
hurt anybody else.

267
00:25:31,828 --> 00:25:35,197
Not after all
that's happened.

268
00:25:35,199 --> 00:25:37,833
It was an
accident, Max.

269
00:25:37,835 --> 00:25:42,770
No... no,
it wasn't.

270
00:25:42,772 --> 00:25:46,609
But we'll get
you back, okay?

271
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:50,912
We'll get us back to
Jameson and then we'll,

272
00:25:50,914 --> 00:25:53,349
uh... we'll make sure
everything's alright,

273
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:55,587
okay? I promise.

274
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:03,662
Hey... look at me.

275
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,702
You gotta trust
me, okay?

276
00:26:15,673 --> 00:26:17,709
I trust you.

277
00:26:35,692 --> 00:26:37,729
Let's get this
on the road.

278
00:26:49,906 --> 00:26:52,306
Ashley Carr.

279
00:26:52,308 --> 00:26:55,079
Ashley Carr...

280
00:26:58,982 --> 00:27:02,785
This guy... check with
the prison, find out if

281
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:06,321
they had any inmates
released today.

282
00:28:31,008 --> 00:28:33,542
Max! Where
are you?

283
00:28:33,544 --> 00:28:37,345
Ashley!
What's wrong?

284
00:28:37,347 --> 00:28:39,148
Where are
my clothes?

285
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,150
Aren't they
where you left them?

286
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:43,451
I left them right here,
I didn't touch them.

287
00:28:43,453 --> 00:28:45,520
Well, they have to
be here somewhere.

288
00:28:45,522 --> 00:28:47,221
What is this?

289
00:28:47,223 --> 00:28:48,957
Well, there
are your shoes.

290
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:50,862
What the fuck?!

291
00:28:52,563 --> 00:28:55,463
Take this. Here.

292
00:28:55,465 --> 00:28:57,099
That's it?

293
00:28:57,101 --> 00:28:59,738
I mean, unless you
want my pants, too.

294
00:29:03,106 --> 00:29:04,206
Works for me.

295
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:05,940
Good, I'm glad it
works for someone.

296
00:29:05,942 --> 00:29:08,376
- Alright, let's go.
- Hold on.

297
00:29:08,378 --> 00:29:09,413
Ugh.

298
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:31,165
Ashley: How
are you feeling?

299
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:33,168
Max: Really
good. I mean,

300
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:36,037
my head fuckin' hurts
but the view ain't bad.

301
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:38,076
Well, let's
get home.

302
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:42,244
Come on.
This'll be easy.

303
00:29:42,246 --> 00:29:45,613
We'll just follow
the river back up

304
00:29:45,615 --> 00:29:48,283
to the road, flag
someone down...

305
00:29:48,285 --> 00:29:50,922
It'll be easy.

306
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,932
Shit's Creek,
I presume?

307
00:30:58,955 --> 00:31:01,023
Ashley: My
shoes are wet.

308
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,491
My feet feel like cold
prunes. It sucks!

309
00:31:03,493 --> 00:31:06,161
Max: Well, I've
got wet jeans

310
00:31:06,163 --> 00:31:08,196
and sand in
my crotch...

311
00:31:08,198 --> 00:31:10,599
so it's
chafing my nuts.

312
00:31:10,601 --> 00:31:12,637
You win.

313
00:31:33,123 --> 00:31:34,523
Shh. Do you
hear that?

314
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:35,524
Yeah.

315
00:31:39,596 --> 00:31:41,296
You know
who that is?

316
00:31:41,298 --> 00:31:43,097
Yeah.

317
00:31:43,099 --> 00:31:45,700
Yeah, it's our inbred
hunting buddies

318
00:31:45,702 --> 00:31:47,469
from back at
the gas station.

319
00:31:47,471 --> 00:31:49,270
Unfortunately they're
the only ones that

320
00:31:49,272 --> 00:31:51,472
might have a cell
phone or a radio.

321
00:31:51,474 --> 00:31:54,008
Come on, we
don't have a choice.

322
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:55,142
Great.

323
00:31:55,144 --> 00:31:56,446
Come on.

324
00:31:59,615 --> 00:32:02,284
Maxwell Carr... just
released yesterday.

325
00:32:02,286 --> 00:32:04,286
What was
he in for?

326
00:32:04,288 --> 00:32:05,554
Reckless
endangerment,

327
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:07,221
assault with a
deadly weapon.

328
00:32:07,223 --> 00:32:08,690
His car
hit a kid.

329
00:32:08,692 --> 00:32:10,392
Possession,
substance abuse,

330
00:32:10,394 --> 00:32:12,697
same old stupid
fucking white man.

331
00:32:14,298 --> 00:32:16,131
So... the wife
picks him up,

332
00:32:16,133 --> 00:32:18,702
they crash the
car, and vanish.

333
00:32:22,205 --> 00:32:25,440
So you're telling
me right here

334
00:32:25,442 --> 00:32:27,508
right now to my face
that you actually

335
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:30,144
believe there's an
Oh-Mah out there?

336
00:32:30,146 --> 00:32:32,381
Motherfucking
Bigfoot himself!

337
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:35,316
Abducting white people...
ex-cons no less.

338
00:32:35,318 --> 00:32:37,753
No, but I like it better
than being told it's wrong.

339
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:39,755
I like it better than
being told it's not true.

340
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:42,190
I like it better than
being told what to think.

341
00:32:42,192 --> 00:32:44,292
- It's an identity.
- Protest.

342
00:32:44,294 --> 00:32:46,394
- Same thing.
- Not even close.

343
00:32:46,396 --> 00:32:48,029
You tell me right
here, right now

344
00:32:48,031 --> 00:32:50,132
you 100% don't
believe it's Oh-Mah.

345
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,566
Aha! See that?

346
00:32:52,568 --> 00:32:55,670
I don't believe it's
Oh-Mah. Swear to God!

347
00:32:55,672 --> 00:32:57,139
Sure thing,
Sheriff.

348
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,672
You should go ask
the Whispering Woman.

349
00:32:58,674 --> 00:33:00,074
She might know
what happened.

350
00:33:00,076 --> 00:33:01,575
That's her turf.

351
00:33:01,577 --> 00:33:03,277
With all due
respect, Deputy,

352
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,413
to the ancestors...
fuck that.

353
00:33:05,415 --> 00:33:08,350
You're afraid
of her.

354
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,218
What?

355
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,487
Okay, some.

356
00:33:12,489 --> 00:33:14,055
Is she even
still alive?

357
00:33:14,057 --> 00:33:15,457
She'll always
be alive.

358
00:33:15,459 --> 00:33:17,459
She's not human.

359
00:33:17,461 --> 00:33:20,228
Please tell me you don't
really believe that.

360
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,496
No, not really.

361
00:33:21,498 --> 00:33:23,265
You should go
talk to her.

362
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:25,267
What she knows
will die with her.

363
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:27,501
Listen to her
before it's too late.

364
00:33:27,503 --> 00:33:29,270
Yeah, listening
to answers

365
00:33:29,272 --> 00:33:30,604
you don't
believe in.

366
00:33:30,606 --> 00:33:32,507
At least not in
this day and age.

367
00:33:32,509 --> 00:33:34,109
Probably not.

368
00:33:34,111 --> 00:33:35,643
I really wish I
could believe...

369
00:33:35,645 --> 00:33:37,645
I really do.

370
00:33:37,647 --> 00:33:39,314
Ironic, huh?

371
00:33:39,316 --> 00:33:40,751
I'd say tragic.

372
00:34:03,373 --> 00:34:05,574
You should probably
sit this one out.

373
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:07,077
Ya think?

374
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:24,825
Hey...

375
00:34:24,827 --> 00:34:27,496
whoa ho ho ho!

376
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:30,398
Hey, hey, where's
the funky bunch, man?

377
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,501
The funky...

378
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:37,204
Well, well, well. If
it ain't the convict!

379
00:34:37,206 --> 00:34:40,842
Oh, I apologize...
ex-convict.

380
00:34:40,844 --> 00:34:42,878
Look, guys, there was
an accident on the road.

381
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,713
Does anybody
have a cell phone?

382
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:48,316
Cell phone?
Cell phone?

383
00:34:48,318 --> 00:34:51,820
Think I-think
I lost mine.

384
00:34:51,822 --> 00:34:54,923
Well, sorry
about that.

385
00:34:54,925 --> 00:34:57,191
I mean, hell, it ain't
like we get a lot of

386
00:34:57,193 --> 00:34:59,494
service out in these
parts. I mean, really,

387
00:34:59,496 --> 00:35:01,862
what's a moose gonna
do with a cell phone?

388
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:05,700
Moose... moose
with a cell phone...

389
00:35:05,702 --> 00:35:07,702
Guys, we're just
trying to get back.

390
00:35:07,704 --> 00:35:09,570
It's not so much
the technology,

391
00:35:09,572 --> 00:35:11,238
it's the hoof!

392
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,208
Can't reach those
little buttons.

393
00:35:14,644 --> 00:35:16,244
So, on the
cell phone...

394
00:35:16,246 --> 00:35:18,445
do you have
one or not?

395
00:35:18,447 --> 00:35:20,347
Maybe you could
just point us

396
00:35:20,349 --> 00:35:23,284
in the general
direction of the road.

397
00:35:23,286 --> 00:35:26,323
Road... road?

398
00:35:34,965 --> 00:35:36,831
That way.

399
00:35:39,802 --> 00:35:43,438
Say... I'm curious.

400
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,340
What happened
to that, uh,

401
00:35:45,342 --> 00:35:47,242
pretty little thing
you were with?

402
00:35:47,244 --> 00:35:48,409
Oh, yeah.

403
00:35:48,411 --> 00:35:49,443
My wife?

404
00:35:49,445 --> 00:35:50,778
Ooh.

405
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,914
"My wife?"

406
00:35:52,916 --> 00:35:55,516
She's around.

407
00:35:55,518 --> 00:35:57,554
Around where?

408
00:36:00,523 --> 00:36:02,356
She's around.

409
00:36:02,358 --> 00:36:03,724
Probably shopping.

410
00:36:03,726 --> 00:36:05,526
With the mooses.

411
00:36:07,297 --> 00:36:08,796
For a cell phone!

412
00:36:10,467 --> 00:36:11,733
How about
a radio?

413
00:36:11,735 --> 00:36:13,001
Mm, radio?

414
00:36:13,003 --> 00:36:14,568
Got a radio?

415
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:15,836
Radio?

416
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:18,974
Oh, hey, know
what? I got one.

417
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:21,275
Perfect.

418
00:36:21,277 --> 00:36:22,776
But it don't work.

419
00:36:22,778 --> 00:36:23,912
Aww.

420
00:36:23,914 --> 00:36:26,414
Nope. Damn thing
crapped out on us.

421
00:36:26,416 --> 00:36:28,782
Cheap gook
piece of shit.

422
00:36:28,784 --> 00:36:30,684
Do you mind if I
take a look at it?

423
00:36:30,686 --> 00:36:33,521
You want to
look at my radio?

424
00:36:33,523 --> 00:36:35,657
What, you don't think
I can understand

425
00:36:35,659 --> 00:36:38,260
a basic electronical
device, convict?

426
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:39,728
Is that what
you're saying to me?

427
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:42,264
And you're gonna
help me with that?

428
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:44,432
- Lefty?
- Yeah.

429
00:36:44,434 --> 00:36:45,833
What's that
word say?

430
00:36:45,835 --> 00:36:47,501
It's, uh... "on".

431
00:36:47,503 --> 00:36:50,838
On! Jumping Jesus
on a gump stump!

432
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,574
That's the problem.

433
00:36:53,943 --> 00:36:55,909
Hell, it is a damn
good thing that this

434
00:36:55,911 --> 00:36:57,845
ex-convict wandered
through here with his

435
00:36:57,847 --> 00:37:00,048
taxpayer prison
education and all.

436
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:02,516
City folk...
damn smart.

437
00:37:02,518 --> 00:37:04,853
Yeah, I just figured
out my toaster last week.

438
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:06,720
It makes toast!

439
00:37:06,722 --> 00:37:08,759
Can I use the
radio or not?

440
00:37:11,327 --> 00:37:13,028
I don't think so.

441
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,561
Look, I don't know
where all this

442
00:37:14,563 --> 00:37:15,896
hostility's
coming from,

443
00:37:15,898 --> 00:37:17,632
but we're just
trying to get back.

444
00:37:17,634 --> 00:37:18,999
'cause, hell,
I don't know...

445
00:37:19,001 --> 00:37:21,001
having an ex-convict
in our midst...

446
00:37:21,003 --> 00:37:23,003
I mean, it's nothing
personal, son,

447
00:37:23,005 --> 00:37:25,039
but importing
convicted criminals

448
00:37:25,041 --> 00:37:27,008
into our own backyard...
is that cool, guys?

449
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:28,342
Nah.

450
00:37:28,344 --> 00:37:29,376
No.

451
00:37:29,378 --> 00:37:30,644
Nope.

452
00:37:30,646 --> 00:37:31,845
I paid my debt.

453
00:37:36,753 --> 00:37:39,887
Hot damn. That's
good to know.

454
00:37:39,889 --> 00:37:42,393
Seriously, I'm
done kidding around.

455
00:37:54,838 --> 00:37:58,340
Come on, Max.

456
00:37:58,342 --> 00:37:59,773
Ah, hell, kid...

457
00:37:59,775 --> 00:38:02,610
ha ha! we're just
kidding around!

458
00:38:02,612 --> 00:38:03,912
We're having
some fun!

459
00:38:05,715 --> 00:38:06,847
Just kidding.

460
00:38:06,849 --> 00:38:09,717
We got a CB in
the truck. Right?

461
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:10,686
Yup.

462
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:13,121
We can get you there
in, what, about an hour?

463
00:38:13,123 --> 00:38:14,054
Yeah.

464
00:38:14,056 --> 00:38:15,356
Maybe four.

465
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:17,394
We can get him
there in about an hour.

466
00:38:35,644 --> 00:38:37,445
You know, I'm
still curious...

467
00:38:37,447 --> 00:38:38,912
What happened to
that pretty little

468
00:38:38,914 --> 00:38:40,581
wife of
yours anyway?

469
00:38:40,583 --> 00:38:41,950
I told you,
she's around.

470
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:43,584
Whoa! Whoa!

471
00:38:43,586 --> 00:38:45,686
Oh!

472
00:38:45,688 --> 00:38:48,021
Survey says
thank you, Jesus!

473
00:38:48,023 --> 00:38:50,791
Speak of
the devil.

474
00:38:50,793 --> 00:38:53,461
We had the
accident.

475
00:38:53,463 --> 00:38:54,963
Is that what you
kids are calling it

476
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:56,498
these days?

477
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,666
Ah, hell, I got a boner
a cat couldn't scratch!

478
00:38:59,668 --> 00:39:02,871
Hey! Keep that
shit in your pants.

479
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:04,671
Alright, listen up.

480
00:39:04,673 --> 00:39:06,708
These two
fine citizens,

481
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:08,842
well, they, uh...
they need our help.

482
00:39:08,844 --> 00:39:10,811
And us being...
you know,

483
00:39:10,813 --> 00:39:13,680
good samaritans and
all... we're obliged to

484
00:39:13,682 --> 00:39:15,883
help 'em any
way we can.

485
00:39:15,885 --> 00:39:19,586
So with that being said,
I want you all to treat

486
00:39:19,588 --> 00:39:23,425
our new guests here
with the utmost respect.

487
00:39:25,728 --> 00:39:26,728
Shut up.

488
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:27,996
Sorry.

489
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:30,798
Hey! That means keep
that shit in your pants!

490
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,635
All of ya's...
you hear?

491
00:39:34,637 --> 00:39:35,603
Yes, sir.

492
00:39:35,605 --> 00:39:37,104
Yeah.

493
00:39:37,106 --> 00:39:38,639
Okay.

494
00:39:38,641 --> 00:39:39,974
Yes.

495
00:39:39,976 --> 00:39:45,079
Alright... let's
pack it up.

496
00:39:45,081 --> 00:39:50,121
We're moving
out. Let's go!

497
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:58,693
There's something
in these woods.

498
00:39:58,695 --> 00:40:00,894
We gotta go.

499
00:40:00,896 --> 00:40:02,400
Come on.

500
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,999
Here you go,
sweetheart.

501
00:40:06,001 --> 00:40:07,637
Get going.

502
00:40:14,177 --> 00:40:18,079
Hey...
there you go.

503
00:40:18,081 --> 00:40:20,718
Thank you.

504
00:40:30,927 --> 00:40:33,827
Yeah, alignment's off,
the gears are stripped.

505
00:40:33,829 --> 00:40:36,530
Car was put in park,
moved sideways,

506
00:40:36,532 --> 00:40:38,666
then forward
off the road.

507
00:40:38,668 --> 00:40:40,834
It was pushed?

508
00:40:40,836 --> 00:40:42,836
I don't know
about pushed.

509
00:40:42,838 --> 00:40:46,273
Are you
sure, Nelson?

510
00:40:46,275 --> 00:40:47,941
Well, maybe the
transmission got

511
00:40:47,943 --> 00:40:50,581
knocked there
during the accident.

512
00:40:59,088 --> 00:41:00,590
Yeah, maybe.

513
00:41:16,873 --> 00:41:18,273
Bigfoot got 'em.

514
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:20,008
Big goddamn
footy-mother,

515
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:24,177
bushy, effin'
tall-ass hairy bastard.

516
00:41:24,179 --> 00:41:25,682
You know it!

517
00:41:31,887 --> 00:41:34,190
Sure as eggs is
eggs, Cochise.

518
00:42:45,929 --> 00:42:47,327
Now that we got
you here, uh...

519
00:42:47,329 --> 00:42:49,229
we're not so
bad, are we?

520
00:42:49,231 --> 00:42:51,298
Hell, you could
be in the South...

521
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,200
Hey, Lefty. Are
we in the South?

522
00:42:53,202 --> 00:42:54,802
No, no, we're
not in the South.

523
00:42:54,804 --> 00:42:56,838
Do you even know
where the South is?

524
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,373
Yeah, it's
in the South.

525
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:01,075
I mean, hell, you know,
we as a community...

526
00:43:01,077 --> 00:43:04,679
we really don't mind
you convicts just

527
00:43:04,681 --> 00:43:06,780
waltzing through
our homes, right?

528
00:43:06,782 --> 00:43:07,949
Yeah.

529
00:43:07,951 --> 00:43:10,217
I'm sorry...
ex-convicts.

530
00:43:12,054 --> 00:43:13,755
So you want to
revisit this again?

531
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,289
Just hear me
out, alright?

532
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:18,025
I mean, hell, our
wives and our schools,

533
00:43:18,027 --> 00:43:20,961
they actually find it
enriching, you know,

534
00:43:20,963 --> 00:43:24,365
this close proximity
to such a wealth of...

535
00:43:24,367 --> 00:43:27,001
hell, what's the
word I'm looking for?

536
00:43:27,003 --> 00:43:29,336
How about
"rehabilitation"?

537
00:43:29,338 --> 00:43:32,840
Man, that's
a word and a half.

538
00:43:32,842 --> 00:43:34,041
Sure is.

539
00:43:34,043 --> 00:43:36,177
Looks like
our ex-convict's

540
00:43:36,179 --> 00:43:38,713
got himself
a vocabulary.

541
00:43:38,715 --> 00:43:41,115
Yeah, but that's
not the word

542
00:43:41,117 --> 00:43:42,883
I was
thinking about.

543
00:43:42,885 --> 00:43:45,385
Then what is the word
you were looking for?

544
00:43:45,387 --> 00:43:50,992
Uh... I don't know.
Something, uh...

545
00:43:50,994 --> 00:43:53,961
less fitting for
mixed company, I guess.

546
00:43:55,864 --> 00:43:57,999
You know we're
going the wrong way?

547
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:03,271
The sun rises
in the East.

548
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:06,407
So that's East.
We're going West.

549
00:44:06,409 --> 00:44:08,742
We're going to our
trucks, young lady...

550
00:44:08,744 --> 00:44:11,445
and our trucks
are this way.

551
00:44:11,447 --> 00:44:13,817
It's where the
CB is, darlin'.

552
00:44:44,179 --> 00:44:46,246
Body and spirit look
like they're going

553
00:44:46,248 --> 00:44:48,516
north and south.

554
00:44:48,518 --> 00:44:50,784
I'm joking.

555
00:44:50,786 --> 00:44:52,753
You look
like shit.

556
00:44:52,755 --> 00:44:55,923
Well, thank
you very much.

557
00:44:55,925 --> 00:44:58,191
Go see the
Whispering Woman?

558
00:44:58,193 --> 00:44:59,226
Hell, no.

559
00:44:59,228 --> 00:45:00,528
Scares you,
doesn't she?

560
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:02,195
No!

561
00:45:02,197 --> 00:45:03,798
Okay, yeah.

562
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,199
Yeah, me too.

563
00:45:05,201 --> 00:45:07,934
Verna Six
Trees has cancer.

564
00:45:07,936 --> 00:45:10,338
They're having a peyote
ceremony for her,

565
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:12,139
you should come.

566
00:45:12,141 --> 00:45:14,976
Verna Six Trees...

567
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:18,880
well, I really
hate those things.

568
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:21,883
They go on forever,
smoke burns my eyes,

569
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:23,550
I get piles.

570
00:45:23,552 --> 00:45:26,253
Take the medicine.
Have a vision.

571
00:45:26,255 --> 00:45:28,356
Offset all this white
man law and order,

572
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:30,258
you need to be
reminded that you're

573
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,059
a part of
Mother Earth.

574
00:45:32,061 --> 00:45:33,994
Teach you to be
nurturing, loving,

575
00:45:33,996 --> 00:45:36,063
forgiving,
self-healing.

576
00:45:37,867 --> 00:45:40,066
Go ahead,
make fun of me.

577
00:45:40,068 --> 00:45:44,938
Timing's perfect.
Must mean something.

578
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:47,374
Like a scheduled
airplane out of the blue.

579
00:45:47,376 --> 00:45:49,976
Where are they
holding the ceremony?

580
00:45:49,978 --> 00:45:51,479
At Mama
Day's farm.

581
00:45:51,481 --> 00:45:53,046
Not the
reservation?

582
00:45:53,048 --> 00:45:54,014
Not the Res.

583
00:45:54,016 --> 00:45:57,217
Reservation depresses
the shit out of me.

584
00:45:57,219 --> 00:45:59,122
You drive.

585
00:46:12,235 --> 00:46:15,271
Hey, ex-convict.
Come here.

586
00:46:19,342 --> 00:46:21,275
I have a name.

587
00:46:21,277 --> 00:46:23,313
Well, hell, I
don't know it.

588
00:46:30,519 --> 00:46:32,019
It's Max.

589
00:46:32,021 --> 00:46:33,854
Max, huh?

590
00:46:36,525 --> 00:46:39,327
Everybody...
meet Max.

591
00:46:41,097 --> 00:46:42,262
Hi, Max.

592
00:46:42,264 --> 00:46:43,898
Maxi pad.

593
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:46,099
Hi, Max.

594
00:46:46,101 --> 00:46:51,505
Well, there, Max.
You know how I can tell

595
00:46:51,507 --> 00:46:54,008
that you just
got out, son?

596
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:58,479
Well, you ever seen an
ex-con eat his food?

597
00:46:58,481 --> 00:47:01,315
Yeah, well, they
guard it, you know?

598
00:47:01,317 --> 00:47:05,019
In a situation, or a
scenario, if you will,

599
00:47:05,021 --> 00:47:08,623
when they clearly don't
need to, they wrap it up,

600
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:11,559
hide it... like
someone's gonna come by

601
00:47:11,561 --> 00:47:14,961
and steal it from them
when clearly no one is.

602
00:47:14,963 --> 00:47:17,000
And...?

603
00:47:19,635 --> 00:47:21,401
And...

604
00:47:21,403 --> 00:47:27,173
Well, Max.
That's how you are...

605
00:47:27,175 --> 00:47:30,311
with that pretty
little wife of yours.

606
00:47:30,313 --> 00:47:32,412
She's my wife.

607
00:47:32,414 --> 00:47:34,248
It's still rude.

608
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:36,316
Excuse me for trying
to protect my wife.

609
00:47:36,318 --> 00:47:38,619
Besides, I don't
think she's your type.

610
00:47:38,621 --> 00:47:40,588
That's no excuse
for being rude.

611
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:42,088
Ain't no
social graces.

612
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:46,128
Hicks!
Stand down.

613
00:47:49,565 --> 00:47:52,266
Now look at what
you gone and done.

614
00:47:52,268 --> 00:47:54,501
You upset my
boys here.

615
00:47:54,503 --> 00:47:57,037
I believe this
calls for an, uh...

616
00:47:57,039 --> 00:47:58,305
atonement!

617
00:47:58,307 --> 00:48:00,240
Okay, enough!
We appreciate

618
00:48:00,242 --> 00:48:02,543
the fact that your
radio does not work.

619
00:48:02,545 --> 00:48:07,081
What? No, no. The
radio works. Right?

620
00:48:07,083 --> 00:48:10,050
It, uh... well, it
doesn't transmit.

621
00:48:10,052 --> 00:48:12,320
Sure it does, I was
just using it earlier.

622
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:13,621
I was
talking to...

623
00:48:13,623 --> 00:48:15,289
Okay, the
radio works?!

624
00:48:15,291 --> 00:48:16,958
Yeah!

625
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,726
Uh, no...

626
00:48:18,728 --> 00:48:21,128
I meant, um,
something else.

627
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:22,697
Radio's broken.

628
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:25,398
I gotta pee!

629
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:26,367
Get back here!

630
00:48:26,369 --> 00:48:27,200
I gotta pee!

631
00:48:27,202 --> 00:48:28,369
Get back...

632
00:48:28,371 --> 00:48:30,371
Why you
gotta run?

633
00:48:30,373 --> 00:48:33,541
Eze! Get your
butt over here.

634
00:48:33,543 --> 00:48:35,141
What?

635
00:48:35,143 --> 00:48:36,309
Go get him.

636
00:48:36,311 --> 00:48:37,510
He's peeing.

637
00:48:37,512 --> 00:48:39,546
I don't care! You ain't
holding it for him!

638
00:48:39,548 --> 00:48:41,148
Go get him!

639
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:42,682
So mean.

640
00:48:42,684 --> 00:48:44,418
Don't get
your ass lost!

641
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:45,418
Shut up!

642
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:46,188
Go!

643
00:48:49,659 --> 00:48:51,559
I swear,
that kid...

644
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:54,597
he'd lose his head if
it wasn't attached.

645
00:48:57,099 --> 00:48:58,699
Ah, you're it.

646
00:48:58,701 --> 00:49:00,700
Come on, man.

647
00:49:00,702 --> 00:49:02,702
We don't have
BD on our asses,

648
00:49:02,704 --> 00:49:04,537
we can at least
have a little fun.

649
00:49:04,539 --> 00:49:06,474
I have fun.

650
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:09,043
When's the last time
you really had fun?

651
00:49:09,045 --> 00:49:11,345
I don't know, yesterday
we went fishing...

652
00:49:11,347 --> 00:49:12,713
remember that?

653
00:49:12,715 --> 00:49:14,514
Hold on, I'm gonna
stop for a minute.

654
00:49:14,516 --> 00:49:16,650
I really actually do
have to take a piss.

655
00:49:16,652 --> 00:49:18,184
You do that.

656
00:49:18,186 --> 00:49:20,054
I plan to,
thank you.

657
00:49:20,056 --> 00:49:22,358
'Preciate your
permission to urinate.

658
00:49:29,331 --> 00:49:30,563
Oh, boy...

659
00:49:30,565 --> 00:49:31,731
Ohh...

660
00:49:31,733 --> 00:49:33,666
You in dutch
with BD, Gord.

661
00:49:33,668 --> 00:49:35,068
Yeah, no shit.

662
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:36,403
He gonna
hide you.

663
00:49:36,405 --> 00:49:39,373
Yeah, that's why I'm out
here and not with him.

664
00:49:42,512 --> 00:49:45,079
What was that?

665
00:49:45,081 --> 00:49:48,215
Hey!

666
00:49:48,217 --> 00:49:51,519
Ah, shit! Peed on
my goddamn leg.

667
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:53,753
Hey, Critter,
what's...

668
00:49:53,755 --> 00:50:02,095
Critter? Critter?

669
00:50:02,097 --> 00:50:03,400
Shit!

670
00:50:08,371 --> 00:50:11,407
Critter, Critter...

671
00:50:13,643 --> 00:50:15,842
Critter?

672
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:23,152
What...?

673
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,400
Fuck you, BD.

674
00:51:13,402 --> 00:51:14,802
"Don't get lost"...

675
00:51:14,804 --> 00:51:16,840
fuck you. I do
what I want.

676
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:27,213
Hello?

677
00:51:27,215 --> 00:51:30,217
Critter!

678
00:51:30,219 --> 00:51:31,318
Dammit.

679
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,753
Gordy!

680
00:51:33,755 --> 00:51:34,790
Critter!

681
00:51:46,235 --> 00:51:48,271
No...

682
00:51:52,742 --> 00:51:54,275
Critter!

683
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:55,311
Anybody?

684
00:52:17,666 --> 00:52:18,701
Fuck.

685
00:53:13,289 --> 00:53:14,655
Augh!

686
00:53:14,657 --> 00:53:16,557
Ow!

687
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:18,492
Ugh.

688
00:53:18,494 --> 00:53:22,563
Dammit!

689
00:53:27,503 --> 00:53:30,336
Oh, God!

690
00:54:21,356 --> 00:54:24,724
Shh shh.
You hear that?

691
00:54:24,726 --> 00:54:26,626
Hear what?

692
00:54:26,628 --> 00:54:28,929
Sounds like
them boys is

693
00:54:28,931 --> 00:54:31,498
sodomizing
each other again!

694
00:54:34,036 --> 00:54:35,903
Sorry we're
keeping you.

695
00:54:35,905 --> 00:54:37,403
What?

696
00:54:37,405 --> 00:54:38,771
Well, you sound
like a man of means.

697
00:54:38,773 --> 00:54:40,106
Shut up,
all of you.

698
00:54:40,108 --> 00:54:41,508
I was
just joking.

699
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:42,376
Right.

700
00:54:42,378 --> 00:54:43,510
I said shut it!

701
00:54:43,512 --> 00:54:44,945
What the fuck
is going on?

702
00:54:44,947 --> 00:54:47,780
So the radio works...
great! Good news.

703
00:54:47,782 --> 00:54:50,883
Maybe... maybe
it doesn't.

704
00:54:50,885 --> 00:54:55,054
Hell, you see, this
here hunting expedition...

705
00:54:55,056 --> 00:54:57,624
it's not exactly
on the up and up.

706
00:54:57,626 --> 00:54:58,592
You know?

707
00:54:58,594 --> 00:55:00,894
So you're keeping your
criminal activities

708
00:55:00,896 --> 00:55:02,463
from him?

709
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:04,664
Not so much, it's
just not wanting to

710
00:55:04,666 --> 00:55:06,666
broadcast it all
over the airwaves.

711
00:55:06,668 --> 00:55:09,001
At the gas station
you all were loading up

712
00:55:09,003 --> 00:55:11,104
for a hunting party right
in front of the sheriff.

713
00:55:11,106 --> 00:55:12,805
We hadn't killed
anything yet.

714
00:55:12,807 --> 00:55:14,742
You haven't
killed anything now.

715
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:15,912
Not yet.

716
00:55:18,947 --> 00:55:20,414
Ah, hell,
sweet buns.

717
00:55:20,416 --> 00:55:22,115
What are you so concerned
about anyway, huh?

718
00:55:22,117 --> 00:55:23,684
We've been more
than accommodating,

719
00:55:23,686 --> 00:55:25,084
- am I right?
- Yeah.

720
00:55:25,086 --> 00:55:25,885
That's enough!

721
00:55:25,887 --> 00:55:27,420
Hold on... let
me make the call.

722
00:55:27,422 --> 00:55:28,621
We'll just pretend
you're not here.

723
00:55:28,623 --> 00:55:29,557
How 'bout that?

724
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:32,825
Honeybunch, it just
don't work that way.

725
00:55:32,827 --> 00:55:34,862
Then how
does it work?

726
00:55:34,864 --> 00:55:36,963
Well, you see, it
works like this.

727
00:55:36,965 --> 00:55:40,601
We have guns!
Lots of 'em.

728
00:55:40,603 --> 00:55:43,637
You...

729
00:55:43,639 --> 00:55:45,572
you ain't even
wearing pants!

730
00:55:52,014 --> 00:55:57,117
Jesus, Trout! It
wasn't that funny.

731
00:56:11,867 --> 00:56:13,635
What the fuck
was that?!

732
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:18,704
What the
fuck was that?

733
00:56:18,706 --> 00:56:19,742
Eze!

734
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:26,012
Goddammit, Frank!

735
00:56:33,621 --> 00:56:36,789
Quit shooting,
Frank! Dammit!

736
00:56:38,027 --> 00:56:39,159
Frank!

737
00:56:39,161 --> 00:56:41,528
Frank, what
do you see?

738
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:43,229
Goddammit! Jesus!

739
00:56:44,699 --> 00:56:47,166
Frank! Quit
shooting, goddammit!

740
00:56:47,168 --> 00:56:48,937
Go! Go!

741
00:56:53,175 --> 00:56:55,075
Get the fuck
off me!

742
00:56:55,077 --> 00:56:56,809
What do you
see, Frank?

743
00:56:58,112 --> 00:56:59,479
Frank!

744
00:56:59,481 --> 00:57:00,746
Goddammit, Frank!

745
00:57:00,748 --> 00:57:02,483
What are you
shooting at?!

746
00:57:44,293 --> 00:57:47,693
Max?

747
00:57:47,695 --> 00:57:49,929
It's me. Wake up.

748
00:57:49,931 --> 00:57:51,233
Wake up...

749
01:00:38,701 --> 01:00:40,003
Auugh!

750
01:02:28,577 --> 01:02:30,079
Max...

751
01:02:45,159 --> 01:02:46,461
Ashley...

752
01:02:56,471 --> 01:02:58,240
Oh, Jesus.

753
01:04:01,436 --> 01:04:02,135
Hey.

754
01:04:02,137 --> 01:04:04,336
Hi. Oh, so
good to see you.

755
01:04:04,338 --> 01:04:06,373
Come on in,
see everybody.

756
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:08,974
Hi.

757
01:04:08,976 --> 01:04:11,144
Nice to have
you here.

758
01:04:11,146 --> 01:04:13,479
Please, welcome.

759
01:05:17,112 --> 01:05:19,682
Come on.
We're ready.

760
01:09:14,481 --> 01:09:18,785
Auuugh!

761
01:14:57,324 --> 01:15:02,061
Help! Help!

762
01:16:44,865 --> 01:16:54,005
Ah. Ah... ah.

763
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:48,797
There he is.

764
01:17:50,398 --> 01:17:51,930
How long
was I out?

765
01:17:51,932 --> 01:17:54,032
All night.

766
01:17:54,034 --> 01:17:56,434
Where's Ashley?

767
01:17:56,436 --> 01:17:59,304
Here's the deal.

768
01:17:59,306 --> 01:18:03,442
There's a creature,
lives in these woods,

769
01:18:03,444 --> 01:18:06,778
as ancient as my
tribe remembers.

770
01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:08,781
The legend says that
when our chiefs die

771
01:18:08,783 --> 01:18:11,951
they come back, their
spirits, as the Oh-Mah.

772
01:18:11,953 --> 01:18:13,218
The what?

773
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:16,388
It's where the legend
of Sasquatch comes from.

774
01:18:16,390 --> 01:18:18,456
We're talking
about Bigfoot?

775
01:18:18,458 --> 01:18:24,062
This woman
watches the Oh-Mah.

776
01:18:24,064 --> 01:18:26,499
She said it
stopped at you.

777
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:27,967
It got prideful.

778
01:18:27,969 --> 01:18:30,468
Its pride distracted
it and it got shot.

779
01:18:30,470 --> 01:18:34,173
It's down an arm,
which means no arrows,

780
01:18:34,175 --> 01:18:36,474
which means it's
out of balance.

781
01:18:36,476 --> 01:18:40,178
Since it's hurt, we stand
a chance to take it down.

782
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:44,383
She said the Oh-Mah
took your wife, Ashley.

783
01:18:44,385 --> 01:18:49,120
She has a chance
if we fight it.

784
01:18:49,122 --> 01:18:52,391
This Oh-Mah, it's
a sentry, sort of,

785
01:18:52,393 --> 01:18:54,360
watching over the
periphery of the forest

786
01:18:54,362 --> 01:18:57,028
where it lives and it
has seen the workings

787
01:18:57,030 --> 01:18:59,964
of man's chaos and
evil for too long.

788
01:18:59,966 --> 01:19:02,500
It put it out
of balance.

789
01:19:02,502 --> 01:19:04,536
So we're talking
about a Bigfoot

790
01:19:04,538 --> 01:19:06,972
that's... what...
crazy?

791
01:19:06,974 --> 01:19:07,973
No.

792
01:19:07,975 --> 01:19:12,111
Well... kinda.
Sort of.

793
01:19:12,113 --> 01:19:13,512
A lot,
actually.

794
01:19:13,514 --> 01:19:14,479
Awesome.

795
01:19:14,481 --> 01:19:17,016
I guess that's just
bad luck for us, huh?

796
01:19:17,018 --> 01:19:17,983
Not really.

797
01:19:17,985 --> 01:19:21,085
A man out of balance is
easier to knock over.

798
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:23,188
Is that Native
American wisdom?

799
01:19:23,190 --> 01:19:25,089
Hell, I just
made it up.

800
01:19:25,091 --> 01:19:27,092
So, yeah.

801
01:19:27,094 --> 01:19:30,361
It's time
to go, Max.

802
01:19:30,363 --> 01:19:31,866
Now.

803
01:19:32,533 --> 01:19:35,099
These are
Oh-Mah's weapons.

804
01:19:35,101 --> 01:19:36,268
We need 'em.

805
01:19:36,270 --> 01:19:37,570
Don't we
have guns?

806
01:19:37,572 --> 01:19:40,004
Its primary sense is
its sense of smell.

807
01:19:40,006 --> 01:19:42,141
It can smell
gunpowder a mile away.

808
01:19:42,143 --> 01:19:47,012
It will stalk you and gut
you before you can say

809
01:20:29,457 --> 01:20:31,490
This will
hide your smell.

810
01:20:31,492 --> 01:20:33,829
Get plenty
of it on you.

811
01:20:36,264 --> 01:20:37,833
Oh, God.

812
01:22:10,323 --> 01:22:11,690
We good?

813
01:22:11,692 --> 01:22:13,929
We bad.

814
01:23:39,646 --> 01:23:43,848
Get off!
Get off me!

815
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:45,753
Get off!!!

816
01:24:00,301 --> 01:24:03,367
Whoever it is, they're
coming for you, asshole!

817
01:24:03,369 --> 01:24:05,571
They're coming
for you!

818
01:26:20,774 --> 01:26:23,811
So, uh... what
is the plan?

819
01:26:28,314 --> 01:26:31,817
You find
your wife.

820
01:26:31,819 --> 01:26:36,591
You find your wife,
you go back to your boy.

821
