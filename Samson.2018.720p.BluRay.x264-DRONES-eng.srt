1
00:00:47,771 --> 00:00:50,081
<i>400 years ago,</i>

2
00:00:50,211 --> 00:00:52,851
<i>God delivered us
to this Promised Land.</i>

3
00:00:52,971 --> 00:00:56,169
<i>But as the years passed,</i>

4
00:00:56,291 --> 00:01:00,763
<i>many of our tribes forgot
and turned their backs to God.</i>

5
00:01:00,891 --> 00:01:05,249
<i>When the Philistines came,
they found us weak, divided,</i>

6
00:01:05,371 --> 00:01:08,409
<i>and they enslaved our people.</i>

7
00:01:08,531 --> 00:01:10,762
<i>Our only hope was a prophecy</i>

8
00:01:10,931 --> 00:01:15,369
<i>that a man would be born,
one who would rise up</i>

9
00:01:15,491 --> 00:01:17,801
<i>and set our people free.</i>

10
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:32,570
<i>Oh, great Dagon, lord of battles,</i>

11
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:36,207
bestower of wealth
and bountiful harvests.

12
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:40,450
Look upon your people,
the Philistines of Gaza.

13
00:01:41,891 --> 00:01:43,962
We are gathered here
at your feet

14
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:46,123
to bring you gifts

15
00:01:46,251 --> 00:01:48,720
gathered by the hands
of the Hebrews.

16
00:01:48,851 --> 00:01:51,650
Move. Move.
Who gave unto us

17
00:01:51,771 --> 00:01:53,842
to conquer and command!

18
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:58,841
Look how easily the Hebrews
forsake their God

19
00:01:58,971 --> 00:02:00,564
and serve Dagon.

20
00:02:00,731 --> 00:02:03,610
They grew this food...

21
00:02:41,331 --> 00:02:43,084
Throw away the outside.

22
00:02:43,211 --> 00:02:46,841
Cook the inside,
then eat the outside.

23
00:02:46,971 --> 00:02:48,803
What is it?

24
00:02:48,931 --> 00:02:50,331
What approaches with a stalk

25
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:52,403
but has ears that cannot hear?

26
00:02:52,531 --> 00:02:55,842
That riddle's almost as bad
as this plan, brother.

27
00:02:57,171 --> 00:02:58,241
Move along.

28
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:18,211
What has flesh but no blood,

29
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,084
and a heart made of stone?

30
00:03:20,211 --> 00:03:22,885
Are you talking about
the olives or Father?

31
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,010
Hey. Hebrew.

32
00:03:26,131 --> 00:03:27,565
What are you doing back there?

33
00:03:27,691 --> 00:03:29,603
I'm, uh...

34
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:30,960
I'm waiting for my master.

35
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:32,764
He prays in the temple.
Samson.

36
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:34,007
What's happening?

37
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,930
Then why do you hide your face?

38
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:39,486
Remove your hood.
Hey, brother.

39
00:03:39,611 --> 00:03:42,001
Hebrew, show yourself.

40
00:03:42,131 --> 00:03:44,646
Samson, what's happening there?

41
00:03:44,771 --> 00:03:46,763
Brother?

42
00:03:49,331 --> 00:03:51,004
I know him.

43
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:53,805
That's Samson, the Hebrew
strongman from the pits.

44
00:03:53,971 --> 00:03:56,361
Be very careful.
You're coming with us.

45
00:03:56,491 --> 00:03:59,006
We'll find your master, see
if you're telling the truth.

46
00:03:59,131 --> 00:04:00,565
Of course.

47
00:04:00,691 --> 00:04:02,967
Why would I resist?

48
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,607
Samson!

49
00:04:13,731 --> 00:04:15,962
Samson!

50
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:21,202
Thieves! Thieves in the temple!

51
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:23,522
Harder to catch, the faster I run.
Get them!

52
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:25,722
What am I?
Too easy.

53
00:04:25,851 --> 00:04:27,046
Your breath.

54
00:04:32,131 --> 00:04:34,009
Get those thieves!
The eyes of Dagon

55
00:04:34,131 --> 00:04:36,965
see you for what you are.

56
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:40,243
You shall not escape his wrath.

57
00:04:40,371 --> 00:04:43,603
He will crush you
and all who defy him.

58
00:04:43,771 --> 00:04:45,046
Get them!

59
00:04:45,171 --> 00:04:46,571
This way!

60
00:04:46,731 --> 00:04:47,721
Don't let them escape!

61
00:04:50,051 --> 00:04:51,565
Stop him, you fool!

62
00:05:05,331 --> 00:05:07,891
No!

63
00:05:09,331 --> 00:05:10,321
No!

64
00:05:11,491 --> 00:05:12,845
No!

65
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:19,164
Brother, this way.

66
00:05:26,251 --> 00:05:28,482
Come back here!
Thank you.

67
00:05:32,931 --> 00:05:34,650
This way to the gate.

68
00:05:36,451 --> 00:05:38,602
Where you going? It's this way.

69
00:05:39,931 --> 00:05:41,445
Split up!

70
00:05:41,571 --> 00:05:43,767
There they go!
They went into the alley! The alley!

71
00:05:43,891 --> 00:05:46,247
There's nowhere to run, Hebrew!

72
00:05:47,451 --> 00:05:49,204
Get him, get him! Quick!

73
00:06:04,011 --> 00:06:05,491
Morning, ladies.

74
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:08,051
What do we have here?

75
00:06:08,171 --> 00:06:09,730
There he is!

76
00:06:09,851 --> 00:06:11,001
Thief!

77
00:06:11,131 --> 00:06:12,360
Uh... I'll be right back.

78
00:06:12,491 --> 00:06:14,403
This should only take a moment.
Come on!

79
00:06:14,571 --> 00:06:16,210
Come back here!

80
00:06:16,331 --> 00:06:17,731
Come back here, thief!

81
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:21,083
Whoa! Oh.

82
00:06:21,211 --> 00:06:22,611
What happened to you?

83
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:24,768
Let's never speak of this.
There!

84
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:25,927
There he is!
Go!

85
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:27,167
Get back here, thieves!

86
00:06:27,331 --> 00:06:28,447
This way, brother!

87
00:07:00,051 --> 00:07:01,565
Hebrews!

88
00:07:01,691 --> 00:07:03,728
If this month's tribute
falls short,

89
00:07:03,851 --> 00:07:06,082
next month will be double!

90
00:07:11,851 --> 00:07:13,410
Get out!

91
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:17,211
I know you have more!
Where is it?!

92
00:07:17,331 --> 00:07:18,321
No. Stop.

93
00:07:25,891 --> 00:07:28,963
Where is Samson?
He will be here.

94
00:07:39,771 --> 00:07:41,683
Please.

95
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:43,928
Show mercy, my lord.

96
00:07:49,211 --> 00:07:52,488
And what form
should my mercy take?

97
00:07:52,611 --> 00:07:57,208
The tribute,
it is too much, my lord.

98
00:07:57,331 --> 00:08:01,803
We starve while our wheat
grows mold in your barns.

99
00:08:01,971 --> 00:08:06,409
Can you not spare us
a little more, my lord?

100
00:08:14,971 --> 00:08:17,361
What is your name, Hebrew?

101
00:08:17,491 --> 00:08:20,689
My name is Tobias, my lord.

102
00:08:20,811 --> 00:08:22,643
Tobias.

103
00:08:25,011 --> 00:08:27,731
I, Prince Rallah,

104
00:08:27,851 --> 00:08:30,491
have heard this man's cry.

105
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:35,242
And as commander
of the Philistine army,

106
00:08:35,371 --> 00:08:38,887
I declare henceforth this man

107
00:08:39,011 --> 00:08:41,207
shall never hunger again.

108
00:08:55,531 --> 00:08:58,763
Does anyone else desire mercy?

109
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:17,328
Back to work.
Back to work!

110
00:09:26,731 --> 00:09:28,165
<i>Made you wish, little brother.</i>

111
00:09:33,171 --> 00:09:36,721
Another man died today.

112
00:09:36,851 --> 00:09:41,209
Tobias was killed
by the Philistine commander.

113
00:09:48,251 --> 00:09:51,688
You were called by God,

114
00:09:51,811 --> 00:09:55,600
gifted with His power
to deliver His people.

115
00:09:55,731 --> 00:09:59,407
The council think it's his time
for a judge to be anointed.

116
00:09:59,531 --> 00:10:02,842
We do not need a judge.
We need peace.

117
00:10:02,971 --> 00:10:05,008
Remember the prophecy?

118
00:10:05,131 --> 00:10:07,407
"Samson of the tribe of Dan,

119
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:12,606
chosen by the Living God
to be His hand of vengeance."

120
00:10:12,731 --> 00:10:14,404
It's His will.

121
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,329
But it is not mine.

122
00:10:16,451 --> 00:10:18,807
Son, you are
not like other Hebrews.

123
00:10:18,931 --> 00:10:21,366
You're meant for so much more.
You were...

124
00:10:21,491 --> 00:10:24,370
You never fail
to remind me of this.

125
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:27,723
Everything God has required
of me, I have done.

126
00:10:27,851 --> 00:10:29,444
I kept every vow.

127
00:10:29,571 --> 00:10:32,370
No wine, no touching the dead,
no cutting of my hair.

128
00:10:32,491 --> 00:10:33,845
And where has it gotten me?

129
00:10:33,971 --> 00:10:36,645
Where has it gotten us?

130
00:10:36,771 --> 00:10:39,002
Are we free from rule?
Do we have peace?

131
00:10:39,131 --> 00:10:41,600
Why does God withhold
what we desire?

132
00:10:41,731 --> 00:10:45,566
Samson, you must not forget
who you are.

133
00:10:47,531 --> 00:10:50,569
<i>The silos are half
full after the tribute today.</i>

134
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,648
<i>Tomorrow, we will fill
the remainder from Accra.</i>

135
00:10:57,131 --> 00:10:58,929
Is that all?

136
00:10:59,051 --> 00:11:01,327
There are whispers

137
00:11:01,451 --> 00:11:03,807
of a Hebrew with great strength.

138
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:06,765
His people believe him
to be a savior,

139
00:11:06,891 --> 00:11:09,326
but it is a story
for slaves, nothing more.

140
00:11:10,691 --> 00:11:12,648
Stories.

141
00:11:12,771 --> 00:11:15,240
Stories are possibilities.

142
00:11:15,411 --> 00:11:17,289
And possibilities are hope.

143
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:20,370
And hope...
hope is rebellion.

144
00:11:22,171 --> 00:11:23,730
I want you to investigate this.

145
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:25,683
Should I not be doing
something more

146
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:27,040
than keeping watch over slaves?

147
00:11:27,171 --> 00:11:28,890
You think this is beneath you?

148
00:11:29,051 --> 00:11:30,690
But, Father...

149
00:11:30,811 --> 00:11:34,282
In matters of the crown,
do not call me "Father."

150
00:11:34,411 --> 00:11:36,209
I'm your king.

151
00:11:36,331 --> 00:11:39,051
Do as I say.

152
00:11:39,171 --> 00:11:41,288
Yes, my king.

153
00:11:43,251 --> 00:11:44,651
Now.

154
00:11:54,731 --> 00:11:56,882
Don't even think about it.

155
00:12:07,211 --> 00:12:08,804
What's happening?

156
00:12:09,891 --> 00:12:11,484
Samson.

157
00:12:11,611 --> 00:12:13,728
The Philistines
have a new fighter.

158
00:12:13,851 --> 00:12:15,285
Bolcom from Egypt.

159
00:12:15,411 --> 00:12:17,289
He can't be beaten.

160
00:12:17,411 --> 00:12:20,290
He mocks our people,
and he mocks our God.

161
00:12:20,411 --> 00:12:22,050
But you can show him.

162
00:12:22,171 --> 00:12:24,049
Samson's not interested.

163
00:12:24,171 --> 00:12:26,322
Our father's given us...

164
00:12:27,651 --> 00:12:29,290
Pathetic!

165
00:12:29,411 --> 00:12:32,324
I have fought men
from every land.

166
00:12:32,491 --> 00:12:35,643
These Hebrews and their puny God

167
00:12:35,771 --> 00:12:37,569
are like fighting children!

168
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:39,842
Send two against me!

169
00:12:39,971 --> 00:12:42,486
God Dagon guarantees

170
00:12:42,611 --> 00:12:44,011
many returns.

171
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:46,646
Support your Hebrew fighters.

172
00:12:46,771 --> 00:12:48,524
Fight well, gentlemen.

173
00:12:48,651 --> 00:12:50,722
A hundred manehs.

174
00:12:50,851 --> 00:12:52,888
Let the fighting begin.

175
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,807
Brother, think.

176
00:13:04,931 --> 00:13:07,924
Why would they bring this
monster if not to draw you out?

177
00:13:08,051 --> 00:13:09,770
Something's not right here.

178
00:13:11,451 --> 00:13:13,204
I'm just gonna take a look.

179
00:13:13,331 --> 00:13:15,323
What's the harm in that?

180
00:13:17,091 --> 00:13:18,923
The last time you said that,
I cracked two of my...

181
00:13:20,211 --> 00:13:21,406
Yeah!

182
00:13:25,891 --> 00:13:26,881
Father.

183
00:13:27,011 --> 00:13:28,570
The fights turn my stomach.

184
00:13:28,691 --> 00:13:30,205
Can I please be excused?

185
00:13:30,331 --> 00:13:34,245
There are many fine nobles here
with deep pockets.

186
00:13:34,371 --> 00:13:36,249
Mingle with them, hmm?

187
00:13:36,371 --> 00:13:38,488
Uh, and try to smile.

188
00:13:44,251 --> 00:13:47,244
You people are weak!

189
00:13:47,371 --> 00:13:51,331
And deserve an even weaker God.

190
00:13:51,451 --> 00:13:54,046
Our God is not weak.

191
00:13:54,171 --> 00:13:55,685
And neither are His people.

192
00:13:55,811 --> 00:13:57,803
Look, it's Samson.
Samson.

193
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:03,125
Ooh... the Hebrew champion.

194
00:14:04,451 --> 00:14:07,330
A bag of silver for the victor.

195
00:14:07,451 --> 00:14:09,329
Only one?

196
00:14:09,451 --> 00:14:12,728
Do you have such little faith
in your god?

197
00:14:13,851 --> 00:14:15,126
All right.

198
00:14:15,251 --> 00:14:18,050
Two bags of silver, then.

199
00:14:19,411 --> 00:14:21,084
Samson, Father will be furious.

200
00:14:21,211 --> 00:14:23,282
Brother, are you listening?

201
00:14:23,411 --> 00:14:26,051
Ten to one!

202
00:14:30,331 --> 00:14:32,527
Bolcom! Bolcom! Bolcom!

203
00:14:32,691 --> 00:14:36,287
Bolcom! Bolcom!
Bolcom! Bolcom!

204
00:14:49,211 --> 00:14:51,248
Bets are closed.

205
00:14:51,371 --> 00:14:52,771
Let the fighting begin.

206
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:58,767
Brother.

207
00:14:58,891 --> 00:15:00,644
Are you all right?

208
00:15:00,771 --> 00:15:03,525
Find out who she is,
and I will be.

209
00:15:03,651 --> 00:15:06,291
Bolcom! Bolcom! Bolcom!

210
00:15:06,411 --> 00:15:07,481
Bolcom! Bolcom!

211
00:15:13,531 --> 00:15:17,411
Bolcom! Bolcom! Bolcom!

212
00:15:17,571 --> 00:15:20,882
Where is your
Hebrew champion now, huh?

213
00:15:21,011 --> 00:15:24,766
Dagon has proven his power.

214
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:26,610
And I have proven mine.

215
00:15:36,371 --> 00:15:38,602
God...

216
00:15:38,731 --> 00:15:40,882
give me Your strength.

217
00:15:42,971 --> 00:15:45,281
My name is Samson.

218
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,528
My name is Samson,

219
00:15:48,651 --> 00:15:51,041
and I serve the Living God.

220
00:15:54,771 --> 00:15:57,366
And you have proven nothing.

221
00:16:06,651 --> 00:16:08,165
Yield! The silver is yours.

222
00:16:08,331 --> 00:16:10,766
Just... just put the rock down.

223
00:16:10,891 --> 00:16:13,360
Samson! Samson! Samson!

224
00:16:21,331 --> 00:16:22,890
Yeah!

225
00:16:23,051 --> 00:16:25,407
Samson! Samson! Samson!

226
00:16:25,531 --> 00:16:26,806
Brother!

227
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,368
<i>Father.</i>

228
00:16:44,531 --> 00:16:46,045
Look what Samson did.

229
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,009
I heard.

230
00:16:49,131 --> 00:16:51,282
You can take it to the council.

231
00:16:52,891 --> 00:16:55,326
But he won these for us.

232
00:16:55,451 --> 00:16:58,603
Would you feast if the rest
of us were starving?

233
00:16:58,731 --> 00:17:01,166
Your brother's
becoming arrogant.

234
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:04,329
He is doing
what he sees as right.

235
00:17:04,451 --> 00:17:07,728
He only sees what's right
in front of him.

236
00:17:07,891 --> 00:17:09,371
That's all.

237
00:17:13,771 --> 00:17:15,251
Halt!

238
00:17:15,371 --> 00:17:17,249
Halt for the prince.

239
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:23,211
Well, if it is not

240
00:17:23,331 --> 00:17:25,288
the greatest fighter
riches can buy.

241
00:17:25,451 --> 00:17:27,522
Shh.

242
00:17:27,651 --> 00:17:29,768
Lord, you hired us to draw him out.

243
00:17:29,891 --> 00:17:31,962
We never promised victory.

244
00:17:32,091 --> 00:17:34,322
Right.

245
00:17:34,451 --> 00:17:36,090
Right you are.

246
00:17:39,931 --> 00:17:41,809
You there.

247
00:17:41,931 --> 00:17:44,651
Your master has cost me
quite a lot today.

248
00:17:44,771 --> 00:17:46,330
My lord...
Hold your tongue,

249
00:17:46,451 --> 00:17:48,647
or I shall have it cut
from your mouth.

250
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:52,884
Does this bother you?

251
00:17:53,011 --> 00:17:55,810
The riches your master
has cost me?

252
00:17:57,771 --> 00:17:59,251
I guess not.

253
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:00,805
Very well.

254
00:18:00,931 --> 00:18:04,129
You will enter my service
until your debt is paid.

255
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:06,846
Well...
not all of you.

256
00:18:18,011 --> 00:18:19,286
<i>The rumor is true.</i>

257
00:18:19,411 --> 00:18:22,529
I saw him lift a boulder
the size of an ox

258
00:18:22,651 --> 00:18:23,971
without strain.

259
00:18:24,131 --> 00:18:25,850
The Hebrew God is in him.

260
00:18:26,931 --> 00:18:28,331
Within him?

261
00:18:28,451 --> 00:18:29,851
Yes.

262
00:18:30,011 --> 00:18:31,923
What is he, then?
Is he a half-god?

263
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:36,568
If gods were mortal,
he would be one.

264
00:18:36,691 --> 00:18:38,887
You forget
whose kingdom you inhabit.

265
00:18:39,011 --> 00:18:40,161
Yes.

266
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,362
Our god Dagon is mighty.

267
00:18:42,491 --> 00:18:43,925
Yes, he is.

268
00:18:44,051 --> 00:18:46,282
Would you kindly
give us some privacy?

269
00:18:52,691 --> 00:18:53,886
Sit.

270
00:18:59,811 --> 00:19:02,849
This is not Dagon's kingdom.

271
00:19:02,971 --> 00:19:05,406
'Tis mine.

272
00:19:05,531 --> 00:19:08,444
You must see gods
for what they are.

273
00:19:08,571 --> 00:19:10,961
They are symbols.

274
00:19:11,091 --> 00:19:13,083
They have no power.

275
00:19:13,211 --> 00:19:17,922
To the common man,
they provide something bigger.

276
00:19:18,051 --> 00:19:21,601
To us, they are means
of control.

277
00:19:21,771 --> 00:19:23,842
I am Dagon.

278
00:19:23,971 --> 00:19:25,849
You can be Dagon

279
00:19:25,971 --> 00:19:28,645
if you stomp out the spark
before it becomes a blaze.

280
00:19:28,771 --> 00:19:31,570
Yes, my king.
Huh.

281
00:19:31,691 --> 00:19:33,045
You may return.

282
00:19:33,171 --> 00:19:34,969
He will serve the crown,
or he will die.

283
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:36,491
I'm sure he will.

284
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:43,884
How did I know
I'd find you here?

285
00:19:44,011 --> 00:19:45,764
This is the best
view in all of Israel.

286
00:19:45,891 --> 00:19:47,371
You need to turn your eyes and mind

287
00:19:47,491 --> 00:19:48,641
towards things that matter,
brother.

288
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:50,364
I am appreciating
God's creation.

289
00:19:50,491 --> 00:19:52,767
What could possibly
be more important than that?

290
00:19:52,931 --> 00:19:54,206
Fulfilling your destiny.

291
00:19:54,331 --> 00:19:56,402
Becoming judge.
No, there is no judge.

292
00:19:56,531 --> 00:19:57,647
You carry the anointing.

293
00:19:57,811 --> 00:19:59,086
I'm not ready.

294
00:20:00,571 --> 00:20:02,563
We're never ready.

295
00:20:04,891 --> 00:20:06,325
What are you smiling at?

296
00:20:06,451 --> 00:20:08,408
I found her.

297
00:20:08,571 --> 00:20:10,403
Oh.

298
00:20:10,571 --> 00:20:12,563
Little brother, now,
this is good news.

299
00:20:12,691 --> 00:20:14,444
Her name is Taren.
She's in Gaza.

300
00:20:14,571 --> 00:20:16,210
And even worse,
she's a servant of Rallah.

301
00:20:16,371 --> 00:20:17,885
I must relieve her of that.

302
00:20:18,011 --> 00:20:19,365
No, you must not.
No, I must.

303
00:20:19,491 --> 00:20:20,891
One more thing.
What?

304
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,127
You must not tell Mother.

305
00:21:10,251 --> 00:21:12,083
Is everything all right?

306
00:21:14,811 --> 00:21:17,087
Forgive me. I just...

307
00:21:17,211 --> 00:21:18,406
Just what?

308
00:21:18,531 --> 00:21:20,409
You enjoy spying on people?

309
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:22,090
No.

310
00:21:22,211 --> 00:21:23,531
Not at all.

311
00:21:23,651 --> 00:21:26,086
I just had to know who you were.

312
00:21:26,211 --> 00:21:29,761
After seeing you at the fight,
my head was spinning.

313
00:21:31,451 --> 00:21:33,363
Are you sure that was not
because of his punch?

314
00:21:34,931 --> 00:21:37,048
No. The only reason
he landed that punch

315
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:40,084
was because
I was distracted... by you.

316
00:21:44,251 --> 00:21:45,924
They say that those
who tangle with you

317
00:21:46,051 --> 00:21:48,486
leave wishing they had not.

318
00:21:50,571 --> 00:21:53,325
The prince.
Um, I must go.

319
00:21:53,451 --> 00:21:55,647
Wait. Do you know the cliffs
by the beach?

320
00:21:55,771 --> 00:21:57,603
Where the path from Gaza
meets the sea?

321
00:21:58,691 --> 00:21:59,807
Yes.

322
00:21:59,971 --> 00:22:01,963
They are beautiful.

323
00:22:06,131 --> 00:22:09,522
Meet me there tomorrow
at first light.

324
00:22:09,691 --> 00:22:11,887
Please?

325
00:22:16,891 --> 00:22:18,166
How long must we wait for God

326
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:19,805
to deliver us
from this oppression?

327
00:22:19,931 --> 00:22:22,002
He has already revealed
His chosen one.

328
00:22:22,131 --> 00:22:23,724
It is Samson.

329
00:22:23,851 --> 00:22:26,002
Well, where is he, then?
He should be here.

330
00:22:26,131 --> 00:22:27,611
Samson does not want
to be judge.

331
00:22:27,731 --> 00:22:29,165
It is better this way.

332
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:31,522
He is unfit to lead.

333
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:34,371
How can God choose a barbarian
that chases after woman

334
00:22:34,491 --> 00:22:36,164
like it is his birthright?

335
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:39,523
And may I add,
I'm grateful he has eyes

336
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:41,563
for the Philistine maidens
and not our own.

337
00:22:41,691 --> 00:22:43,922
At least there is
a slight chance my own sister

338
00:22:44,051 --> 00:22:46,008
will be safe from his advances.

339
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:47,850
Your sister
would not have her virtue

340
00:22:47,971 --> 00:22:50,167
if not for the protection
given by my brother.

341
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:52,362
Shall I have him
remove it from you?

342
00:22:52,491 --> 00:22:54,369
From her?

343
00:22:54,491 --> 00:22:56,289
From all of you?

344
00:23:03,851 --> 00:23:06,491
<i>I was beginning to
wonder if you would show.</i>

345
00:23:06,611 --> 00:23:09,206
I used to play here as a child.

346
00:23:09,331 --> 00:23:11,607
Walk along the water
with my father.

347
00:23:11,731 --> 00:23:15,202
It's actually the only reason
I chose to come.

348
00:23:15,331 --> 00:23:18,130
Oh. Is that so?

349
00:23:18,251 --> 00:23:20,447
Yes, that is so.

350
00:23:20,571 --> 00:23:22,164
Do you consider me a liar?

351
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:25,170
No, I'm not saying
you would lie, but...

352
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:27,169
I mean, is that the only reason?

353
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:29,760
There is no other?

354
00:23:29,891 --> 00:23:33,487
Well, if you must know
the entire truth...

355
00:23:33,651 --> 00:23:35,483
then yes.

356
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,287
Are you coming or not?

357
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:47,720
Can I ask you something?

358
00:23:47,851 --> 00:23:49,171
Of course.

359
00:23:49,331 --> 00:23:50,651
Do you believe in destiny?

360
00:23:50,771 --> 00:23:53,889
That your life
can be decided for you

361
00:23:54,011 --> 00:23:55,923
even before you're born?

362
00:23:56,091 --> 00:23:57,844
Yes, I do.

363
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:00,771
Well, I do not.

364
00:24:00,891 --> 00:24:04,646
I refuse to be bound
by slavery of any kind.

365
00:24:04,771 --> 00:24:07,240
What about me and my people?

366
00:24:07,371 --> 00:24:11,251
Are we not slaves to
your people, the Philistines?

367
00:24:11,371 --> 00:24:14,045
We do not have the freedom
that you speak of.

368
00:24:15,171 --> 00:24:17,242
Our lives are our own.

369
00:24:17,371 --> 00:24:19,966
Our destiny
is what we make of it.

370
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:24,085
You're only a slave
if you let them make you one.

371
00:24:24,211 --> 00:24:26,931
If you think
that your current situation

372
00:24:27,051 --> 00:24:29,725
is any different than mine,

373
00:24:29,851 --> 00:24:32,002
you're wrong.

374
00:24:40,051 --> 00:24:41,804
<i>Tell me of your family.</i>

375
00:24:41,931 --> 00:24:45,163
<i>My mother was killed
when I was only a child,</i>

376
00:24:45,291 --> 00:24:47,044
and the prince
has enslaved my father

377
00:24:47,171 --> 00:24:49,288
until his debt is paid.

378
00:24:49,411 --> 00:24:51,448
I'm sorry.

379
00:24:51,571 --> 00:24:54,291
Your people are not
the only victims.

380
00:24:56,011 --> 00:24:58,287
All my life, it's been said
that I'm meant

381
00:24:58,411 --> 00:25:01,290
to lead my people to victory
against the Philistines.

382
00:25:01,411 --> 00:25:02,970
Us?

383
00:25:03,091 --> 00:25:05,560
My brethren are beaten, starved.

384
00:25:05,691 --> 00:25:07,808
Our livestock is stolen.

385
00:25:07,931 --> 00:25:11,402
This has gone on for years,
Taren, with no end in sight.

386
00:25:11,531 --> 00:25:14,410
Samson, we are enslaved
by the same people.

387
00:25:16,411 --> 00:25:18,687
Who do you want to be?

388
00:25:18,811 --> 00:25:20,609
Father.

389
00:25:21,891 --> 00:25:23,610
Husband.

390
00:25:29,011 --> 00:25:31,606
I believe you can be that man.

391
00:26:05,771 --> 00:26:08,286
Troubled?

392
00:26:08,411 --> 00:26:10,130
When the old man dies,

393
00:26:10,251 --> 00:26:11,924
should I declare a time
of mourning

394
00:26:12,051 --> 00:26:14,122
for the passing of a king?

395
00:26:14,251 --> 00:26:18,370
Or a time of celebration for
the coronation of a new one?

396
00:26:18,491 --> 00:26:21,450
Do you expect this tragedy soon?

397
00:26:23,211 --> 00:26:25,407
It does not matter.

398
00:26:25,571 --> 00:26:28,689
I will be rejoicing regardless.

399
00:26:32,251 --> 00:26:34,288
He thinks me unprepared
for the crown,

400
00:26:34,411 --> 00:26:36,243
and yet tasks me with the act

401
00:26:36,371 --> 00:26:38,840
of suppressing
a slave rebellion.

402
00:26:38,971 --> 00:26:41,406
It is a fool's errand.

403
00:26:41,531 --> 00:26:45,081
I should be leading armies
into Sidon, Midian, Egypt.

404
00:26:45,211 --> 00:26:49,285
These Hebrews are not worth
the time of a future king.

405
00:26:49,411 --> 00:26:50,811
My father...

406
00:26:52,331 --> 00:26:54,562
he grows senile in his old age.

407
00:26:54,691 --> 00:26:57,160
He's led our kingdom
into prosperity.

408
00:26:58,411 --> 00:27:01,051
Perhaps he deserves more honor.

409
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:08,848
Perhaps your prince
deserves more respect.

410
00:27:08,971 --> 00:27:11,088
You need more wine.

411
00:27:11,211 --> 00:27:13,646
If you wish to serve
as my queen,

412
00:27:13,771 --> 00:27:17,731
you will learn
to tame your tongue.

413
00:27:19,811 --> 00:27:22,371
Of course, my love.

414
00:27:24,171 --> 00:27:27,881
The throne will be ours soon...

415
00:27:28,051 --> 00:27:30,805
my Delilah.

416
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,169
<i>Why can't we show everyone</i>

417
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:48,010
<i>how Hebrews and Philistines
can live in peace?</i>

418
00:27:48,131 --> 00:27:49,645
<i>For the first time</i>

419
00:27:49,771 --> 00:27:53,685
in my life, someone asked
who I want to be.

420
00:27:53,811 --> 00:27:57,566
You made me believe in a future
I did not think I could have.

421
00:27:57,691 --> 00:27:59,808
Samson.

422
00:27:59,931 --> 00:28:02,651
This is our chance to be free.

423
00:28:05,771 --> 00:28:07,728
Taren...

424
00:28:07,851 --> 00:28:09,808
marry me.

425
00:28:13,771 --> 00:28:16,081
Your parents
will not approve of this.

426
00:28:16,211 --> 00:28:19,488
If you say yes,
I will stop at nothing

427
00:28:19,611 --> 00:28:21,728
until they give me
their blessing.

428
00:28:24,011 --> 00:28:25,331
Then yes.

429
00:28:25,451 --> 00:28:27,170
Yes? Yes?

430
00:28:39,731 --> 00:28:41,450
Oh...

431
00:28:46,371 --> 00:28:48,488
I met a girl.

432
00:28:48,611 --> 00:28:50,682
I want to marry her.

433
00:28:51,891 --> 00:28:55,009
Uh, what's her name?

434
00:28:55,131 --> 00:28:57,362
Her name is Taren.

435
00:28:57,491 --> 00:29:00,086
Uh, f-from our village?

436
00:29:00,211 --> 00:29:03,090
No, she is from Timnah.

437
00:29:04,171 --> 00:29:05,810
A Hebrew girl in Timnah?

438
00:29:05,931 --> 00:29:07,809
Who's her father?

439
00:29:07,931 --> 00:29:09,206
His name is Ahar.

440
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:10,890
He is a prisoner of the crown.

441
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:17,043
You couldn't find a suitable
bride in our own tribe?

442
00:29:17,171 --> 00:29:20,209
Instead, you choose
a daughter of the enemy?

443
00:29:20,371 --> 00:29:22,522
Have you lost your mind?

444
00:29:22,651 --> 00:29:24,802
I'm not trying to shame you,
Father. Or you, Mother.

445
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:26,843
You have no idea the brutality

446
00:29:26,971 --> 00:29:28,690
and horrors
they've brought on us.

447
00:29:28,811 --> 00:29:31,121
She is not like them.
She is different.

448
00:29:31,251 --> 00:29:33,322
We are their slaves.
If you marry her,

449
00:29:33,451 --> 00:29:36,205
you will bring shame
and dishonor to this family.

450
00:30:18,611 --> 00:30:21,251
What do You want from me?

451
00:30:24,051 --> 00:30:26,520
Am I called to lead Your people?

452
00:30:29,891 --> 00:30:32,042
Then show me a sign.

453
00:31:07,891 --> 00:31:09,007
No!

454
00:31:30,211 --> 00:31:32,567
You are my savior
and my strength.

455
00:31:32,691 --> 00:31:34,523
Forgive me, my Lord.

456
00:31:36,931 --> 00:31:38,524
Forgive me.

457
00:31:50,451 --> 00:31:53,250
Stop singing.
Hmm?

458
00:31:53,371 --> 00:31:55,363
Pardon me.
I did not see you.

459
00:32:00,371 --> 00:32:02,044
And what on earth is the cause

460
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:04,481
of all this smiling and singing?

461
00:32:05,811 --> 00:32:08,724
Does love not sing sweetly?

462
00:32:08,851 --> 00:32:10,808
Take my advice.

463
00:32:10,931 --> 00:32:13,890
Do not trust the love
of a Philistine.

464
00:32:14,011 --> 00:32:17,891
No, my love is a Hebrew
unlike any other man.

465
00:32:18,051 --> 00:32:20,885
And his love comes
with a proposal.

466
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:24,364
Marriage?

467
00:32:24,491 --> 00:32:27,882
You are a servant girl
to a Philistine king.

468
00:32:28,011 --> 00:32:29,923
Would it not be permitted?

469
00:32:30,051 --> 00:32:33,886
Our prince would never yield
his servant to a Hebrew.

470
00:32:34,011 --> 00:32:36,765
But he is respected
amongst his community,

471
00:32:36,891 --> 00:32:38,848
one of their leaders.

472
00:32:38,971 --> 00:32:41,611
And his name?

473
00:32:41,731 --> 00:32:43,131
Samson.

474
00:32:44,211 --> 00:32:46,407
Samson?

475
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:48,409
The strongman is your betrothed?

476
00:32:48,531 --> 00:32:50,204
Yes, milady.
Have you heard of him?

477
00:32:50,371 --> 00:32:52,169
I have.

478
00:32:52,331 --> 00:32:55,688
Perhaps I can help you.

479
00:32:55,811 --> 00:32:58,246
I will speak with Prince Rallah
on your behalf.

480
00:32:58,371 --> 00:33:00,408
You'd do that for me?

481
00:33:01,491 --> 00:33:03,050
Indeed.

482
00:33:03,171 --> 00:33:05,402
In the name of love.

483
00:33:05,531 --> 00:33:07,363
Thank you.

484
00:33:09,931 --> 00:33:11,809
<i>I have received reports</i>

485
00:33:11,931 --> 00:33:13,968
<i>that the Hebrews
are considering Samson</i>

486
00:33:14,091 --> 00:33:15,207
as judge.

487
00:33:15,331 --> 00:33:17,050
The judge of a slave
is still a slave.

488
00:33:17,171 --> 00:33:19,640
Let them do as they will.
What would the king say?

489
00:33:19,771 --> 00:33:23,321
What my father thinks
is of no concern to you.

490
00:33:23,491 --> 00:33:27,087
The Hebrew has eyes
for your new servant girl.

491
00:33:27,211 --> 00:33:31,000
Well, she is pleasing
to the eye.

492
00:33:31,131 --> 00:33:32,690
They plan to marry.

493
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:34,530
That would be heresy to Dagon.

494
00:33:34,651 --> 00:33:36,483
Wedding a Philistine
to a Hebrew?

495
00:33:36,611 --> 00:33:38,489
You cannot allow this, my lord.

496
00:33:38,611 --> 00:33:40,330
But if you were to bless
their union,

497
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:42,522
they would be in your debt.

498
00:33:46,971 --> 00:33:48,371
How do you mean?

499
00:33:48,491 --> 00:33:49,766
Give the girl to the Hebrew,

500
00:33:49,931 --> 00:33:52,082
and he will never raise
a hand against you.

501
00:33:52,211 --> 00:33:53,930
The throne would be yours.

502
00:33:54,051 --> 00:33:56,441
This is madness, my lord.

503
00:33:58,451 --> 00:34:00,363
He would be under my heel.

504
00:34:00,491 --> 00:34:02,960
Let Samson marry.

505
00:34:03,091 --> 00:34:04,889
We shall host the wedding feast.

506
00:34:05,011 --> 00:34:06,968
My queen is cunning.

507
00:34:07,091 --> 00:34:08,923
And my king strong.

508
00:34:09,051 --> 00:34:11,043
Ashdod, you may leave.

509
00:34:11,171 --> 00:34:12,810
Yes, my lord.

510
00:34:14,331 --> 00:34:16,800
Give me Samson,

511
00:34:16,931 --> 00:34:19,002
and the throne will be ours.

512
00:34:56,851 --> 00:34:58,365
<i>Out of the eater,</i>

513
00:34:58,491 --> 00:35:00,448
<i>something to eat.</i>

514
00:35:01,571 --> 00:35:03,722
<i>Out of the strong,</i>

515
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,968
<i>something sweet.</i>

516
00:35:08,291 --> 00:35:11,682
At least dance with
your bride-to-be once tonight.

517
00:35:11,811 --> 00:35:14,007
Or did you take a vow
against all fun?

518
00:35:14,131 --> 00:35:15,485
You dance.

519
00:35:15,611 --> 00:35:16,965
I will watch.

520
00:35:23,011 --> 00:35:23,967
Samson.

521
00:35:24,091 --> 00:35:25,969
My brother, you look sober.

522
00:35:26,091 --> 00:35:27,889
Here, have a drink.

523
00:35:28,011 --> 00:35:29,331
No. I do not drink.

524
00:35:29,491 --> 00:35:30,766
You do not drink?

525
00:35:30,891 --> 00:35:33,690
Only babies do not drink.

526
00:35:33,811 --> 00:35:36,406
Should we get him some milk,
maybe a wet nurse? Oh.

527
00:35:36,531 --> 00:35:38,443
I said no.
No wine for me.

528
00:35:38,571 --> 00:35:40,051
It is not wine.

529
00:35:40,211 --> 00:35:41,565
Drink with us.

530
00:35:41,691 --> 00:35:43,728
It's your wedding. Drink.

531
00:35:51,411 --> 00:35:52,527
You lied.

532
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:54,165
Just trying to have some fun.

533
00:35:56,371 --> 00:35:58,090
Impressive, Hebrew.

534
00:35:58,211 --> 00:35:59,964
We all know about your strength.

535
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:01,844
Is there anything more to you?

536
00:36:01,971 --> 00:36:04,486
Anything... between those ears?

537
00:36:05,971 --> 00:36:07,690
I have more than you do.

538
00:36:09,091 --> 00:36:11,481
Perhaps, uh, a riddle?
Yes.

539
00:36:11,611 --> 00:36:13,204
Yes? A riddle?

540
00:36:13,331 --> 00:36:16,688
At night, I come...

541
00:36:16,811 --> 00:36:19,770
without being called.

542
00:36:19,891 --> 00:36:23,567
By day, I am lost

543
00:36:23,691 --> 00:36:25,330
without being stolen.

544
00:36:26,731 --> 00:36:31,044
What... am... I?

545
00:36:37,011 --> 00:36:38,843
Too difficult?

546
00:36:40,571 --> 00:36:42,483
A star.

547
00:36:44,211 --> 00:36:46,407
All right, my turn.

548
00:36:48,251 --> 00:36:51,847
I have a riddle that I am sure
none of you can solve.

549
00:36:53,931 --> 00:36:57,129
You challenge 30 men
to a riddle?

550
00:36:57,251 --> 00:36:58,605
Fine.

551
00:36:58,731 --> 00:37:00,006
Perhaps a wager.

552
00:37:00,131 --> 00:37:02,009
My people need clothes.

553
00:37:02,131 --> 00:37:05,442
Your tunics... all of them.

554
00:37:08,491 --> 00:37:11,370
30 Philistine tunics.

555
00:37:11,491 --> 00:37:13,801
Fine.

556
00:37:13,971 --> 00:37:17,328
But if you lose,
you owe the same.

557
00:37:17,451 --> 00:37:19,488
And if you don't pay...

558
00:37:20,891 --> 00:37:23,486
it will be your head
or your wife's.

559
00:37:25,291 --> 00:37:27,123
Out of the eater,

560
00:37:27,251 --> 00:37:29,846
something to eat.

561
00:37:29,971 --> 00:37:32,122
Out of the strong,

562
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:35,323
something sweet.

563
00:37:36,451 --> 00:37:38,010
Is that it?

564
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:41,522
Is my slave wit
too much for you?

565
00:37:42,931 --> 00:37:44,843
You have until morning
to answer.

566
00:37:46,371 --> 00:37:48,044
Keep those clean, will you?

567
00:37:48,211 --> 00:37:50,089
Oh!

568
00:37:50,211 --> 00:37:51,167
Come on.

569
00:37:51,291 --> 00:37:52,327
Let us dance.

570
00:37:52,451 --> 00:37:53,328
Music.

571
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:04,085
<i>Did you really think</i>

572
00:38:04,211 --> 00:38:05,770
<i>I would just let you run off</i>

573
00:38:05,891 --> 00:38:10,170
and wed without anything
in return?

574
00:38:11,731 --> 00:38:14,724
"Out of the eater,
something to eat.

575
00:38:14,851 --> 00:38:18,527
Out of the strong,
something sweet."

576
00:38:19,971 --> 00:38:21,690
What does this mean to you?

577
00:38:21,811 --> 00:38:23,803
I know not what you speak of,
my lord.

578
00:38:25,371 --> 00:38:26,851
You lie.

579
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,611
I have watched you, you know?

580
00:38:29,731 --> 00:38:32,405
Seeing you talk to your father,

581
00:38:32,531 --> 00:38:35,330
that beast behind the bars.

582
00:38:35,451 --> 00:38:37,522
It is quite a beautiful bond
you have.

583
00:38:37,651 --> 00:38:39,085
Really extraordinary.

584
00:38:39,211 --> 00:38:40,725
What are you saying?

585
00:38:40,891 --> 00:38:43,929
It would be a shame

586
00:38:44,051 --> 00:38:47,123
if you never see him...

587
00:38:47,251 --> 00:38:48,970
again.

588
00:38:57,171 --> 00:38:59,640
<i>The riddle...</i>

589
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:01,490
it confounds them all.

590
00:39:01,611 --> 00:39:03,284
Rallah boasted of his wit,

591
00:39:03,451 --> 00:39:06,330
so I gave him and his men
something to think about.

592
00:39:06,451 --> 00:39:09,967
Let their small minds toil
while we have fun.

593
00:39:10,091 --> 00:39:11,650
And the answer?

594
00:39:11,771 --> 00:39:13,524
You will know soon enough.

595
00:39:15,691 --> 00:39:17,250
What bothers you so?

596
00:39:20,931 --> 00:39:22,490
Tomorrow, we'll be married.

597
00:39:22,611 --> 00:39:26,400
Husband and wife... there should
be no secrets between us.

598
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:28,011
No secrets.

599
00:39:28,131 --> 00:39:29,963
Right.

600
00:39:30,091 --> 00:39:32,083
No secrets.

601
00:39:32,211 --> 00:39:34,601
For what is sweeter than honey?

602
00:39:34,731 --> 00:39:37,849
And what is stronger
than a lion?

603
00:39:37,971 --> 00:39:39,530
There.

604
00:39:39,651 --> 00:39:41,882
Does that solve these troubles?

605
00:40:00,211 --> 00:40:01,850
Ah, there he is.

606
00:40:02,011 --> 00:40:05,687
A groom full of rare wit
and strength.

607
00:40:05,851 --> 00:40:07,171
At the bottom of which barrel

608
00:40:07,291 --> 00:40:08,645
did you find my answer?

609
00:40:09,771 --> 00:40:11,763
You would be surprised.

610
00:40:11,891 --> 00:40:13,723
Just try me.

611
00:40:15,691 --> 00:40:20,720
For what is sweeter than honey?

612
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:22,683
And what is stronger...

613
00:40:22,811 --> 00:40:25,007
than a lion?

614
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:27,009
How did you...
Remind me again,

615
00:40:27,131 --> 00:40:28,724
what was our wager?

616
00:40:28,851 --> 00:40:29,887
Oh, yes.

617
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:31,240
30 tunics.

618
00:40:31,371 --> 00:40:32,930
I do not have them.

619
00:40:33,051 --> 00:40:34,963
Well, then I fear you lose
more than your wager.

620
00:40:35,131 --> 00:40:36,611
Samson.
Do not touch her!

621
00:40:39,291 --> 00:40:40,805
Fine.

622
00:40:40,931 --> 00:40:42,843
I will find your tunics.

623
00:40:43,011 --> 00:40:45,321
Samson, please.

624
00:40:46,491 --> 00:40:47,561
It wasn't me.

625
00:40:47,691 --> 00:40:49,444
It wasn't me, Samson.

626
00:41:27,491 --> 00:41:28,925
Oi!

627
00:41:30,251 --> 00:41:32,846
That water's not for you,
Hebrew.

628
00:41:35,211 --> 00:41:39,091
This well
is for pure Philistine lips.

629
00:41:39,211 --> 00:41:42,170
Have it fouled
by the likes of you

630
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,964
makes me sick.

631
00:41:54,451 --> 00:41:56,044
I said...

632
00:41:56,211 --> 00:41:58,965
get your dirty hands
off our water

633
00:41:59,131 --> 00:42:01,202
and move along!

634
00:42:06,371 --> 00:42:09,091
Give me your tunic.
What did you say?

635
00:42:11,731 --> 00:42:13,609
Your tunic.

636
00:42:13,771 --> 00:42:15,091
Give it to me.

637
00:42:15,211 --> 00:42:18,841
Have you lost your mind, Hebrew?

638
00:42:18,971 --> 00:42:21,611
I could leave your corpse here
for the crows

639
00:42:21,731 --> 00:42:25,042
and finish my drink
without a second thought!

640
00:42:32,531 --> 00:42:33,851
Hey.

641
00:42:50,131 --> 00:42:51,645
He's dead.

642
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:55,691
He's dead.

643
00:43:06,931 --> 00:43:08,490
Your tunics.

644
00:43:08,611 --> 00:43:11,570
I want all of them.

645
00:43:13,251 --> 00:43:14,731
He's insane.

646
00:43:14,851 --> 00:43:16,570
Put this dog down.

647
00:44:17,251 --> 00:44:19,163
They cannot hurt you anymore.

648
00:44:19,291 --> 00:44:22,125
You're free.

649
00:44:22,251 --> 00:44:24,083
It's me, Samson.

650
00:44:24,211 --> 00:44:25,964
Our God was with us today.

651
00:44:28,211 --> 00:44:30,168
Help me gather their tunics.

652
00:44:31,611 --> 00:44:33,091
Wait.

653
00:44:33,211 --> 00:44:34,088
Please.

654
00:44:34,211 --> 00:44:36,771
I cannot touch the dead.

655
00:44:37,851 --> 00:44:39,808
I cannot break my vow.

656
00:44:55,491 --> 00:44:58,689
Rallah! Rallah!

657
00:45:05,211 --> 00:45:06,884
My debt is paid.

658
00:45:07,011 --> 00:45:08,843
Now, where is Taren?

659
00:45:08,971 --> 00:45:11,088
Philistine tunics, sir.

660
00:45:11,211 --> 00:45:13,009
There is blood.

661
00:45:13,131 --> 00:45:16,249
Where is my wife?

662
00:45:17,451 --> 00:45:19,204
You have no wife.

663
00:45:19,371 --> 00:45:22,728
You did not return in time
to finish the ceremony.

664
00:45:22,851 --> 00:45:26,561
Dagon law requires,
once a wedding has begun,

665
00:45:26,691 --> 00:45:28,648
it must be completed.

666
00:45:30,931 --> 00:45:33,241
I had to stand in your place.

667
00:45:33,371 --> 00:45:34,885
If you even touched her...
Uh...

668
00:45:35,051 --> 00:45:37,725
Now, since you've murdered my men

669
00:45:37,891 --> 00:45:40,201
and stolen their clothes,
you will spend the rest

670
00:45:40,331 --> 00:45:43,802
of your very short life
working in the mines.

671
00:45:47,491 --> 00:45:49,050
Arrest this man.

672
00:46:03,571 --> 00:46:05,164
Get back here, Samson!

673
00:46:05,331 --> 00:46:06,651
Get him!

674
00:47:08,531 --> 00:47:10,523
The crops are burning.

675
00:47:10,691 --> 00:47:12,125
Why do you stand there?

676
00:47:12,251 --> 00:47:13,890
Draw your bows.

677
00:47:14,011 --> 00:47:15,889
There's no one there, sir.

678
00:47:16,011 --> 00:47:17,604
What?

679
00:47:19,291 --> 00:47:21,283
Then who starts the fires?

680
00:47:21,451 --> 00:47:23,124
The fire, it moves on its own.

681
00:47:23,251 --> 00:47:24,810
Wake the prince.

682
00:47:33,811 --> 00:47:35,643
What is this?

683
00:47:38,451 --> 00:47:40,124
Rallah!

684
00:47:40,251 --> 00:47:41,765
Release Taren!

685
00:47:41,931 --> 00:47:45,322
Or all your fields will burn!

686
00:47:53,451 --> 00:47:55,647
Samson!

687
00:47:55,771 --> 00:47:56,887
No!

688
00:47:57,011 --> 00:47:58,240
Hebrew!

689
00:47:58,371 --> 00:47:59,407
Taren!

690
00:47:59,571 --> 00:48:01,130
I release them!

691
00:48:01,251 --> 00:48:03,049
Samson!

692
00:48:04,811 --> 00:48:06,370
Taren!

693
00:48:50,011 --> 00:48:51,843
Forgive me.

694
00:49:00,651 --> 00:49:02,608
<i>Samson!</i>

695
00:49:05,411 --> 00:49:06,731
Samson!

696
00:49:06,891 --> 00:49:07,961
No!

697
00:49:08,091 --> 00:49:09,525
Samson!

698
00:49:10,811 --> 00:49:12,291
I don't know.
Samson!

699
00:49:13,851 --> 00:49:17,447
Give me Samson,
or your village burns.

700
00:49:18,931 --> 00:49:20,729
He's not here.

701
00:49:20,851 --> 00:49:22,171
I know you.

702
00:49:22,291 --> 00:49:25,204
Manoah, father of Samson.

703
00:49:25,331 --> 00:49:26,731
Take him.

704
00:49:29,451 --> 00:49:33,331
Are you sure you want
to bring all of Judah

705
00:49:33,451 --> 00:49:35,283
into a war against you?

706
00:49:35,411 --> 00:49:38,290
If Samson does not show,

707
00:49:38,411 --> 00:49:40,971
he will find himself
without a father.

708
00:49:41,131 --> 00:49:44,568
And you will find yourselves
without a village.

709
00:49:47,771 --> 00:49:49,524
Father...

710
00:49:51,091 --> 00:49:53,367
I think I know where he is.

711
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:56,051
Go. Go.

712
00:50:08,091 --> 00:50:10,367
Brother.

713
00:50:10,491 --> 00:50:11,811
Please leave me.

714
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:14,849
God's not done with you.

715
00:50:17,331 --> 00:50:20,290
For years, I pleaded with God.

716
00:50:22,331 --> 00:50:25,722
I asked Him if you're truly
the one to deliver us all.

717
00:50:27,091 --> 00:50:29,925
For years,
I'd never hear anything.

718
00:50:30,051 --> 00:50:33,203
And then, one night...

719
00:50:33,331 --> 00:50:35,891
I heard a still, small voice.

720
00:50:36,971 --> 00:50:38,451
I looked around. I was...

721
00:50:38,571 --> 00:50:41,325
certain someone
had spoken words,

722
00:50:41,451 --> 00:50:43,329
but there was no one there.

723
00:50:45,291 --> 00:50:47,248
And then it happened again.

724
00:50:47,371 --> 00:50:49,488
A voice so clear,

725
00:50:49,611 --> 00:50:52,809
a voice with divine certainty
that said

726
00:50:52,931 --> 00:50:55,366
I would witness my brother
free our people

727
00:50:55,491 --> 00:50:56,925
with the strength of his hands.

728
00:50:57,051 --> 00:51:00,761
I know that you will save us,
brother.

729
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,803
The only question is when.

730
00:51:05,091 --> 00:51:07,811
I have broken my vows.

731
00:51:07,971 --> 00:51:10,281
It is over.

732
00:51:10,411 --> 00:51:12,289
It's not over.

733
00:51:13,371 --> 00:51:15,442
Summon your strength, brother.

734
00:51:17,651 --> 00:51:20,246
They have Father.

735
00:51:24,091 --> 00:51:26,811
They've come here
to hand you over to the crown

736
00:51:26,931 --> 00:51:28,888
in exchange for peace.

737
00:51:29,971 --> 00:51:31,963
And if I surrender,

738
00:51:32,091 --> 00:51:33,969
will Rallah free Father?

739
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,003
Surrender's not the solution,
brother.

740
00:51:36,131 --> 00:51:37,485
Then what is?

741
00:51:37,611 --> 00:51:39,921
Make the men of Judah your army.

742
00:51:40,051 --> 00:51:43,123
They will fight for you,
and so will we.

743
00:51:43,251 --> 00:51:45,288
Today's the day, Samson.

744
00:51:45,411 --> 00:51:47,368
Today, the prophecy
is fulfilled.

745
00:51:47,491 --> 00:51:50,006
You are Samson
of the tribe of Dan,

746
00:51:50,131 --> 00:51:53,090
chosen by God Almighty
and set apart.

747
00:51:53,211 --> 00:51:56,488
His hand of vengeance
against the Philistines.

748
00:51:56,611 --> 00:51:58,967
You are right, brother.

749
00:51:59,091 --> 00:52:01,686
My hands will save our people.

750
00:52:02,811 --> 00:52:04,723
No, brother.

751
00:52:06,451 --> 00:52:07,771
No.

752
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:10,008
Stand and fight.

753
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:56,568
Your loyalty to
the king is acknowledged.

754
00:52:56,691 --> 00:52:58,842
Your village will be spared.

755
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:20,126
Before your head
hits the ground,

756
00:53:20,251 --> 00:53:22,402
your village will burn.

757
00:53:22,531 --> 00:53:25,171
And your father...

758
00:53:28,331 --> 00:53:30,846
will be waiting for you.

759
00:53:36,211 --> 00:53:38,043
No!

760
00:53:52,091 --> 00:53:54,606
No...!

761
00:53:58,451 --> 00:54:00,090
Draw!

762
00:54:06,571 --> 00:54:08,528
Protect the prince!

763
00:54:08,691 --> 00:54:10,364
Kill the Hebrew!

764
00:54:15,611 --> 00:54:18,604
God, give me strength.

765
00:54:44,411 --> 00:54:46,880
Move! He's mine!

766
00:54:55,611 --> 00:54:57,250
Go.

767
00:54:57,371 --> 00:55:00,569
Bring me his head!

768
00:55:47,171 --> 00:55:50,209
Lord, hear my prayer.

769
00:56:10,571 --> 00:56:12,005
Get him!

770
00:56:16,611 --> 00:56:18,568
He's only one man!

771
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:37,843
Get him! Get him!

772
00:56:39,131 --> 00:56:41,123
He's defeated!

773
00:56:45,691 --> 00:56:48,923
Lord, I'm Your humble servant.

774
00:56:49,051 --> 00:56:50,963
Do not abandon me now.

775
00:56:51,091 --> 00:56:52,764
Be my strength.

776
00:56:52,891 --> 00:56:56,771
Be... my... strength!

777
00:57:27,931 --> 00:57:30,127
His God is with him.

778
00:57:30,251 --> 00:57:31,321
He's invincible!

779
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:44,881
Samson.

780
00:58:48,571 --> 00:58:50,324
Dagon!

781
01:00:00,451 --> 01:00:02,886
Samson...

782
01:00:03,011 --> 01:00:04,650
son of Manoah,

783
01:00:04,771 --> 01:00:07,684
chosen by God since birth

784
01:00:07,811 --> 01:00:10,201
to bring deliverance
to your people.

785
01:00:17,811 --> 01:00:19,643
I anoint you.

786
01:01:02,411 --> 01:01:05,563
<i>He has the strength of a god.</i>

787
01:01:05,731 --> 01:01:09,407
I saw it with my own eyes.
Your eye deceives you.

788
01:01:09,571 --> 01:01:10,925
Did you see him bleed?

789
01:01:11,051 --> 01:01:12,644
Yes.

790
01:01:12,771 --> 01:01:14,649
Then he is not a god!

791
01:01:14,771 --> 01:01:18,651
Go tell the Hebrews
that we will not retaliate

792
01:01:18,771 --> 01:01:22,447
if Samson swears
to end his violence!

793
01:01:23,531 --> 01:01:26,251
Go. Get out of my sight, boy.

794
01:01:27,491 --> 01:01:29,562
You child!

795
01:01:43,611 --> 01:01:45,091
You... are... not...

796
01:01:45,211 --> 01:01:47,248
a... god!

797
01:01:51,811 --> 01:01:54,007
You risk Dagon's wrath.

798
01:01:54,131 --> 01:01:57,010
I do not fear Dagon
or my father.

799
01:01:57,131 --> 01:01:59,202
You fear another.

800
01:01:59,371 --> 01:02:03,684
I have seen a real god...

801
01:02:03,811 --> 01:02:06,087
in a real man.

802
01:02:10,571 --> 01:02:12,403
That is power.

803
01:02:12,531 --> 01:02:16,286
I will take Samson's power.

804
01:02:19,091 --> 01:02:21,651
And you're going to help me.

805
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:33,288
<i>Samson was at last anointed</i>

806
01:02:33,411 --> 01:02:36,722
<i>the judge and protector
of our people.</i>

807
01:02:36,851 --> 01:02:40,003
<i>The king sent
no army against us,</i>

808
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:43,522
<i>but the theft of our food
did not stop.</i>

809
01:02:43,651 --> 01:02:46,007
<i>Prince Rallah was sent
far to the west</i>

810
01:02:46,131 --> 01:02:50,011
<i>to lead campaigns into Egypt
as punishment.</i>

811
01:02:50,171 --> 01:02:53,130
<i>But upon his return,
years later,</i>

812
01:02:53,251 --> 01:02:56,369
<i>our tribes were once again
beset with violence</i>

813
01:02:56,491 --> 01:02:59,325
<i>and pushed to the brink
of starvation.</i>

814
01:02:59,451 --> 01:03:01,283
<i>For years, I have said</i>

815
01:03:01,411 --> 01:03:03,289
our only hope is in peace.
Peace?

816
01:03:03,411 --> 01:03:05,971
Our share of the coming harvest
can no longer feed us.

817
01:03:06,091 --> 01:03:08,845
For years,
we have listened to you.

818
01:03:08,971 --> 01:03:12,009
We have barely endured,
yet nothing has changed.

819
01:03:12,131 --> 01:03:13,724
It's time for war.
No.

820
01:03:13,851 --> 01:03:16,082
War only brings suffering
to our people.

821
01:03:16,211 --> 01:03:18,680
I will leave to Gaza
to negotiate peace.

822
01:03:18,811 --> 01:03:21,770
What you call peace,
I call starvation.

823
01:03:21,891 --> 01:03:25,043
Our only hope is
to rally the other tribes

824
01:03:25,171 --> 01:03:26,491
and prepare for an attack.

825
01:03:26,611 --> 01:03:28,091
God did not
call you from the womb

826
01:03:28,251 --> 01:03:30,004
to be a politician, brother.

827
01:03:30,171 --> 01:03:33,721
He gave you the strength
to fight like no man ever has.

828
01:03:33,851 --> 01:03:38,880
I will return with freedom,
or I will not return at all.

829
01:04:09,771 --> 01:04:12,206
<i>This is an outrage.</i>

830
01:04:12,331 --> 01:04:13,606
I determine what is outrage.

831
01:04:13,731 --> 01:04:15,962
I define what is at risk
to my kingdom.

832
01:04:16,131 --> 01:04:17,770
He comes here to negotiate.

833
01:04:17,891 --> 01:04:21,089
He will leave in peace
because it is my wish,

834
01:04:21,211 --> 01:04:22,565
thus my command,

835
01:04:22,691 --> 01:04:24,683
my decree, my authority.

836
01:04:24,811 --> 01:04:26,689
Do you not see
where this argument is going?

837
01:04:26,851 --> 01:04:28,080
To the door.

838
01:04:30,171 --> 01:04:32,288
Rallah.

839
01:04:32,411 --> 01:04:34,004
You returned.

840
01:04:39,131 --> 01:04:41,521
Mighty Samson.

841
01:04:41,651 --> 01:04:43,608
At last we meet.

842
01:04:43,731 --> 01:04:46,166
May I offer you some wine
or some food?

843
01:04:46,291 --> 01:04:49,648
A jawbone of a donkey, perhaps.

844
01:04:49,771 --> 01:04:52,002
My son is around here
somewhere, is he not?

845
01:04:53,291 --> 01:04:54,281
I'm here to negotiate

846
01:04:54,411 --> 01:04:56,164
for the people I serve.

847
01:04:56,291 --> 01:04:58,123
The same people you starve.

848
01:04:58,251 --> 01:05:00,766
In order to negotiate,
one must have something

849
01:05:00,891 --> 01:05:03,087
to negotiate with, must he not?

850
01:05:03,211 --> 01:05:05,567
What do you have
to offer my kingdom?

851
01:05:05,691 --> 01:05:07,091
Peace.

852
01:05:07,211 --> 01:05:09,806
True peace between our people.

853
01:05:09,931 --> 01:05:11,650
Reduce the tribute.

854
01:05:11,811 --> 01:05:13,882
Give back the harvest
that is rightfully ours.

855
01:05:14,011 --> 01:05:15,843
Or else what?

856
01:05:15,971 --> 01:05:18,850
You will face the wrath of God.

857
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:25,131
So you threaten me
with natural phenomenon,

858
01:05:25,251 --> 01:05:28,244
freakish acts and the weather?

859
01:05:28,411 --> 01:05:30,482
Mock me if you will,

860
01:05:30,611 --> 01:05:32,568
but you will not be laughing
when you have

861
01:05:32,691 --> 01:05:34,569
another thousand soldiers
to bury.

862
01:05:34,691 --> 01:05:36,762
I have rebuilt my army
three times since,

863
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:38,848
and the only reason
that you draw breath

864
01:05:38,971 --> 01:05:41,281
is because I have not given
the order to take it.

865
01:05:41,411 --> 01:05:43,289
I reject your offer.

866
01:05:43,411 --> 01:05:44,811
Then you choose war.

867
01:05:44,971 --> 01:05:46,610
I think we both know

868
01:05:46,731 --> 01:05:51,567
that war is not
in your best interest.

869
01:05:51,691 --> 01:05:53,045
Unless, of course,
you choose to see

870
01:05:53,171 --> 01:05:54,321
more of your loved ones perish.

871
01:05:54,451 --> 01:05:56,488
This is my offer to you.

872
01:06:00,731 --> 01:06:02,085
Disappear.

873
01:06:03,171 --> 01:06:05,049
You disappear,

874
01:06:05,171 --> 01:06:07,970
and the harvest will be
returned to your people.

875
01:06:10,011 --> 01:06:12,810
You ask me to leave my people?

876
01:06:15,411 --> 01:06:18,722
You have a choice, Samson.

877
01:06:18,851 --> 01:06:24,370
Stay and watch
your people suffer and die,

878
01:06:24,491 --> 01:06:26,642
or go away

879
01:06:26,771 --> 01:06:28,410
and have them flourish.

880
01:06:38,331 --> 01:06:40,163
Make haste out of the city.

881
01:06:40,291 --> 01:06:42,362
Tell my brother.

882
01:06:42,491 --> 01:06:45,962
Tell him I'll return
when I change the king's heart.

883
01:06:46,091 --> 01:06:47,923
But you cannot linger here.

884
01:06:48,051 --> 01:06:50,441
If these people
even suspect who you are...

885
01:06:50,571 --> 01:06:52,449
Trust in God.

886
01:06:52,571 --> 01:06:54,085
He will show us the way.
Now, go.

887
01:06:54,211 --> 01:06:55,361
Hurry.

888
01:06:59,371 --> 01:07:02,409
A Hebrew who sits
in council with the king.

889
01:07:02,531 --> 01:07:04,443
You must be mistaken.

890
01:07:04,571 --> 01:07:06,642
My lord, forgive my manners.

891
01:07:06,771 --> 01:07:09,047
I'm the proprietor
of a nearby inn

892
01:07:09,171 --> 01:07:13,563
where important men like you
can rest and pray.

893
01:07:13,691 --> 01:07:15,045
We're very discreet.

894
01:07:15,171 --> 01:07:17,049
We ask no questions.

895
01:07:41,451 --> 01:07:43,170
What manner of inn is this?

896
01:07:43,291 --> 01:07:45,851
Nothing indecent,
I promise, my lord.

897
01:08:13,611 --> 01:08:15,091
I never would have come here

898
01:08:15,211 --> 01:08:18,283
had you been honest
about the sort of inn you run.

899
01:08:18,411 --> 01:08:20,004
I must speak with you.

900
01:08:20,131 --> 01:08:22,441
You're in the wrong room.
Go back to your madam.

901
01:08:22,571 --> 01:08:24,244
Samson, please.

902
01:08:26,331 --> 01:08:27,970
I've come here to warn you.

903
01:08:28,131 --> 01:08:30,043
You're in grave danger.

904
01:08:31,331 --> 01:08:34,005
Wait.

905
01:08:34,131 --> 01:08:35,884
I know you.

906
01:08:37,491 --> 01:08:39,164
Yes.

907
01:08:39,291 --> 01:08:41,123
You were at my wedding feast.

908
01:08:41,251 --> 01:08:42,970
You were with Rallah.

909
01:08:43,091 --> 01:08:45,401
Yes, I was.

910
01:08:45,531 --> 01:08:47,921
But that was before I knew
what he was capable of.

911
01:08:49,811 --> 01:08:51,086
I've since left his service.

912
01:08:51,211 --> 01:08:53,487
What are you doing here?

913
01:08:53,611 --> 01:08:55,921
I saw you on the street
by chance.

914
01:08:56,051 --> 01:08:57,644
I saw you enter here.

915
01:08:57,771 --> 01:09:00,605
Where is he? Hebrew!

916
01:09:00,731 --> 01:09:01,687
Samson, the city knows
you're here.

917
01:09:01,811 --> 01:09:03,245
The people are hunting

918
01:09:03,371 --> 01:09:04,885
for you even now, laying traps.

919
01:09:05,011 --> 01:09:07,526
Go find him!

920
01:09:10,731 --> 01:09:12,609
Did Rallah put you up to this?

921
01:09:12,731 --> 01:09:14,802
I'm not with Rallah.

922
01:09:14,971 --> 01:09:16,200
I don't believe you.

923
01:09:16,331 --> 01:09:18,243
You're lying.
Over there!

924
01:09:18,371 --> 01:09:20,806
Why would you help me?

925
01:09:20,931 --> 01:09:24,607
Will you be so cruel
to make me lay my heart bare?

926
01:09:26,211 --> 01:09:28,203
I spoke no lie.

927
01:09:31,091 --> 01:09:34,050
I saw you in the street,
and I remembered.

928
01:09:37,571 --> 01:09:39,369
Taren...

929
01:09:42,851 --> 01:09:45,241
What about Taren?

930
01:09:50,251 --> 01:09:53,050
She was sweet.

931
01:09:53,171 --> 01:09:54,651
And innocent.

932
01:09:54,771 --> 01:09:56,364
And pure.

933
01:09:58,531 --> 01:10:00,363
And for that,
the gods smiled on her

934
01:10:00,491 --> 01:10:03,086
and gave her the gift
of a good man.

935
01:10:05,571 --> 01:10:08,131
And I envied her, for I knew
I would never be allowed

936
01:10:08,251 --> 01:10:09,731
such a gift.

937
01:10:11,131 --> 01:10:12,770
Broken as I am.

938
01:10:17,611 --> 01:10:19,807
Forgive me.

939
01:10:19,931 --> 01:10:21,490
He's awake.

940
01:10:22,731 --> 01:10:23,960
You're not one of my girls.

941
01:10:24,091 --> 01:10:25,411
Kill them both!

942
01:10:25,531 --> 01:10:27,011
Come.

943
01:10:28,651 --> 01:10:30,404
That's him.

944
01:10:30,531 --> 01:10:32,807
The Hebrew killer Samson.
Find him. Where is he?

945
01:10:32,931 --> 01:10:35,366
Avenge your brothers
and your sons. Kill him!

946
01:10:36,931 --> 01:10:39,048
Kill him!

947
01:10:41,891 --> 01:10:43,769
In here.

948
01:10:45,051 --> 01:10:47,168
Where is he?

949
01:10:47,291 --> 01:10:49,248
Find him!

950
01:10:51,011 --> 01:10:52,923
Hurry, now!

951
01:10:55,091 --> 01:10:56,810
He killed my brother!

952
01:10:56,931 --> 01:10:58,331
Find him!

953
01:11:00,051 --> 01:11:01,929
Down the road! Go!

954
01:11:09,171 --> 01:11:10,810
What am I doing?

955
01:11:12,331 --> 01:11:14,800
I cannot go back
to my people as a failure.

956
01:11:14,931 --> 01:11:16,160
I cannot stay here.

957
01:11:16,291 --> 01:11:17,850
The king advises me to vanish.

958
01:11:18,011 --> 01:11:19,730
God tells me nothing!

959
01:11:24,291 --> 01:11:26,203
I have a house
in the valley of Sorek.

960
01:11:26,331 --> 01:11:30,245
You'll be safe there while you
wait for your God's answer.

961
01:11:33,931 --> 01:11:35,365
There he is!

962
01:11:36,691 --> 01:11:38,410
Make for the village of Balsam.

963
01:11:38,571 --> 01:11:40,483
I will meet you on the road.
Come on, then!

964
01:11:40,611 --> 01:11:42,091
Stay here tonight.

965
01:11:42,211 --> 01:11:43,850
They're not after you.

966
01:11:47,451 --> 01:11:48,805
Get him!

967
01:11:59,611 --> 01:12:01,489
Where is he?

968
01:12:01,611 --> 01:12:04,251
When I find him,
he's gonna be a dead man.

969
01:12:06,891 --> 01:12:08,325
He must have gone that way.

970
01:12:10,251 --> 01:12:12,208
We need to find him!

971
01:12:12,331 --> 01:12:13,765
Where is he?

972
01:12:15,051 --> 01:12:16,201
He's here!

973
01:12:16,331 --> 01:12:17,970
Rally to me!

974
01:12:18,091 --> 01:12:20,322
I see him!

975
01:12:20,491 --> 01:12:22,050
Rally to me!

976
01:12:23,411 --> 01:12:24,765
Rally to me!

977
01:12:29,851 --> 01:12:32,844
He's here! Rally to me!

978
01:12:50,131 --> 01:12:51,724
Don't let him get away!

979
01:12:53,411 --> 01:12:55,767
Catch him! Catch him!
Kill the heathen!

980
01:12:55,891 --> 01:12:58,281
Kill him! Kill him!

981
01:12:58,411 --> 01:13:00,209
Kill him!

982
01:13:01,731 --> 01:13:03,006
Kill the heathen!

983
01:13:04,571 --> 01:13:06,290
Catch him!

984
01:13:25,611 --> 01:13:28,126
Fire on that dirty pig!

985
01:13:30,851 --> 01:13:31,967
Kill the heathen!

986
01:13:36,091 --> 01:13:37,605
Kill him!

987
01:13:41,851 --> 01:13:43,649
Kill the heathen!

988
01:13:43,771 --> 01:13:46,331
Burn him!

989
01:13:48,451 --> 01:13:49,771
Kill him!

990
01:13:49,891 --> 01:13:51,371
Kill him!

991
01:13:53,851 --> 01:13:55,444
Lord...

992
01:13:55,571 --> 01:13:58,325
Your servant calls
upon You once more.

993
01:13:59,411 --> 01:14:01,209
Kill him!

994
01:14:01,331 --> 01:14:04,403
With Your strength,

995
01:14:04,531 --> 01:14:06,090
protect me.

996
01:14:54,691 --> 01:14:56,410
Let them witness.

997
01:14:57,931 --> 01:15:00,207
Let them witness the strength...

998
01:15:01,491 --> 01:15:02,811
of the Living...

999
01:15:04,211 --> 01:15:05,964
God.

1000
01:16:19,531 --> 01:16:21,124
<i>Samson.</i>

1001
01:16:27,851 --> 01:16:29,251
Taren.

1002
01:16:29,371 --> 01:16:31,681
My love.

1003
01:16:35,771 --> 01:16:36,887
What are you doing?

1004
01:16:37,011 --> 01:16:39,162
Lay still.

1005
01:16:39,331 --> 01:16:41,402
You must rest.

1006
01:16:58,651 --> 01:16:59,926
You're awake.

1007
01:17:00,051 --> 01:17:02,964
You have been asleep
for two days.

1008
01:17:03,091 --> 01:17:06,368
Your wounds were grave,
but I did what I could.

1009
01:17:06,491 --> 01:17:09,450
I thought you were someone else.

1010
01:17:09,611 --> 01:17:11,091
Taren.

1011
01:17:11,211 --> 01:17:14,249
You said her name many times.

1012
01:17:14,411 --> 01:17:15,891
You truly loved her.

1013
01:17:16,011 --> 01:17:17,730
Why do you help me?

1014
01:17:17,851 --> 01:17:19,922
Are you not a Philistine?

1015
01:17:20,051 --> 01:17:22,566
I found you alone and in pain.

1016
01:17:22,691 --> 01:17:24,967
I know what that feels like.

1017
01:17:25,091 --> 01:17:28,880
And you would help someone
without anything in return?

1018
01:17:30,291 --> 01:17:32,283
Takes a woman
full of true kindness

1019
01:17:32,411 --> 01:17:35,404
to do such things,
especially for a Hebrew.

1020
01:17:42,731 --> 01:17:44,290
I must go.

1021
01:17:45,811 --> 01:17:47,530
Please,
stay until you are healed.

1022
01:17:47,691 --> 01:17:49,205
I should not impose any further.

1023
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:50,811
It is no imposition.

1024
01:17:50,931 --> 01:17:52,843
Let me prepare you some food.

1025
01:17:52,971 --> 01:17:54,451
Please stay.

1026
01:17:55,851 --> 01:17:57,524
What is your name?

1027
01:17:58,611 --> 01:18:00,045
Delilah.

1028
01:18:01,131 --> 01:18:03,600
Delilah...

1029
01:18:03,731 --> 01:18:05,927
I owe you my life.

1030
01:18:07,011 --> 01:18:08,411
Thank you.

1031
01:18:25,211 --> 01:18:27,680
I thought you were dead.

1032
01:18:27,811 --> 01:18:29,325
I feel I should be, Mother.

1033
01:18:29,451 --> 01:18:30,601
Come here, son.

1034
01:18:30,731 --> 01:18:31,926
Sit down, sit down.

1035
01:18:32,051 --> 01:18:33,963
I'll get some food.

1036
01:18:36,291 --> 01:18:38,567
I have not protected
those I love.

1037
01:18:38,691 --> 01:18:40,569
God has protected us, Samson.

1038
01:18:40,691 --> 01:18:42,967
I have broken my vows to God.

1039
01:18:44,371 --> 01:18:46,283
I have killed.

1040
01:18:46,411 --> 01:18:48,767
Drank of the vine.

1041
01:18:50,971 --> 01:18:52,451
Has God forsaken me?

1042
01:18:52,571 --> 01:18:54,051
He will never forsake you.

1043
01:18:54,171 --> 01:18:55,730
He will always forgive.

1044
01:18:55,851 --> 01:18:58,002
I am beyond His forgiveness.

1045
01:18:58,131 --> 01:19:00,202
Oh, son, listen.

1046
01:19:00,331 --> 01:19:03,085
Within God's forgiveness
is His power.

1047
01:19:03,211 --> 01:19:04,486
And your call.

1048
01:19:04,611 --> 01:19:06,125
He's still with you,

1049
01:19:06,251 --> 01:19:09,642
but you must pursue
His desires, not your own.

1050
01:19:09,771 --> 01:19:11,763
Listen to Him.

1051
01:19:12,931 --> 01:19:14,684
Please...

1052
01:19:14,811 --> 01:19:16,325
pray for me.

1053
01:19:16,491 --> 01:19:19,768
I always pray for my children.

1054
01:19:32,531 --> 01:19:34,807
We'll be back
tomorrow for the rest.

1055
01:19:41,691 --> 01:19:43,410
We trusted you.

1056
01:19:44,691 --> 01:19:47,763
And you stand there
and do nothing.

1057
01:20:06,651 --> 01:20:08,961
When Samson killed the thousand,

1058
01:20:09,091 --> 01:20:11,083
we gathered as many weapons
as possible.

1059
01:20:11,251 --> 01:20:13,561
The majority remain hidden
in the woods.

1060
01:20:13,691 --> 01:20:16,570
Well done, Caleb.
We can't wait anymore.

1061
01:20:16,691 --> 01:20:19,160
This sword has not seen
a Hebrew hand for a generation.

1062
01:20:19,291 --> 01:20:22,125
And that is far too long,
my friend.

1063
01:20:22,251 --> 01:20:23,765
The king thinks we are weak.

1064
01:20:23,931 --> 01:20:25,285
His defenses are down.

1065
01:20:25,411 --> 01:20:27,448
We are weak.

1066
01:20:27,571 --> 01:20:29,210
Not if I get Samson to agree.

1067
01:20:29,331 --> 01:20:32,085
This is madness, and it will
end in our slaughter.

1068
01:20:32,211 --> 01:20:34,646
When did we stop
believing in our God?

1069
01:20:34,771 --> 01:20:38,208
This land was promised to us,
and we shall fight for it.

1070
01:20:38,331 --> 01:20:39,765
Either join us

1071
01:20:39,891 --> 01:20:42,486
or stay free of our course.

1072
01:20:51,091 --> 01:20:53,890
You leave again so
soon after weeks away?

1073
01:20:54,011 --> 01:20:56,287
Please don't tell me
it's another Philistine.

1074
01:20:56,411 --> 01:20:57,447
None of your concern, brother.

1075
01:20:57,571 --> 01:20:59,563
Have you no regard left
for your sacred vows?

1076
01:20:59,691 --> 01:21:01,967
You just travel
from one bed to another

1077
01:21:02,091 --> 01:21:03,923
while God's people suffer.
You have no understanding

1078
01:21:04,051 --> 01:21:05,929
of what it is you speak.

1079
01:21:06,051 --> 01:21:08,043
This burden is far too great

1080
01:21:08,171 --> 01:21:09,446
for your small shoulders
to bear.

1081
01:21:09,571 --> 01:21:10,891
Curb your judgment of me,
brother.

1082
01:21:11,011 --> 01:21:12,843
I warn you. Let me be.

1083
01:21:12,971 --> 01:21:14,451
Let you be what exactly?

1084
01:21:14,571 --> 01:21:18,645
I tried... I did...
but I failed many times over,

1085
01:21:18,771 --> 01:21:20,888
and I am done with failing.

1086
01:21:21,011 --> 01:21:22,286
God's not done with you.

1087
01:21:22,411 --> 01:21:24,482
The men are finally ready
to fight.

1088
01:21:24,611 --> 01:21:26,762
And all we need from you,
brother, is to lead us.

1089
01:21:26,891 --> 01:21:30,680
I will not lead them,
you or anyone

1090
01:21:30,811 --> 01:21:32,245
to certain death.

1091
01:21:48,971 --> 01:21:50,405
You came back.

1092
01:21:50,531 --> 01:21:52,409
I had to see you again.

1093
01:21:52,531 --> 01:21:54,807
Please come in.

1094
01:22:08,211 --> 01:22:09,964
I wonder if this
is what peace feels like.

1095
01:22:10,091 --> 01:22:12,651
Ah, peace was a dream
I can no longer feel.

1096
01:22:12,771 --> 01:22:14,603
Then tell me, what do you feel?

1097
01:22:14,731 --> 01:22:15,926
Sorrow.

1098
01:22:16,051 --> 01:22:17,451
Loss.

1099
01:22:17,571 --> 01:22:20,131
I have known
my share of the same.

1100
01:22:21,971 --> 01:22:24,406
What if we were to leave
all this behind?

1101
01:22:24,531 --> 01:22:27,888
Begin again
with no expectations?

1102
01:22:28,011 --> 01:22:29,843
Where would you go?

1103
01:22:29,971 --> 01:22:31,610
Goshen.

1104
01:22:31,731 --> 01:22:33,051
Egypt.

1105
01:22:33,171 --> 01:22:35,288
See the cities of Joseph.

1106
01:22:35,411 --> 01:22:38,370
Kush, maybe, where they have
creatures tall as trees.

1107
01:22:38,491 --> 01:22:40,528
But you would never
leave your people.

1108
01:22:40,691 --> 01:22:43,809
I would have to force you
or bind you.

1109
01:22:45,251 --> 01:22:47,686
As if anything
could ever bind you.

1110
01:22:49,291 --> 01:22:51,601
What if there was something
that could bind me?

1111
01:22:51,731 --> 01:22:53,211
Tell me...

1112
01:22:53,371 --> 01:22:56,250
and I will take you
to all those places tomorrow.

1113
01:22:56,371 --> 01:22:57,691
This would please you?

1114
01:22:57,811 --> 01:22:59,768
To bind me and make me
like any other man?

1115
01:22:59,891 --> 01:23:03,885
You could never be like
any other man, bound or not.

1116
01:23:04,051 --> 01:23:06,361
Then tie me up with fresh ropes,

1117
01:23:06,491 --> 01:23:07,811
ones that have never been used,

1118
01:23:07,971 --> 01:23:10,645
and I will be
like any other man.

1119
01:23:10,771 --> 01:23:15,846
And you can take me
wherever you wish.

1120
01:23:23,251 --> 01:23:24,685
<i>What good has come</i>

1121
01:23:24,811 --> 01:23:26,404
<i>from your time with Samson?</i>

1122
01:23:27,691 --> 01:23:30,570
His loyalty seems
to be his only weakness.

1123
01:23:30,691 --> 01:23:32,284
If it is a weakness.

1124
01:23:32,451 --> 01:23:36,525
Do I need to remind you
who this man is, Delilah?

1125
01:23:36,651 --> 01:23:38,051
He is our enemy.

1126
01:23:38,211 --> 01:23:39,930
He's not out
to destroy us, Rallah.

1127
01:23:40,051 --> 01:23:42,805
Only to protect those
he holds dear.

1128
01:23:42,931 --> 01:23:44,684
Let him be.

1129
01:23:45,851 --> 01:23:47,683
Do you have feelings for him?

1130
01:23:47,811 --> 01:23:50,246
Don't be silly.

1131
01:23:52,211 --> 01:23:56,171
There was once a little sparrow
who stared all day long

1132
01:23:56,291 --> 01:24:00,808
through the bars of her cage,
longing to take flight.

1133
01:24:00,931 --> 01:24:05,164
When the chance arose,
she left her shelter.

1134
01:24:05,291 --> 01:24:07,601
But before she could
reach the sky,

1135
01:24:07,731 --> 01:24:10,485
a hawk descended upon her

1136
01:24:10,611 --> 01:24:13,729
and tore her apart,

1137
01:24:13,851 --> 01:24:17,401
piece by piece.

1138
01:24:18,651 --> 01:24:20,927
Let us finish what we started.

1139
01:24:27,331 --> 01:24:28,845
<i>Are you certain</i>

1140
01:24:29,011 --> 01:24:30,764
<i>that the Hebrews intend
to attack the crown?</i>

1141
01:24:30,891 --> 01:24:32,644
Yes, my king.

1142
01:24:32,771 --> 01:24:34,649
We swear on our lives.

1143
01:24:34,771 --> 01:24:38,924
A group of men have been
hiding weapons in my village.

1144
01:24:39,051 --> 01:24:42,044
This will be
a significant attack, my king.

1145
01:24:42,171 --> 01:24:46,085
We appreciate your protection
and good graces.

1146
01:24:46,211 --> 01:24:48,248
And you may continue to...

1147
01:25:07,451 --> 01:25:09,329
What is wrong?

1148
01:25:09,451 --> 01:25:10,885
Delilah?

1149
01:25:13,011 --> 01:25:15,321
Why do you keep things from me?

1150
01:25:15,451 --> 01:25:16,680
Keep things from you?

1151
01:25:16,851 --> 01:25:18,524
Yes.

1152
01:25:18,651 --> 01:25:20,085
You say you love me,

1153
01:25:20,211 --> 01:25:23,204
but you refuse to share
your innermost secrets.

1154
01:25:23,331 --> 01:25:24,731
What secrets?

1155
01:25:26,451 --> 01:25:28,761
Who is this God
who gives you such strength?

1156
01:25:28,891 --> 01:25:32,089
Why does he allow your people
to suffer so?

1157
01:25:32,211 --> 01:25:34,931
Is he a cruel God, or are you
just a foolish people?

1158
01:25:35,051 --> 01:25:36,804
Delilah.
If we are to be together,

1159
01:25:36,931 --> 01:25:38,570
I should trust you,
but how can I trust you

1160
01:25:38,691 --> 01:25:39,727
when you have lied to me?

1161
01:25:39,851 --> 01:25:41,570
How have I lied?

1162
01:25:41,691 --> 01:25:43,808
You deceived me
about the fresh ropes.

1163
01:25:43,931 --> 01:25:46,526
I was playing along, remember?

1164
01:25:46,651 --> 01:25:49,450
Were there secrets with Taren?

1165
01:25:51,651 --> 01:25:54,450
But there are to be
secrets between us?

1166
01:25:57,771 --> 01:25:59,728
I'm a Nazirite.

1167
01:25:59,891 --> 01:26:01,644
What does that mean?

1168
01:26:02,971 --> 01:26:05,167
Three vows
were bestowed upon me.

1169
01:26:05,291 --> 01:26:09,490
No wine, no touching the dead,
no cutting of my hair.

1170
01:26:11,211 --> 01:26:15,285
I've broken two of them.
If I were to cut my hair...

1171
01:26:15,451 --> 01:26:18,444
I fear my strength
would leave me.

1172
01:26:20,571 --> 01:26:22,369
Your hair?

1173
01:26:26,011 --> 01:26:27,604
Yes.

1174
01:26:27,731 --> 01:26:31,441
Now there are no secrets.

1175
01:26:44,411 --> 01:26:47,370
This is for Samson,
from the crown.

1176
01:26:47,491 --> 01:26:48,766
Hyah!

1177
01:26:56,251 --> 01:26:57,367
You seem quiet.

1178
01:26:58,651 --> 01:27:00,404
What is the matter?

1179
01:27:00,531 --> 01:27:02,409
Nothing, my love.

1180
01:27:06,451 --> 01:27:07,965
Thank you.

1181
01:27:15,091 --> 01:27:16,286
Enough.

1182
01:27:16,411 --> 01:27:18,528
I love you. You know that.

1183
01:27:39,691 --> 01:27:41,523
And I you.

1184
01:28:16,331 --> 01:28:18,084
Samson, the Philistines
are upon you.

1185
01:28:19,611 --> 01:28:20,761
Samson! No!

1186
01:28:23,451 --> 01:28:24,407
No!
My hand!

1187
01:28:24,531 --> 01:28:25,885
Please do not hurt him!

1188
01:28:26,011 --> 01:28:27,570
Please!

1189
01:28:27,691 --> 01:28:28,841
Samson!

1190
01:28:28,971 --> 01:28:30,883
Samson!

1191
01:28:41,331 --> 01:28:43,687
Samson's little brother.

1192
01:28:43,811 --> 01:28:45,245
I'm going to let you watch.

1193
01:28:49,171 --> 01:28:50,764
No.

1194
01:28:50,891 --> 01:28:52,086
Brother! Brother!

1195
01:28:54,451 --> 01:28:57,285
Brother!

1196
01:28:57,411 --> 01:28:58,288
Rallah.

1197
01:29:09,051 --> 01:29:11,964
You were a man to be feared,
Samson.

1198
01:29:12,091 --> 01:29:14,083
Look at you now.

1199
01:29:14,251 --> 01:29:18,803
I will prove to your God
I am worthy of His power.

1200
01:29:18,931 --> 01:29:24,006
I will take your place
in His favor.

1201
01:29:25,771 --> 01:29:27,842
Rallah, you promised!

1202
01:29:27,971 --> 01:29:30,884
No. No.

1203
01:29:31,011 --> 01:29:32,730
Rallah. Rallah!

1204
01:29:32,851 --> 01:29:34,126
No!
Rallah!

1205
01:29:34,251 --> 01:29:36,049
No! Rallah!
Rallah... No!

1206
01:29:46,171 --> 01:29:47,730
Samson!

1207
01:30:24,531 --> 01:30:25,806
Caleb.

1208
01:30:26,931 --> 01:30:28,126
Forgive me.

1209
01:30:28,251 --> 01:30:31,847
Once again, I have failed.

1210
01:30:33,571 --> 01:30:35,927
I did what was right
in my own eyes.

1211
01:30:36,051 --> 01:30:38,805
I deserve this.

1212
01:30:38,931 --> 01:30:41,890
Brother, but you do not.

1213
01:31:07,291 --> 01:31:09,647
<i>Samson, Samson, Samson.</i>

1214
01:31:09,771 --> 01:31:11,524
The greatest warrior ever known,

1215
01:31:11,651 --> 01:31:14,883
yet look at you now.

1216
01:31:15,011 --> 01:31:17,367
What a waste.

1217
01:31:17,491 --> 01:31:18,925
Do what you came here for.

1218
01:31:19,051 --> 01:31:21,930
I'm not here to kill you,
Samson.

1219
01:31:22,091 --> 01:31:25,209
I'm here to free you
and your brother.

1220
01:31:25,331 --> 01:31:31,089
All you must do is tell me
how I may receive your power.

1221
01:31:38,171 --> 01:31:40,288
Stand him up.

1222
01:31:43,371 --> 01:31:45,010
Your secret.

1223
01:31:46,091 --> 01:31:47,764
Tell me.

1224
01:31:47,891 --> 01:31:49,484
There is no secret.

1225
01:31:49,611 --> 01:31:51,762
My power is from God.

1226
01:31:51,891 --> 01:31:54,565
Then petition your God for me.

1227
01:31:54,691 --> 01:31:56,842
Tell Him that I conquered you,

1228
01:31:56,971 --> 01:32:01,966
that I am more worthy,
that I deserve His strength.

1229
01:32:06,331 --> 01:32:07,606
Tell Him!

1230
01:32:07,731 --> 01:32:09,450
Or I will rend your flesh

1231
01:32:09,571 --> 01:32:12,291
and feed you to the rats!

1232
01:32:12,411 --> 01:32:14,687
A just punishment for my sins.

1233
01:32:14,851 --> 01:32:16,843
Do what you will.

1234
01:32:19,971 --> 01:32:21,849
Tell me!

1235
01:32:23,331 --> 01:32:24,287
Tell me!

1236
01:32:25,691 --> 01:32:28,206
I will have the truth!

1237
01:32:28,331 --> 01:32:29,765
Now!

1238
01:32:29,891 --> 01:32:31,644
Please!

1239
01:32:31,771 --> 01:32:32,727
Stop!

1240
01:32:32,851 --> 01:32:34,251
I'll tell you.

1241
01:32:44,011 --> 01:32:46,128
Tell me what I must do.

1242
01:32:47,971 --> 01:32:50,406
Fear the Living God.

1243
01:32:50,531 --> 01:32:53,000
Humble yourself.

1244
01:32:53,131 --> 01:32:55,088
Or He will humble you.

1245
01:33:05,251 --> 01:33:06,401
<i>Why?</i>

1246
01:33:06,531 --> 01:33:08,250
Why have you not
brought me his head?

1247
01:33:08,371 --> 01:33:09,771
Samson is my trophy.

1248
01:33:09,891 --> 01:33:12,725
You have captured
a beloved leader.

1249
01:33:12,851 --> 01:33:15,650
You must kill him
before they come for him!

1250
01:33:15,771 --> 01:33:16,841
That would be a waste.

1251
01:33:16,971 --> 01:33:18,166
Waste?

1252
01:33:18,331 --> 01:33:20,163
Word of Samson's power

1253
01:33:20,331 --> 01:33:22,448
has spread
from Persia to Thebes.

1254
01:33:22,571 --> 01:33:26,008
And now they will know
that we have conquered him.

1255
01:33:26,171 --> 01:33:29,243
"Conquered him"?
I will use him to show his people

1256
01:33:29,371 --> 01:33:30,600
and anyone who challenges us

1257
01:33:30,731 --> 01:33:34,441
that we are greater
than their gods.

1258
01:33:34,571 --> 01:33:36,881
I will be feared everywhere.

1259
01:33:37,011 --> 01:33:40,448
I fear you...
Year... year after year,

1260
01:33:40,571 --> 01:33:43,882
we will celebrate his
humiliation and the triumph.

1261
01:33:44,011 --> 01:33:47,527
My triumph over his God.
Triumph? Your triumph?

1262
01:33:48,651 --> 01:33:50,131
You imbecile!

1263
01:33:50,251 --> 01:33:52,243
You've learned nothing.

1264
01:33:52,371 --> 01:33:54,090
You know nothing.

1265
01:34:00,371 --> 01:34:02,488
Father...

1266
01:34:02,611 --> 01:34:05,968
you no longer rule over me

1267
01:34:06,091 --> 01:34:09,528
or this kingdom.

1268
01:34:09,651 --> 01:34:13,008
I may not have your wisdom,
your experience

1269
01:34:13,131 --> 01:34:17,205
or even your love,
but I have your crown!

1270
01:34:17,331 --> 01:34:21,883
And this is a glory
I wish not to share with you.

1271
01:34:30,611 --> 01:34:32,648
My son the king.

1272
01:34:41,571 --> 01:34:44,245
You have a visitor, Hebrews.

1273
01:35:00,731 --> 01:35:02,484
It is me, my love.

1274
01:35:02,611 --> 01:35:05,285
I'm here to pay
for your release.

1275
01:35:05,411 --> 01:35:08,688
Paid with the silver
that put me here.

1276
01:35:11,131 --> 01:35:13,600
Rallah misled me.

1277
01:35:13,731 --> 01:35:16,405
I believed I could free you,
but I was wrong.

1278
01:35:16,571 --> 01:35:19,609
I will give back every piece
of silver for your release.

1279
01:35:21,011 --> 01:35:23,367
Show your love for me now.

1280
01:35:25,171 --> 01:35:27,128
Free Caleb instead of me.

1281
01:35:27,291 --> 01:35:28,884
I cannot leave you here.

1282
01:35:29,011 --> 01:35:30,240
Free him.

1283
01:35:32,451 --> 01:35:34,408
And you can have my forgiveness.

1284
01:35:50,091 --> 01:35:52,367
I will always love you.

1285
01:35:54,211 --> 01:35:55,327
Delilah.

1286
01:36:07,171 --> 01:36:08,730
You were right, Caleb.

1287
01:36:08,851 --> 01:36:10,922
We should fight.

1288
01:36:11,051 --> 01:36:13,008
Gather the men.

1289
01:36:13,171 --> 01:36:15,527
Prepare to take the city.

1290
01:36:15,651 --> 01:36:18,041
But how can I without you?

1291
01:36:18,171 --> 01:36:21,005
With the power
God has placed within you.

1292
01:36:21,131 --> 01:36:23,851
He has not abandoned me, Caleb,
because I am in these chains.

1293
01:36:23,971 --> 01:36:27,362
Even inside these walls,
I hear His call.

1294
01:36:28,571 --> 01:36:31,040
And maybe for the first time,

1295
01:36:31,171 --> 01:36:34,005
I am hearing His desires
and not my own.

1296
01:36:37,131 --> 01:36:38,804
I love you, brother.

1297
01:36:52,011 --> 01:36:55,322
My strength
is now Your strength.

1298
01:36:55,451 --> 01:36:57,886
My eyes Yours.

1299
01:36:59,771 --> 01:37:03,367
You have called me from birth,
and now I listen.

1300
01:37:06,371 --> 01:37:08,931
What would You have me do?

1301
01:37:42,731 --> 01:37:45,326
<i>I am your mighty king</i>

1302
01:37:45,451 --> 01:37:48,011
<i>who, with the power of Dagon,</i>

1303
01:37:48,131 --> 01:37:51,010
have subjugated
even the strongest man.

1304
01:37:51,131 --> 01:37:54,169
Are you ready
for our special guest?

1305
01:37:57,531 --> 01:37:59,488
Bring the prisoner.

1306
01:38:19,371 --> 01:38:20,487
Get him!

1307
01:38:26,291 --> 01:38:27,805
Boo!

1308
01:38:31,651 --> 01:38:33,085
Kill the Hebrew!

1309
01:38:33,211 --> 01:38:34,850
Kill the prisoner!

1310
01:38:49,011 --> 01:38:51,003
Kill him!

1311
01:38:59,291 --> 01:39:04,241
Dagon's arm is mighty
and his vengeance swift.

1312
01:39:04,371 --> 01:39:06,522
Praise be to Dagon.

1313
01:39:06,651 --> 01:39:09,371
Praise be to Dagon!
Praise be to Dagon!

1314
01:39:50,611 --> 01:39:52,489
Kill him! String him up! Come on!
Kill the Hebrew!

1315
01:39:58,531 --> 01:40:02,411
Kill him! Kill him!

1316
01:40:02,531 --> 01:40:05,171
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

1317
01:40:05,291 --> 01:40:07,522
Kill him! Kill him!

1318
01:40:07,651 --> 01:40:11,008
Kill him! Kill him!
Kill him! Kill him!

1319
01:40:11,131 --> 01:40:13,600
Kill him! Kill him!

1320
01:40:13,731 --> 01:40:15,962
Lord...

1321
01:40:16,091 --> 01:40:19,687
give me Your strength
one last time.

1322
01:40:19,811 --> 01:40:23,487
Let me die with the Philistines.

1323
01:40:30,451 --> 01:40:32,010
No.

1324
01:41:06,451 --> 01:41:07,521
Kill the prisoner.

1325
01:41:07,651 --> 01:41:09,847
Kill him!

1326
01:41:10,011 --> 01:41:11,411
Kill him!

1327
01:41:23,091 --> 01:41:23,968
No.

1328
01:41:33,571 --> 01:41:34,766
Kill him!

1329
01:41:45,811 --> 01:41:48,531
Move! Get out of the way!

1330
01:42:37,451 --> 01:42:39,408
<i>On that day,</i>

1331
01:42:39,531 --> 01:42:42,888
<i>my brother heard God's call.</i>

1332
01:42:43,011 --> 01:42:47,563
<i>He fulfilled the promise that
was given before his birth.</i>

1333
01:42:47,731 --> 01:42:50,121
<i>To our people,
it was a day for joy.</i>

1334
01:42:50,251 --> 01:42:54,006
<i>Free at last from
the Philistine tyrant Rallah.</i>

1335
01:42:55,531 --> 01:42:58,410
<i>But for us who knew Samson</i>

1336
01:42:58,531 --> 01:43:01,763
<i>as a brother and as a son,</i>

1337
01:43:01,891 --> 01:43:05,646
<i>it was a day to mourn
the passing of a good man.</i>

1338
01:43:05,771 --> 01:43:08,923
<i>A man whose heart
was as vast as his strength.</i>

1339
01:43:09,051 --> 01:43:11,088
Brothers! Hebrews!

1340
01:43:11,211 --> 01:43:12,725
Today, we fight!

1341
01:43:12,851 --> 01:43:15,889
God is with us!

1342
01:43:16,051 --> 01:43:17,280
God is with us!

1343

Samson! Samson! Samson! Samson!

1344
01:43:20,851 --> 01:43:24,891
Samson! Samson! Samson!
Samson! Samson!

1345
01:43:25,011 --> 01:43:26,650
<i>Many battles were yet</i>

1346
01:43:26,811 --> 01:43:29,087
<i>to be fought
over the Promised Land.</i>

1347
01:43:29,211 --> 01:43:31,931
<i>The Philistines
sent their armies,</i>

1348
01:43:32,051 --> 01:43:34,885
<i>but the tribes of Israel
had awakened.</i>

1349
01:43:35,011 --> 01:43:37,970
<i>We'd seen miracles done,
and we knew then</i>

1350
01:43:38,091 --> 01:43:40,890
<i>that no force
could stand against us,</i>

1351
01:43:41,011 --> 01:43:44,641
<i>for the strength and the faith
of Samson was within us all.</i>

1352
01:43:46,491 --> 01:43:50,963
<i>God gave us Samson
to begin our deliverance,</i>

1353
01:43:51,131 --> 01:43:54,442
<i>but who would he send
to finish it?</i>

1354
01:43:54,571 --> 01:43:58,565
<i>Generation later, a small
shepherd boy named David</i>

1355
01:43:58,691 --> 01:44:00,569
<i>stepped onto the battlefield</i>

1356
01:44:00,691 --> 01:44:04,685
<i>and challenged an undefeatable
Philistine giant.</i>

1357
01:44:04,851 --> 01:44:07,002
