<i>My rise to the top of the Haden High School food chain,
happened faster than a three-second snapchat.</i>

2
00:00:09,361 --> 00:00:11,016
<i>But it wasn't always that way.</i>

3
00:00:11,584 --> 00:00:13,820
<i>A few weeks ago, I was just like you.</i>

4
00:00:14,404 --> 00:00:18,164
<i>Then I updated my status, and some
pretty strange things began to happen.</i>

5
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,638
<i>I feel like I owe everyone an explanation,
so here it is.</i>

6
00:00:22,526 --> 00:00:25,159
<i>Oh, and by the way, I don't play hockey.</i>

7
00:00:25,857 --> 00:00:30,045
Line by line resync and more
by Dandysubs on 20180421.

8
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:37,009
<i>Or at least I didn't, until a few weeks ago.</i>

9
00:00:38,575 --> 00:00:40,253
Oh, come on, kid.

10
00:00:40,986 --> 00:00:43,617
Knock-knock,
I'm invading your privacy.

11
00:00:43,642 --> 00:00:44,855
Come on, get up!

12
00:00:44,895 --> 00:00:47,411
You're gonna be late
for your first day of school.

13
00:00:47,663 --> 00:00:50,870
- Ugh, it smells like a wet dog in here.
- <i>See that guy?</i>

14
00:00:50,987 --> 00:00:52,854
- Hey!
- <i>That was me not so long ago.</i>

15
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,326
Listen, you need to finish
putting this room together,

16
00:00:55,332 --> 00:00:59,354
so when you get home from school today
I want you to start unpacking, all right?

17
00:01:00,305 --> 00:01:01,374
Breakfast in ten.

18
00:01:01,465 --> 00:01:04,670
Wait, wait, Mom, Mom!
I don't think I feel so good.

19
00:01:04,846 --> 00:01:05,999
Yeah, right.

20
00:01:17,127 --> 00:01:19,061
- <i>Hey, bud, how you doing?</i>
- Hey dad.

21
00:01:19,067 --> 00:01:21,037
Sorry for hittin' you up so early.
Did I wake you?

22
00:01:21,043 --> 00:01:23,442
<i>Aw, please, don't worry about it,
I had to get up early...</i>

23
00:01:23,448 --> 00:01:25,637
<i>giant swells this morning,
everything okay?</i>

24
00:01:25,643 --> 00:01:26,808
This place sucks.

25
00:01:27,426 --> 00:01:29,372
- I wish I could be there with you.
- <i>Listen</i>...

26
00:01:29,378 --> 00:01:31,231
<i>you just gotta hang
tough until summer, okay...</i>

27
00:01:31,241 --> 00:01:33,838
<i>then you're gonna be right
back here in Cali with me.</i>

28
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:34,938
I love you, Pop.

29
00:01:34,944 --> 00:01:37,042
<i>I love you too man.
Hang in there, all right?</i>

30
00:01:41,524 --> 00:01:42,619
Whoa!

31
00:01:43,063 --> 00:01:44,886
- Oh, well...
- Sorry about that.

32
00:01:44,892 --> 00:01:48,346
- Still getting used to having people in the house.
- Yeah, yeah, I'll come back later.

33
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:53,819
Maxi, don't play on your
phone at the table.

34
00:01:53,825 --> 00:01:55,753
I'm not playing, I'm swiping.

35
00:01:56,086 --> 00:01:57,431
- Swiping?
- Yes.

36
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,730
Get that app off your phone, young lady.

37
00:01:59,955 --> 00:02:01,492
Put it on my phone, though.

38
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:04,949
Dude, you're gonna wear that
on the first day of school?

39
00:02:04,955 --> 00:02:06,696
This isn't Huntington Beach.

40
00:02:06,778 --> 00:02:08,762
Okay, eat up.
The bus will be here in ten minutes.

41
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,712
I don't know why
I couldn't bring my car.

42
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:12,242
Dad said he'd pay
to have it shipped.

43
00:02:12,293 --> 00:02:14,950
Well, I love that money is
no object for your father,

44
00:02:14,956 --> 00:02:16,443
'cause he doesn't make any.

45
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:20,193
Your dad's need to relax has gotten in the
way of him finding any kind of work.

46
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:22,068
I get it, you guys are mad at me.

47
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,849
But just bear with me, just trust me. I have a plan.
This is better for all of us, all right?

48
00:02:32,107 --> 00:02:36,107
Hey, bro! You need to
drop the teen angst act.

49
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,347
Mom and Dad are over.
This is the new normal. Accept it.

50
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:42,444
Look, they're only separated.
They're not getting a divorce.

51
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:45,504
She moved 3.000 miles
to get away from him.

52
00:02:45,688 --> 00:02:49,315
To me, that screams divorce,
but then again, I'm a realist.

53
00:02:51,653 --> 00:02:55,143

00:03:11,154 --> 00:03:13,370
23? Room 23?

56
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,745
Does anybody know
where Room 23 is?

57
00:03:16,372 --> 00:03:18,472
Sorry, man, my bad.

58
00:03:19,771 --> 00:03:21,570
Hey, do you guys know
where Room 23 is?

59
00:03:21,608 --> 00:03:22,774
Cool skateboard.

60
00:03:23,145 --> 00:03:24,395
- Thanks.
- 23?

61
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:25,986
- Yeah.
- Isn't that East wing, guys?

62
00:03:25,992 --> 00:03:28,955
- Yeah, I got a class there.
- Yeah, it's on the other side of the school.

63
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:30,294
I really appreciate it, dude.

64
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,201
Not a problem... dude.

65
00:03:35,931 --> 00:03:37,589
Come on, come on, where is it?

69
00:03:53,522 --> 00:03:54,754
- Hi.
- Hi.

70
00:03:54,927 --> 00:03:56,142
Sorry, I'm late.

71
00:03:56,162 --> 00:03:57,561
Well, Mr?

72
00:03:58,287 --> 00:03:59,603
Kyle, Moore.

73
00:03:59,768 --> 00:04:03,047
Kyle Moore, I really hope this isn't how
the rest of the year is going to go.

74
00:04:03,127 --> 00:04:03,879
Mm-hm.

75
00:04:03,904 --> 00:04:05,237
Please have a seat, Kyle.

76
00:04:07,951 --> 00:04:11,414
<i>* I saw a sign of violence *</i>

78
00:04:16,955 --> 00:04:18,088
Great.

79
00:04:42,612 --> 00:04:43,516
Hey.

80
00:04:44,395 --> 00:04:45,393
Hi.

81
00:04:47,148 --> 00:04:50,784
I saw you singing earlier.
You were, you were great.

82
00:04:50,997 --> 00:04:53,685
I was a little flat, but, thank you.

83
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,017
I'm Kyle.

84
00:04:55,263 --> 00:04:56,408
I'm Dani.

85
00:04:59,772 --> 00:05:02,129
Are you trying to make me jealous?

86
00:05:02,876 --> 00:05:04,831
Brian, this is Kyle.

87
00:05:05,017 --> 00:05:07,305
Kyle, this is Brian Massey.

88
00:05:09,777 --> 00:05:10,668
Hey, man?

89
00:05:10,762 --> 00:05:13,224
Are you making a play
on my girl, Spray Tan?

90
00:05:13,281 --> 00:05:15,925
Brian, I'm not your girl, okay?
You're gay.

91
00:05:16,573 --> 00:05:19,041
37% percent technically ain't gay, baby.

92
00:05:19,093 --> 00:05:20,598
And you were flat again today.

93
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:22,100
Do you wanna win the Slam, or not?

94
00:05:22,106 --> 00:05:23,846
Yes, yes, of course,
I want to win the Slam.

95
00:05:23,852 --> 00:05:27,190
Well, then, mediocrity isn't gonna cut it.
Okay, I'm not taking my shirt off.

96
00:05:27,196 --> 00:05:29,356
I can not lose that
much water weight again.

97
00:05:29,401 --> 00:05:30,733
You need to step it up.

98
00:05:31,096 --> 00:05:32,998
Are you wearing women's jeans?

99
00:05:34,405 --> 00:05:35,471
No.

100
00:05:38,194 --> 00:05:40,135
Yes... my stylist picked them out.

101
00:05:40,275 --> 00:05:41,559
Dude, you don't have a stylist.

102
00:05:41,565 --> 00:05:44,432
Okay, H & M had a flash sale,
I blacked out.

103
00:05:45,747 --> 00:05:46,712
Later, Kyle.

104
00:05:50,486 --> 00:05:53,784
Don't even think about it.
You can think about this.

105
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:12,658
Hey, Kyle,
looks like you're acclimating nicely.

106
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,282
This is my boyfriend, Xing-Fu.

107
00:06:15,414 --> 00:06:18,433
Xing, Mr. Unpopular here is my brother, Kyle.

108
00:06:20,144 --> 00:06:21,339
Where are you from in China?

109
00:06:21,345 --> 00:06:23,740
Oh, no, he's from Connecticut.
His real name's Donald.

110
00:06:23,746 --> 00:06:26,312
But he only speaks Mandarin,
because he's so in tune,

111
00:06:26,318 --> 00:06:28,812
with his Chinese roots.
Let's go, Fu.

112
00:06:34,691 --> 00:06:36,344
What are you doing at my table?

113
00:06:37,247 --> 00:06:38,615
Sorry, I didn't know it was yours.

114
00:06:38,621 --> 00:06:41,258
Well, it is, so beat it.

115
00:06:43,353 --> 00:06:47,539
Wait, wait, no, no, no, no, kidding, I'm kidding.
You thought I was serious?

116
00:06:47,727 --> 00:06:51,716
That was awesome. No, I'm not, I'm not a fighter.
I know I look intimidating but,

117
00:06:51,722 --> 00:06:56,290
no, I've never been in a fight. Well, that's not true.
When I was in third grade this girl kicked me,

118
00:06:56,296 --> 00:06:58,421
in... the eggplant emoji...

119
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:03,407
and I just fell down and cried,
and pee'd a little.

120
00:07:03,628 --> 00:07:06,467
Thanks for sharing that with me.
Yeah. Are you really from California?

121
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:07,997
Yeah, I really am.

122
00:07:08,007 --> 00:07:11,499
That is gnarly. Is that how
you say gnarly?

123
00:07:11,548 --> 00:07:13,495
- Sure.
- I've always wanted to go to California,

124
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:15,814
like just skateboard, you know,
like down the Venice boardwalk

125
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,665
and like hang out with Snoop Dogg, you know,
Straight Outta Compton-style,

126
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:21,698
except without, you know,
the smokies, because I have asthma.

127
00:07:21,704 --> 00:07:24,751
But anyways, I can't go, because I sunburn
easily and I'm not really athletic.

128
00:07:24,757 --> 00:07:28,414
I'm talking a lot, sorry,
my name's Lonnie. Oh, fist bump.

129
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,559
Sorry bro.

130
00:07:29,565 --> 00:07:31,431
- But everyone calls me Grimace.
- Why Grimace?

131
00:07:31,571 --> 00:07:33,652
Oh, because everyone
thinks I look like him.

132
00:07:33,658 --> 00:07:37,591
I don't see it, dude.
Dude, I sound like a Californian.

133
00:07:37,597 --> 00:07:38,663
Yo, Grimace?

134
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,580
Hey, Derek.

135
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,219
I got a B-plus on my history paper.

136
00:07:43,225 --> 00:07:44,545
Yeah, that's not good.

137
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:48,118
That's unacceptable.
Stop eating, start studying.

138
00:07:50,668 --> 00:07:51,887
Got it, dude.

139
00:07:52,985 --> 00:07:54,540
You do that guy's homework?

140
00:07:54,622 --> 00:07:57,956
Yeah, Principal Kim makes me "tutor" him.

141
00:07:58,029 --> 00:07:59,999
He's the best hockey player in Connecticut.

142
00:08:00,005 --> 00:08:03,725
<i>He scored more goals in two periods,
than any other high schooler in history.</i>

143
00:08:03,731 --> 00:08:06,873
<i>He's got a Youtube channel,
and I hear the pros are watching him.</i>

144
00:08:06,955 --> 00:08:11,084
<i>And then there's Charlotte, Derek's girlfriend,
hottest girl in the whole school.</i>

145
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:15,658
<i>The queen of Twitter, Snapchat, Facebook.
She's got like half a million followers on Instagram.</i>

146
00:08:15,664 --> 00:08:17,864
<i>Queen of all the hockey groupies.</i>

147
00:08:17,987 --> 00:08:20,134
They're expected to win the
state championship.

148
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,981
We haven't won in like 20 years,
so it's all because of that guy.

149
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:25,092
Yeah, well, I'm not a hockey fan.

150
00:08:25,098 --> 00:08:26,874
Me, neither, but figure skating's cool.

151
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,467
I mean, whatever.

152
00:08:28,473 --> 00:08:30,055
- Yo, Grimace!
- What?

153
00:08:33,386 --> 00:08:35,835
Chocolate money shot!

154
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:39,557
You got your milk all over my titties.

155
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,179
Did I forget to mention he has
a really accurate slap shot?

156
00:08:42,185 --> 00:08:45,238
He's good. Do I have anything in my face?

157
00:08:45,827 --> 00:08:49,216
Oh, you got a little something right... here.

158
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,829
Yo, Point Break!

159
00:09:03,056 --> 00:09:06,757
Hey. Come on, man.
I'm just messing with you. All right?

160
00:09:06,774 --> 00:09:07,661
It's nothing personal.

161
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:10,687
We just do it to all the new kids.
So, uh, we cool?

162
00:09:13,498 --> 00:09:14,934
Kyle! Look out!

163
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,207
Oh!

164
00:09:16,213 --> 00:09:18,153
Five minutes for cross checking!

165
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:20,623
How's that locker feel, Point Break?

166
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,352
Oh... Cali!

167
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,540
Hey, come on, give me my phone back.

168
00:09:25,546 --> 00:09:27,480
Oh, you wanna call your mommy, Point Break?

169
00:09:27,545 --> 00:09:28,988
Oh, you can actually use my phone.

170
00:09:29,781 --> 00:09:30,614
Give it back.

171
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:32,289
Too slow.

172
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,406
They didn't teach you any hockey in Cali?

173
00:09:36,328 --> 00:09:37,869
Come on, Cali Boy!

174
00:09:41,434 --> 00:09:42,435
Give me my phone back.

175
00:09:42,441 --> 00:09:45,205
Whoa, they teach you manners in California?

176
00:09:45,598 --> 00:09:47,237
All you gotta do is say please.

177
00:09:54,686 --> 00:09:55,564
Please?

178
00:09:55,765 --> 00:09:58,499
That wasn't so hard, was it?
Here, take it back.

179
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:03,720
Nice phone,
you might want to get that looked at... pussy.

180
00:10:05,694 --> 00:10:07,969
Mortal enemy, check.

181
00:10:27,933 --> 00:10:29,557
Hey, man, do you fix phones?

182
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:34,069
Mm...

183
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:40,571
You're tryin' to lock me into a lot of do's and
don't's right now, you beautiful angel.

184
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:44,467
Let me tell you something,
in a former life, I was a wolf.

185
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:47,141
Hm, cool.

186
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:51,792
Mm...

187
00:10:52,131 --> 00:10:55,782
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Your chi is way off.

188
00:10:55,812 --> 00:10:57,281
Your chakras are not aligned.

189
00:10:57,303 --> 00:11:00,679
You know what I'm saying?
The feng is not shui-ing.

190
00:11:01,648 --> 00:11:04,123
Uh-huh. Can you fix my phone or not?

191
00:11:04,596 --> 00:11:06,342
Yeah, I can fix your phone.
Let me see it.

192
00:11:06,348 --> 00:11:07,370
Okay.

193
00:11:08,265 --> 00:11:11,278
Yeah... say goodnight, this thing's done.

194
00:11:11,388 --> 00:11:13,918
You've insta-ed your last gram,
tweeted your last twit.

195
00:11:13,982 --> 00:11:17,183
I know, you left your whole life behind,
and you're pissed.

196
00:11:17,317 --> 00:11:20,254
And the kids around here,
in pistachio khakis?

197
00:11:20,819 --> 00:11:23,685
<i>They don't really comprendo
a surfer dude like you.</i>

198
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,085
Am I right? Or am I right?

199
00:11:27,971 --> 00:11:29,304
How did you know that?

200
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:33,013
Because I'm here to enlighten the load, baby.

201
00:11:33,176 --> 00:11:35,114
Mmmmm.

202
00:11:35,282 --> 00:11:39,160
Listen, why don't you, tell me,
what I can do...

203
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:43,310
to make your life...
a little more namaste.

204
00:11:46,063 --> 00:11:49,839
I don't know. I just~
I want things to be different.

205
00:11:58,395 --> 00:12:01,465
Let's fly. Do it with me.

206
00:12:02,316 --> 00:12:03,719
I'm not gonna do that.

207
00:12:03,752 --> 00:12:05,318
Then nothing's gonna change.

208
00:12:05,721 --> 00:12:09,927
Don't be scared. Come on, yeah,
yeah, there you go, fly.

209
00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:12,565
Close your eyes.
Do you know what's below you?

210
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,930
All the haters, and they're
pointing and they're saying,

211
00:12:14,936 --> 00:12:18,389
"Look at that beautiful, blonde bird
with well-conditioned hair."

212
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:19,773
You know what I'm saying?

213
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,810
That was intense, man.
How do you feel?

214
00:12:25,143 --> 00:12:26,984
- Embarrassed.
- Great, me, too.

215
00:12:27,011 --> 00:12:29,310
I want to show you something.
Take a look at this.

216
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:32,218
It's my own social media app.
It's called YOUniverse.

217
00:12:32,229 --> 00:12:35,230
When you look at this screen man,
what do you see?

218
00:12:35,859 --> 00:12:36,834
A blank page?

219
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,222
You're cute, but you are so stupid.
This is you, dude.

220
00:12:40,369 --> 00:12:43,124
Not the "you" you are,
the "you" you want to be.

221
00:12:43,414 --> 00:12:44,692
You can be anybody.

222
00:12:45,003 --> 00:12:47,815
You just gotta fill this page,
a new beginning,

223
00:12:47,859 --> 00:12:49,134
you know what I'm saying?

224
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,766
Because when you put positive
vibes out in the YOUniverse...

225
00:12:51,782 --> 00:12:53,265
the YOUniverse listens.

226
00:12:53,865 --> 00:12:57,177
Give me your hand.
Give me your beautiful, soft hand.

227
00:12:57,648 --> 00:13:03,218
Take this... and go... to your destiny.

228
00:13:05,133 --> 00:13:06,082
Thanks.

229
00:13:25,585 --> 00:13:28,817
<i>We're all made of energy,
me and you.</i>

230
00:13:29,174 --> 00:13:30,704
You've gotta be kidding me.

231
00:13:33,186 --> 00:13:34,319
Whatever.

232
00:13:45,806 --> 00:13:48,162
All you gotta do is fill the screen, baby.

233
00:13:54,588 --> 00:13:56,982
- Pants up, hands where I can see 'em.
- What do you want?

234
00:13:56,988 --> 00:13:58,945
I need to borrow your balcony.
My window's painted shut,

235
00:13:58,951 --> 00:14:01,012
- and I need to sneak out.
- Where you goin'?

236
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:03,782
Xing-fu's taking me to
an Anime and Chill party.

237
00:14:04,293 --> 00:14:07,017
What are you doing tonight?
That's right, nothing!

238
00:14:07,739 --> 00:14:08,739
See ya'!

239
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,357
Good morning. Just warming up the pipes,
don't mind me.

240
00:15:05,593 --> 00:15:06,927
Good morning, Sunshine.

241
00:15:06,953 --> 00:15:07,951
Good morning.

242
00:15:08,044 --> 00:15:10,284
You might want to take a look outside.

243
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:13,024
Is that my car?

244
00:15:13,032 --> 00:15:14,498
That just showed up on a truck.

245
00:15:14,524 --> 00:15:17,714
Yes! I can't believe it.
That's my car!

246
00:15:17,761 --> 00:15:20,105
Yes, it is, and I can't believe it.

247
00:15:20,158 --> 00:15:23,205
There's no way. Where's Dad?

248
00:15:23,309 --> 00:15:25,220
Probably tanning on a beach somewhere...

249
00:15:25,226 --> 00:15:28,404
and look, you need to get a job,
so you can pay for the gas,

250
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,911
but I will, help you
with the insurance.

251
00:15:30,938 --> 00:15:33,907
Okay. Oh, I knew he'd come through.

252
00:15:34,244 --> 00:15:35,258
Yes!

253
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,362
Yeah, I thought about trying out
for the hockey team,

254
00:15:39,382 --> 00:15:41,753
but, my physician said that
I have the ankle strength,

255
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,231
of a ten-year-old girl.

256
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,719
But you know, multiplayer,
online gaming is my real passion.

257
00:15:45,725 --> 00:15:47,048
It can get pretty physical, too.

258
00:15:47,054 --> 00:15:49,959
Like one time, I passed out
after 17 straight hours of Warcraft.

259
00:15:49,965 --> 00:15:51,516
- Really?
- Yeah, dehydration.

260
00:15:51,531 --> 00:15:53,472
I went to the doctors
and I woke up in the ER.

261
00:15:53,478 --> 00:15:56,597
And then, I met my girlfriend
through League of Legends.

262
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:59,759
She's a bikini model,
her name's Guadalupe.

263
00:15:59,784 --> 00:16:01,463
Hey, Lonnie, can I ask you something?

264
00:16:01,482 --> 00:16:04,012
Have you ever heard of an app
called YOUniverse?

265
00:16:04,106 --> 00:16:07,859
No, and I'm on everything,
Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest.

266
00:16:07,865 --> 00:16:10,452
Sure, I only have like two followers,
it's my mom and my granny,

267
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,638
and my dad blocked me for some reason.

268
00:16:12,644 --> 00:16:14,559
That's weird, why would you
block your own son, right?

269
00:16:14,565 --> 00:16:17,602
I haven't talked to him about that.
Wait, wait, what's YOUniverse?

270
00:16:23,798 --> 00:16:26,341
It's just something I read about.
Gotta go, see ya'!

271
00:16:27,192 --> 00:16:30,953
Cool, nothing, thanks for
starting that conversation.

272
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,776
I'll tell Guadalupe about that.

273
00:16:34,421 --> 00:16:36,487
She's my girlfriend,
Guadalupe is my girl.

274
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,395
No one cares? Are you on Twitter?

275
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,548
* We can find a way to break through *

276
00:16:43,682 --> 00:16:46,163
* Even if we can't find heaven *

277
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:48,507
* I'll walk through hell with you *

278
00:16:48,602 --> 00:16:50,423
* I'm gonna stand by you *

279
00:16:50,525 --> 00:16:53,059
Beth! Beth, thank you very much.

280
00:16:53,085 --> 00:16:56,781
Um, I don't mean,
for you to take this personally...

281
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,359
but that was, and I say this
with the utmost respect,

282
00:17:00,434 --> 00:17:04,222
like listening to two cats humping.
Is that fair?

283
00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:07,290
Thanks, Beth!

284
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,773
Enjoy the stage as you leave it's...

285
00:17:10,016 --> 00:17:12,074
it's the last time you'll ever be on one.

286
00:17:12,506 --> 00:17:13,546
Okay.

287
00:17:32,234 --> 00:17:36,122
All right, off you go everybody
who didn't make it, you can leave.

288
00:17:36,128 --> 00:17:38,319
Grab your~
There, yes, you're one, certainly.

289
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:39,738
Yes, you were terrible.

290
00:17:39,744 --> 00:17:41,983
Okay? Thanks, gang, have a good day.

291
00:17:42,053 --> 00:17:44,907
All right, Dani, Brian, I'm gonna
need you up on stage.

292
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,827
Band and chorus, we got nine
weeks to do this, not a lot of time.

293
00:17:51,601 --> 00:17:54,785
Excuse me... um... sorry.

294
00:17:55,806 --> 00:17:56,936
I'm here to audition.

295
00:17:56,968 --> 00:17:58,324
Okay, and you are?

296
00:17:58,408 --> 00:17:59,647
I'm Kyle Moore.

297
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,600
Are you a singer, Mr. Moore?

298
00:18:01,918 --> 00:18:05,887
Yeah... uh... I'm classically trained.

299
00:18:06,195 --> 00:18:07,685
You're classically trained?

300
00:18:07,818 --> 00:18:08,647
Yep.

301
00:18:08,692 --> 00:18:12,579
Okay, everybody sit down,
we're gonna do one more up here.

302
00:18:13,996 --> 00:18:15,532
You know where the stage is?

303
00:18:16,534 --> 00:18:17,947
- It's this thing.
- Yeah.

304
00:18:18,745 --> 00:18:20,025
Have a go at it.

305
00:18:25,384 --> 00:18:28,132
All right, hey, uh, what will you be singing?

306
00:18:28,347 --> 00:18:29,365
- Singing?
- Yeah.

307
00:18:29,383 --> 00:18:33,917
Uh... it's a surprise, even to me.

308
00:18:34,036 --> 00:18:39,236
I ah, usually just let my inner rock star,
do whatever he's feeling.

309
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:41,018
Your, inner rock star?

310
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:44,965
Yeah... yeah.

311
00:18:46,515 --> 00:18:48,505
<i>We're all just made of molecules, man.</i>

312
00:18:48,511 --> 00:18:53,174
<i>We're just energy.
All you have to do, is soar!</i>

313
00:18:53,253 --> 00:18:55,558
* (opera singing) *

314
00:19:42,542 --> 00:19:44,062
What the hell?

315
00:19:47,078 --> 00:19:49,560
Quite a surprise, Mr. Moore.

316
00:19:49,623 --> 00:19:53,237
My God,
that's the craziest thing I've ever seen.

317
00:19:53,453 --> 00:19:57,300
You must be a very lonely person.

318
00:19:59,321 --> 00:20:01,522
Come back when your balls drop!

319
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,438
Au revoir, mademoiselle.

320
00:20:05,518 --> 00:20:07,718
Seriously, come back when
your balls drop.

321
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:20,598
Dude, I am freaking out!

322
00:20:20,684 --> 00:20:22,449
You gotta tell me what
the deal is with the~

323
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:23,269
Dude?

324
00:20:23,981 --> 00:20:24,809
Dude?

325
00:20:24,983 --> 00:20:25,897
Okay.

326
00:20:26,365 --> 00:20:27,241
Dude, dude!

327
00:20:27,315 --> 00:20:28,333
Huh? Oh!

328
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:31,310
I remember you.

329
00:20:31,409 --> 00:20:32,948
You're the angry kid with no friends.

330
00:20:32,954 --> 00:20:34,954
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
stay with me here, now listen.

331
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:38,362
That YOUniverse app you put
on my phone, it's insane.

332
00:20:38,462 --> 00:20:41,187
It worked, the things that
I wished for happened.

333
00:20:42,128 --> 00:20:44,776
- Right.
- Then some things that I wished for,

334
00:20:44,782 --> 00:20:47,260
- didn't happen the way that I wanted them to.
- I know!

335
00:20:47,968 --> 00:20:48,695
Well?

336
00:20:48,701 --> 00:20:50,244
- Let me ask you a question.
- Yeah.

337
00:20:50,271 --> 00:20:54,441
If a unicorn wrote a tweet and then posted it,
and then he put it up and deleted it...

338
00:20:54,447 --> 00:20:57,463
and then a tree fell down in the forest,
does anybody even hear it?

339
00:20:57,469 --> 00:20:59,003
What are you talking about?

340
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:01,912
Listen, that YOUniverse app,
can you tell me how to control it?

341
00:21:01,918 --> 00:21:04,626
Can you tell me if I can take
back something that I posted?

342
00:21:04,632 --> 00:21:06,062
What do you want to take back?

343
00:21:14,682 --> 00:21:16,895
Whoa, dude!

344
00:21:17,073 --> 00:21:18,803
That's what you wished for?

345
00:21:19,732 --> 00:21:21,504
- Listen to me, man.
- What?

346
00:21:22,257 --> 00:21:25,318
You can't change the past,
that's crazy talk.

347
00:21:26,503 --> 00:21:27,603
Is this forever?

348
00:21:27,824 --> 00:21:28,877
Me and you?

349
00:21:29,352 --> 00:21:31,486
No, no, I'm talking about the app.

350
00:21:31,492 --> 00:21:32,531
- Oh, the app!
- Yes!

351
00:21:32,537 --> 00:21:34,637
- All I know is this.
- Yeah.

352
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:38,722
The YOUniverse is changing
thousands of times every second.

353
00:21:39,092 --> 00:21:41,193
You just gotta update your status.

354
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,789
Update my status.

355
00:21:51,801 --> 00:21:54,798
<i>- Update my status.
- The YOUniverse will assist.</i>

356
00:21:57,898 --> 00:21:59,042
My man!

357
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:01,472
Dad?

358
00:22:02,605 --> 00:22:03,804
What's up!?

359
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:05,292
- Hey.
- Hey.

360
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:09,488
I can't believe you're here.
What are you doing here?

361
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,465
Dude, I don't even know.

362
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:16,341
I woke up and I was like, I gotta get out of here.
I gotta go, I gotta go, so I just did.

363
00:22:16,478 --> 00:22:19,089
I don't know, I got on a plane.
Boom, I'm here.

364
00:22:19,095 --> 00:22:21,378
- Wow.
- Hey, why aren't you driving Born to Run?

365
00:22:21,899 --> 00:22:23,581
Mom says I have to get a job first.

366
00:22:23,587 --> 00:22:28,113
Heard that before. Listen, grab a sponge, all right?
Can't have ladies getting in a dirty ride.

367
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:29,158
You got it.

368
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,613
- So tell me something, what's been happening?
- Oh, you don't even know.

369
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:38,841
I've been skating and surfing every day,
12 hours a day sometimes.

370
00:22:39,089 --> 00:22:42,457
Hey! Anna Banana, how are you doing?

371
00:22:43,893 --> 00:22:46,210
Hey, killer, you want to give us a second?

372
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,069
Yeah.

373
00:22:53,894 --> 00:22:55,452
What are you doing here?

374
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:58,758
You look great.
I forgot what those scrubs do to you.

375
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,384
So great.

376
00:23:03,113 --> 00:23:07,459
I'm tellin' you, these waves
were toppin' out like at 30 feet.

377
00:23:07,465 --> 00:23:10,419
30 feet! That's like as big as this house!
I mean that's huge!

378
00:23:10,425 --> 00:23:12,515
I don't think you truly
appreciate how big this is.

379
00:23:12,521 --> 00:23:14,755
Annie, give 'em the arm wave,
show 'em, show 'em.

380
00:23:14,796 --> 00:23:17,205
All right, this is me
on my board, right?

381
00:23:17,307 --> 00:23:20,949
This is the 30-foot wave, look
at that! This is to scale, Maxi.

382
00:23:21,053 --> 00:23:25,935
Ugh, ugh, shred, shred, bleed,
bleed, pull, snap through. Thanks Ann.

383
00:23:26,043 --> 00:23:31,431
And they were just coming, one after the other.
And I surfed 'em, all day, all day, Allen!

384
00:23:31,474 --> 00:23:32,597
Into the evening, even.

385
00:23:32,609 --> 00:23:36,794
Then I fell asleep to the sounds of that angry ocean,
just pounding the beach.

386
00:23:43,935 --> 00:23:44,763
It was pretty great.

387
00:23:44,796 --> 00:23:48,137
Wake up the next day and
we did it all again. What?

388
00:23:48,989 --> 00:23:52,618
It was one of the best times I've ever had
in my entire life. Except for the time...

389
00:23:52,913 --> 00:23:56,165
you and I rebuilt the Alpha Romeo.
That was the best time I ever had in my life.

390
00:23:56,171 --> 00:23:59,811
- Hey, agreed! Born to Run!
- Born to Run! Cheers to that, my man.

391
00:23:59,817 --> 00:24:03,397
Well, it's good to have you back dad,
now Kyle has a shoulder to cry on.

392
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:05,266
Maxi, chill out.

393
00:24:05,538 --> 00:24:10,425
- So, Darryl, what do you plan on doing for work here?
- Well, I connected with an old skate buddy of mine,

394
00:24:10,431 --> 00:24:14,626
who's got his own brand out here in New Haven.
He's gonna hook me up with a job doin' graphics.

395
00:24:14,632 --> 00:24:17,654
It's a real job.
So I hit the ground running tomorrow.

396
00:24:17,781 --> 00:24:23,088
But, tonight, I just want to say,
that I am so happy to be here,

397
00:24:23,235 --> 00:24:27,921
hanging out, with that sexy,
little surfer chick, I met 22 years ago.

398
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:30,765
Do you remember that girl?
Anna Banana, I think her name was?

399
00:24:30,771 --> 00:24:32,355
- Sort of.
- Anna Banana.

400
00:24:33,154 --> 00:24:37,505
Annie, Kyle, Maxi...
I love you guys.

401
00:24:38,036 --> 00:24:40,303
There's no other place in the
universe I'd rather be.

402
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:43,535
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

403
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:45,469
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

404
00:24:45,842 --> 00:24:47,147
Cheers, Allen.

405
00:24:51,252 --> 00:24:52,590
<i>So what did I do?</i>

406
00:24:55,604 --> 00:24:57,012
<i>What would you do?</i>

407
00:24:57,019 --> 00:24:58,671
All right, YOUniverse...

408
00:25:00,338 --> 00:25:01,994
let's make some moves.

409
00:25:17,659 --> 00:25:19,269
Thank you, Doris.

410
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,492
- I want another shot.
- Huh?

411
00:25:21,525 --> 00:25:22,728
I want another shot.

412
00:25:22,878 --> 00:25:27,248
Uh, you want a Castrato role now? I don't think
you're gonna like the requirements very much.

413
00:25:27,254 --> 00:25:32,460
* You, suck! *

414
00:25:33,457 --> 00:25:37,338
See, that's how it's actually, done,
because I'm actually classically trained.

415
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:39,203
All right? Now get out of here.

416
00:25:46,356 --> 00:25:47,986
Hey, can I borrow that?

417
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:51,713
* One, two, one two three *

418

421

What did you think?

460
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:07,723
I had no idea what to expect after yesterday.
But oh my God, you friggin' killed it.

461
00:29:07,844 --> 00:29:10,177
I'm so happy.
I hated singing with Brian.

462
00:29:10,234 --> 00:29:14,864
The best part was watching Massey freak,
and then Mr. Moody kick him out of chorus! So good!

463
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:17,049
Since when did my brother
get so many friends?

464

And who has the non-dairy,
chocolate, caramel latte?

465
00:29:19,794 --> 00:29:22,614
Oh, that would be me,
the lactose intolerant one.

466
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:27,343
Can't drink milk, because it goes through me
like lava through a Philippine village, just~

467
00:29:28,069 --> 00:29:30,397
Just really thick.
Would you like to go out sometime?

468
00:29:31,945 --> 00:29:32,908
No, thanks.

469
00:29:33,581 --> 00:29:35,113
Is it because of the diarrhea?

470
00:29:40,203 --> 00:29:41,450
Brian's here.

471
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:47,835
Let's go, outside, you and me, right now.

472
00:29:47,837 --> 00:29:48,981
Brian, just go away.

473
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:52,222
You no longer have the privilege
of speaking to me.

474
00:29:52,439 --> 00:29:54,227
And when I'm selling out the Garden...

475
00:29:54,329 --> 00:29:58,238
- you'll all be kissing my waxed, platinum butt cheeks.
- Brian!

476
00:29:58,244 --> 00:30:01,547
- Zip it, GiGi Haddada!
- All right, that's it!

477
00:30:01,553 --> 00:30:04,166
- Kyle, don't, this is stupid.
- No, it's okay.

478
00:30:05,867 --> 00:30:06,984
Let's go.

479
00:30:17,332 --> 00:30:18,224
Brian!

480
00:30:18,723 --> 00:30:20,114
Brian, don't do this!

481
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,590
Kyle!

482
00:30:24,111 --> 00:30:25,493
Guys, come on!

483
00:30:27,875 --> 00:30:32,017
One rule... no touching my face.
This is my money maker.

484
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,722
Whoa.

485
00:30:46,483 --> 00:30:48,182
I am so gonna cream you!

486
00:30:49,077 --> 00:30:50,602
<i>* Somebody turn it up *</i>

487
00:30:51,345 --> 00:30:52,736
<i>* Somebody turn it up *</i>

488
00:30:53,515 --> 00:30:55,006
<i>* Somebody turn it up *</i>

489
00:30:55,594 --> 00:30:56,933
<i>* Somebody turn it up *</i>

490
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:59,352
<i>* Somebody turn it up *</i>

491
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:01,745
<i>* Somebody turn it up *</i>

492
00:31:09,344 --> 00:31:11,135
Be like water,
making its way through cracks.

493
00:31:11,156 --> 00:31:12,506
- You're dead!
- Kyle!

494
00:31:28,199 --> 00:31:30,733
Point taken. I'm good.

495
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:34,344
- Here you go, Gramps.
- Thank you.

496
00:31:35,695 --> 00:31:36,817
Hey, Anime...

497
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,292
I don't know what's going on with this look,
but I am digging it, big time.

498
00:31:40,474 --> 00:31:42,507
Our daughter is wearing a dog collar.

499
00:31:42,513 --> 00:31:45,683
Darryl, um, how was your first day?

500
00:31:46,099 --> 00:31:50,032
It went well. Yeah, it's just
a wait-and-see game now.

501
00:31:50,446 --> 00:31:53,292
What do you mean, wait and see?
I thought you said you had the job.

502
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:55,771
I do, I do, I just had
to meet my boy's partner.

503
00:31:55,858 --> 00:31:58,009
Big dog and pony show,
you know how it is.

504
00:31:58,102 --> 00:32:01,703
Don't worry, I got the job, okay?
Hey, killer, what gives?

505
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:04,834
We were supposed to meet down
at the skate park today. You stood me up.

506
00:32:04,976 --> 00:32:06,926
Sorry about that,
I got caught up.

507
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:09,648
He got into a fight.
You got in a fight?

508
00:32:09,654 --> 00:32:12,726
- Yeah, oh, yes.
- Maxi.

509
00:32:12,783 --> 00:32:14,745
You dropped him like a bad
habit, too, didn't you?

510
00:32:14,751 --> 00:32:17,519
- It wasn't a big deal, Mom.
- Um, it is a big deal.

511
00:32:17,525 --> 00:32:19,337
What is wrong with you?
Why are you fighting?

512
00:32:19,343 --> 00:32:21,622
Relax, okay?
There's nothing wrong with him,

513
00:32:21,628 --> 00:32:24,572
there's not a scratch on him.
He's looking good, he's walking tall.

514
00:32:24,578 --> 00:32:27,816
I taught my son not to act like that.

515
00:32:27,869 --> 00:32:30,335
Well, apparently he does,
and he wins.

516
00:32:30,894 --> 00:32:31,964
Give me some.

517
00:32:33,863 --> 00:32:36,522
Mom, I'm fine,
and it won't happen again.

518
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:39,621
- Can I be excused?
- Where you going?

519
00:32:40,273 --> 00:32:41,369
Meeting up with a friend.

520
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:44,921
Friends, singing in the chorus, fighting,
you're not that cool, dude.

521
00:32:45,058 --> 00:32:47,304
Get out of here, have fun,
enjoy your date.

522
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,942
Thanks. Thank you, Dad.

523
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:51,271
And try not to get in any fights.
See what I did.

524
00:32:51,348 --> 00:32:54,482
Hey hold on a second,
why don't you take the Alpha.

525
00:32:55,077 --> 00:32:56,257
You're the best, Dad!

526
00:32:57,669 --> 00:32:58,861
I am the best.

527
00:33:00,102 --> 00:33:01,228
What?

528
00:33:09,352 --> 00:33:10,852
Okay, where are we going?

529
00:33:11,066 --> 00:33:16,973
If you could do, anything... in the world,
right now... what would it be?

530
00:33:18,174 --> 00:33:22,225
I would... ride a Ferris wheel.

531
00:33:22,311 --> 00:33:24,242
- Really?
- Yeah, mm-hm.

532
00:33:25,657 --> 00:33:27,930
- Why?
- I love Ferris wheels.

533
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:30,294
I've loved them ever since
I was a little girl.

534
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:33,868
Well, you're in luck.

535
00:33:34,891 --> 00:33:36,750
I just happen to know where one is.

536
00:33:39,927 --> 00:33:42,442
<i>* I know that we will *</i>

537
00:33:42,544 --> 00:33:44,801
<i>* We will last forever *</i>

538
00:33:44,807 --> 00:33:46,827
Oh, oh, no.

539
00:33:47,752 --> 00:33:50,033
<i>* I promise we will *</i>

540
00:33:50,089 --> 00:33:51,401
<i>* We will last forever *</i>

541
00:33:51,501 --> 00:33:53,108
- Oh my God!
- You like it?

542
00:33:53,247 --> 00:33:57,679
Oh, my God, this is so good.
Where did it even come from?

543
00:33:57,801 --> 00:34:01,251
One night only... and it's all for us.

544
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,179
Come on.

545
00:34:04,979 --> 00:34:06,898
This is just to good.

546
00:34:07,901 --> 00:34:09,049
Hello.

547
00:34:09,337 --> 00:34:10,981
Well, hi.

548
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,903
- Right this way.
- Thank you.

549
00:34:13,069 --> 00:34:14,768
Thanks.

550
00:34:19,662 --> 00:34:20,844
This feels right.

551
00:34:24,526 --> 00:34:27,160
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

552
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:34,822
- Yeah!
- This is so cool.

553
00:34:34,824 --> 00:34:35,990
Yeah, it is.

554
00:34:35,992 --> 00:34:37,242
Everything you wanted?

555
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:39,208
Oh, this is like, this is the dream.

556
00:34:39,405 --> 00:34:41,372
I'm obsessed with this.

557
00:34:43,099 --> 00:34:43,969
Oh, yeah.

558
00:34:43,996 --> 00:34:46,428
Hey, how do you like singing
with our chorus?

559
00:34:46,812 --> 00:34:47,989
- I like it.
- Yeah?

560
00:34:47,995 --> 00:34:50,896
I just wish we were singing
something more... now.

561
00:34:51,138 --> 00:34:53,007
- Yes.
- Or at least 2003.

562
00:34:53,013 --> 00:34:55,514
Mm-hm. Mr. Moody plays it so safe.

563
00:34:55,782 --> 00:34:58,428
It's probably why Hayden
has never won the Slam.

564
00:34:58,604 --> 00:34:59,491
Hm.

565
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,982
Man, it would feel so good
just to win one time.

566
00:35:06,732 --> 00:35:10,788
We're gonna win the Slam
this year... I promise.

567
00:35:20,976 --> 00:35:22,823
This is the perfect fall night.

568
00:35:25,437 --> 00:35:27,458
- I've never seen fall before.
- No.

569
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:28,824
I'm from Huntington Beach.

570
00:35:28,888 --> 00:35:32,951
Well, you are in for a treat,
because nothing beats New England falls.

571
00:35:34,793 --> 00:35:36,826
Have you ever heard of the
Heavenly Pursuit?

572
00:35:37,022 --> 00:35:38,015
What's that?

573
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:41,949
Okay, well, autumn is the time
of year that the moon...

574
00:35:42,058 --> 00:35:45,905
after pursuing the sun, since spring,
finally catches up to her.

575
00:35:46,563 --> 00:35:50,806
But, then he out distances her,
and, the whole pursuit begins again.

576
00:35:51,235 --> 00:35:54,126
It's kind of like,
two lovers who lose one another.

577
00:35:54,345 --> 00:36:00,503
But, his love is so powerful that...
he spends his entire life trying to find her.

578
00:36:01,804 --> 00:36:03,287
That sounds kinda tragic.

579
00:36:03,634 --> 00:36:08,486
Yeah, I know, I'm a total sucker
for a tragic love story.

580
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:12,180
But I think every girl wants a moon.

581
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,790
Yeah.

582
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,976
This has been the coolest night.

583
00:36:28,903 --> 00:36:29,813
Yeah.

584
00:36:36,483 --> 00:36:39,691
I don't get it, I've lived here my whole life
and no one even knows who I am.

585
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,495
Come on, that's not true.

586
00:36:41,506 --> 00:36:42,918
- Hi, Liza.
- Who are you?

587
00:36:42,961 --> 00:36:45,717
Lonnie Gregory, your next door
neighbor for the past 17 years.

588
00:36:45,723 --> 00:36:47,344
Doesn't ring a bell. Sorry.

589
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:50,084
Course not, hey, thanks for not
inviting me to your Sweet 16.

590
00:36:50,122 --> 00:36:52,691
It was beautiful from what I saw
from the window anyways.

591
00:36:52,697 --> 00:36:54,196
But that's what I mean, you.

592
00:36:54,202 --> 00:36:55,589
You show up four weeks ago,

593
00:36:55,595 --> 00:36:59,345
and now your life is like this
amazing fairy tale, right?

594
00:36:59,407 --> 00:37:03,932
I keep thinking about it. I mean it's like,
it's a little annoying, actually, but in a good way.

595
00:37:04,771 --> 00:37:06,844
Okay Lonnie,
I have to tell you something.

596
00:37:06,928 --> 00:37:10,063
But you gotta promise me that
you won't tell anyone. Promise?

597
00:37:10,237 --> 00:37:12,427
- Yeah, not even Mom.
- You sure? You talk a lot.

598
00:37:12,433 --> 00:37:14,499
- I know I talk a lot, just tell me.
- Okay, okay.

599
00:37:14,596 --> 00:37:19,520
I have a magic app on my phone...
and whatever I post on it... comes true.

600
00:37:21,427 --> 00:37:24,621
- I'm sorry, what? What?
- It's insane.

601
00:37:24,681 --> 00:37:27,760
Oh my God, I have the same app,
I thought I was the only one.

602
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:30,397
- Really?
- Yeah, no, dude! Come on, you lost your mind.

603
00:37:30,403 --> 00:37:33,076
- Lonnie, I'm telling the truth.
- Okay, fine, if that was even a possibility,

604
00:37:33,082 --> 00:37:35,217
which I'm not saying that it is,
how would that even work?

605
00:37:35,223 --> 00:37:40,048
I'll tell you, okay, so my phone broke,
so I took it to the mall to this bearded dude.

606
00:37:40,054 --> 00:37:41,195
- Bearded dude?
- Bearded dude.

607
00:37:41,201 --> 00:37:43,730
He gave me a new phone with this
app called YOUniverse on it.

608
00:37:43,736 --> 00:37:45,764
The YOUniverse is always eavesdropping.

609
00:37:45,824 --> 00:37:48,777
There's this unicorn,
and if the unicorn posts a tweet in the woods,

610
00:37:48,783 --> 00:37:51,283
and then deletes the tweet,
does it make a sound?

611
00:37:51,831 --> 00:37:55,752
Oh, man, you Californians, okay.

612
00:37:56,389 --> 00:37:58,578
I'm not crazy. I'm telling you the truth.

613
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:01,767
It does sound crazy, because
it's bullshit, all right?

614
00:38:01,773 --> 00:38:02,499
Lonnie!

615
00:38:02,505 --> 00:38:05,082
Look, if anyone understands the
need for fantasy, it's me.

616
00:38:05,088 --> 00:38:07,596
I mean, I spend more of my time
on Azeroth than I do on earth.

617
00:38:07,602 --> 00:38:11,659
But, I don't go around trying to convince people
that I'm Archmage Khadgar the Wizard.

618
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:13,913
Maybe you guys do things
differently in California.

619
00:38:13,988 --> 00:38:17,702
Maybe it's the avocados, maybe it's the stuff
everyone's smoking, you know what I'm saying?

620
00:38:17,708 --> 00:38:20,522
But, we don't do things like that.
No one~ What is that?

621
00:38:20,528 --> 00:38:23,017
This is a gift.
This is my favorite skateboard.

622
00:38:23,097 --> 00:38:25,395
- Cool.
- And I want to give it to you.

623
00:38:25,448 --> 00:38:27,382
- What?
- I want you to have it.

624
00:38:27,595 --> 00:38:30,126
- It's for you, come on.
- That's so awesome.

625
00:38:31,967 --> 00:38:35,739
That's the nose, that's the tail.
And those two bolts, are what you stand on.

626
00:38:35,745 --> 00:38:38,830
Oh, I don't know, my ankles, remember?
And it's like the height.

627
00:38:38,836 --> 00:38:42,518
- Lonnie, get on the board.
- I'm afraid of heights. Okay, here I go, um.

628
00:38:44,262 --> 00:38:45,716
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

629
00:38:46,162 --> 00:38:48,247
You smell like avocados.
You smell so good.

630
00:38:48,253 --> 00:38:50,744
What do you put in your hair?
It's, my hair's just~

631
00:38:51,604 --> 00:38:52,821
- You're good.
- It's so high up here.

632
00:38:52,827 --> 00:38:54,147
- Does anybody get a nose bleed?
- You're gonna be fine, Lonnie.

633
00:38:54,153 --> 00:38:55,528
- How high up are we right now?
- An inch.

634
00:38:55,534 --> 00:38:58,428
An inch, that's a lot.
Just, what do I do now?

635
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,310
You kick back and enjoy
the ride.

636
00:39:00,316 --> 00:39:02,578
Oh, my God, I'm getting light hands,
because it's so hot.

637
00:39:02,584 --> 00:39:03,993
Whoa, whoa! What's going on!?

638
00:39:03,999 --> 00:39:06,183
I'm not doing anything.
Why is it taking off?

639
00:39:06,323 --> 00:39:08,985
Whoa, I'm actually skateboard~
Get out of the way!

640
00:39:09,549 --> 00:39:10,805
Look at me!

641
00:39:17,441 --> 00:39:18,707
Whoa, whoa.

642
00:39:23,656 --> 00:39:25,814
Look at you rip, doggie!

643
00:39:26,742 --> 00:39:28,093
Yeah!

644
00:39:28,888 --> 00:39:30,454
Is that Grimace?

645
00:39:30,652 --> 00:39:33,638
It's me, Lonnie.
You don't know my name, that's okay.

646
00:39:33,732 --> 00:39:37,934
<i>* Can't you hear what I say *</i>

647
00:39:37,981 --> 00:39:40,982
<i>* Just get out of my way *</i>

648
00:39:43,903 --> 00:39:46,099
<i>* Just get out of my way *</i>

649
00:39:46,202 --> 00:39:47,277
Watch this.

650
00:39:47,776 --> 00:39:51,978
This is the coolest thing I've
ever done! Like, by far!

651
00:39:52,277 --> 00:39:54,911
It's the best day of my life!

652
00:39:56,669 --> 00:39:59,348
Lonnie! Lonnie!

653
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:02,360
Lonnie! You all right, man?
How many fingers?

654
00:40:02,403 --> 00:40:04,591
- You have fingers.
- Come on, let's get you up.

655
00:40:04,597 --> 00:40:07,597
You gotta watch what you're eating,
I mean, going.

656
00:40:07,724 --> 00:40:10,315
What do you think you're doing?
You could've seriously hurt him.

657
00:40:10,321 --> 00:40:12,609
Well it's not my fault he's fat, and uncoordinated.

658
00:40:13,088 --> 00:40:14,047
Yeah?

659
00:40:16,402 --> 00:40:19,931
Well if it's so easy, why don't you try it?

660
00:40:20,716 --> 00:40:22,981
Or are you just some pussy in a letter jacket?

661
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:32,109
Look at me, I'm riding a skateboard.

662
00:40:32,145 --> 00:40:34,004
- What are you doing?
- Watch this.

663
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:35,221
It's so easy.

664
00:40:36,124 --> 00:40:39,062
Whoa, what? Whoa, slow down.

665
00:40:39,154 --> 00:40:41,434
Yo, what is going on?
Yo, guys, stop this.

666
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,875
Yo, Oliver! Dude, hey, dude!

667
00:40:45,106 --> 00:40:47,647
Stop, stop! Move back away!

668
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:02,681
Aren't you going to study
for the Spanish test?

669
00:41:02,718 --> 00:41:03,747
I'm just gonna wing it.

670
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:08,415
Okay, wow, you know, you are the only person I know,
that never studies and gets all A's.

671
00:41:10,344 --> 00:41:12,726
- You write music?
- Oh, it's nothing.

672
00:41:13,682 --> 00:41:15,049
Sing something for me.

673
00:41:15,477 --> 00:41:16,642
No.

674
00:41:17,186 --> 00:41:19,437
Okay, shut your face,
it's not happening.

675
00:41:19,786 --> 00:41:21,039
Dani, I don't know!

676
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:23,368
I've never heard of the game
Truth or Dare before!

677
00:41:23,374 --> 00:41:24,602
What are you doing?
My mom will hear you.

678
00:41:24,608 --> 00:41:26,751
- Dani, what are you doing?
- Kyle, stop it!

679
00:41:26,757 --> 00:41:28,161
Dani, what's going on up there?

680
00:41:28,167 --> 00:41:29,790
Nothing, Mom! Nothing!

681
00:41:30,392 --> 00:41:32,670
Stop it. You're a freak.

682
00:41:34,106 --> 00:41:35,187
Get over there.

683
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:41,299
If you so much as roll your eyes,
I swear, I'll murder you.

684
00:41:41,829 --> 00:41:44,442
All right, cross my heart and hope to die.

685
00:41:47,527 --> 00:41:48,498
Drowning?

686
00:41:48,531 --> 00:41:51,218
Mm-hm, yes, I know,
it sounds a little morbid, but,

687
00:41:51,224 --> 00:41:54,552
it's really just a conversation
between two people falling in love.

688
00:41:54,668 --> 00:41:57,839
Yeah, leave it to me to write a
song that sounds like a eulogy.

689
00:41:57,845 --> 00:42:00,533
Whoa, wait, wait, wait.
You gotta sing it for me.

690
00:42:00,539 --> 00:42:02,396
- No, Kyle, no, you know I'm not~
- Just a few verses, please?

691
00:42:02,402 --> 00:42:04,836
Just a few verses, that's all I'm asking for.

692
00:42:05,383 --> 00:42:06,672
Agh.

693
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:22,168
* Seems like the love songs have got it all wrong *

694
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,990
* I thought I would fly *

695
00:42:27,647 --> 00:42:31,695
* And it's getting darker the further we fall *

696
00:42:32,452 --> 00:42:34,497
* And I'm feeling high *

697
00:42:35,568 --> 00:42:37,219
That's great... here.

698
00:42:40,773 --> 00:42:42,139
I think I got it.

699
00:42:42,585 --> 00:42:44,218
- Okay.
- Keep singing.

700
00:42:46,002 --> 00:42:49,793
* Remember the time I first saw you *

701
00:42:50,139 --> 00:42:54,564
* I thought you'd be mine and it felt so good *

702
00:42:54,977 --> 00:42:59,528
* One look in your eyes and I swear I knew *

703
00:43:00,669 --> 00:43:05,125
* Of your kiss, your touch, your love *

704
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:10,464
* And I can't breathe *

705
00:43:12,998 --> 00:43:15,201
* I'm struggling *

706
00:43:15,382 --> 00:43:17,601
* Hey hey hey *

707
00:43:18,101 --> 00:43:20,827
* My heart's at ease *

708
00:43:23,688 --> 00:43:25,703
* 'Cause I'm drowning *

709
00:43:26,953 --> 00:43:31,362
* Drowning in your love *

710
00:43:39,999 --> 00:43:41,411
Oh!

711
00:43:42,145 --> 00:43:43,939
That was bad, let me try it again.

712
00:43:44,312 --> 00:43:46,806
Oh... so close!

713
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:05,318
* Now I've heard there was a secret chord *

714
00:44:05,543 --> 00:44:08,986
* That David played, and pleased the Lord *

715
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:13,415
* But you don't really care for music do you *

716
00:44:13,509 --> 00:44:14,721
Wait, guys, guys, hold on.

717
00:44:14,727 --> 00:44:17,694
Hold up. What is it now, Pavarotti?

718
00:44:17,785 --> 00:44:21,442
Mr. Moody, Dani and I have been working on something,
that we'd love to show you.

719
00:44:21,448 --> 00:44:22,571
Kyle, what are you doing?

720
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:25,351
Kyle, I've been doing this a long time.
I think I know what song is going to work.

721
00:44:25,357 --> 00:44:28,242
I know, but Dani wrote this song
and it's tight, Mr. Moody...

722
00:44:28,403 --> 00:44:29,538
just, hear it out.

723
00:44:29,582 --> 00:44:31,043
I'm sure it's very 'tight'.

724
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:34,149
It's just that, this song,
has a significance, for me.

725
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:35,292
Why?

726
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:37,032
- Because I sang it once.
- What for?

727
00:44:37,063 --> 00:44:38,896
- Mr. Pookins.
- Who's Mr. Pookins?

728
00:44:38,902 --> 00:44:40,908
- My cat.
- You sang a song for your cat?

729
00:44:40,914 --> 00:44:44,292
My dead cat, he died,
I sang it at his funeral.

730
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,272
Sorry.

731
00:44:47,531 --> 00:44:49,031
It was a suicide.

732
00:44:51,113 --> 00:44:53,313
Can we just play the song
for you once, please?

733
00:44:53,366 --> 00:44:54,532
You won't regret it.

734
00:44:55,012 --> 00:44:56,786
- Do the short version.
- Yeah.

735
00:45:02,257 --> 00:45:03,357
You got this.

736
00:45:07,867 --> 00:45:10,266
* The ocean is heavy *

737
00:45:12,014 --> 00:45:13,921
* Your current is strong *

738
00:45:16,156 --> 00:45:18,396
* You're pulling me deeper *

739
00:45:20,298 --> 00:45:22,103
* Been here all along *

740
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:28,256
* Remember the time I first saw you *

741
00:45:28,564 --> 00:45:32,405
* I thought you'd be mine and it felt so good *

742
00:45:32,687 --> 00:45:36,652
* One look in your eyes and I swear I knew *

743
00:45:37,527 --> 00:45:41,249
* Of your kiss, your touch, your love *

744
00:45:42,237 --> 00:45:44,871
I can not believe Mr. Moody is
letting us perform our song.

745
00:45:44,888 --> 00:45:46,825
Our song?
It's your song, I just helped.

746
00:45:46,831 --> 00:45:50,965
<i>Tonight's the night Hawks hockey
season opener, be there, 7:00PM.</i>

747
00:45:51,109 --> 00:45:53,076
What is with the hockey insanity?

748
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,051
First game of the year is tonight.

749
00:45:55,082 --> 00:45:57,492
What's even worse,
is the biggest game of the season,

750
00:45:57,509 --> 00:45:59,169
is the same night as the Slam.

751
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:01,502
I'll be so surprised if anybody
even shows up.

752
00:46:01,532 --> 00:46:04,905
Hey, you all should go to the Slam!
I'm telling you, if not, you're gonna miss out,

753
00:46:04,911 --> 00:46:07,912
and you're gonna have to watch
it on YouTube. I'm telling you.

754
00:46:09,473 --> 00:46:12,610
You know, nobody but you
could've got me to share my music.

755
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:14,355
Thank you.

756
00:46:15,148 --> 00:46:16,386
I'm happy I met you.

757
00:46:16,837 --> 00:46:18,748
I'm, kind of happy I met you.

758
00:46:18,759 --> 00:46:20,187
You're so dumb.

759
00:46:25,515 --> 00:46:27,448
I gotta go to class, bye.

760
00:46:29,692 --> 00:46:31,742
- Bye!
- Later, gator.

761
00:46:33,084 --> 00:46:35,118
- Jesus.
- Isn't that sweet?

762
00:46:35,277 --> 00:46:37,701
The lady and the tramp were
about to have their first kiss.

763
00:46:37,894 --> 00:46:39,309
What's with you, Massey?

764
00:46:39,315 --> 00:46:42,280
I Google Chrome-d you... and
there's not a single mention,

765
00:46:42,286 --> 00:46:45,078
of you singing anywhere
before you came to Hayden.

766
00:46:45,086 --> 00:46:48,288
Something about you stinks,
and I'm gonna figure it out.

767
00:46:48,594 --> 00:46:51,628
And then, I'm gonna stuff, and mount you.

768
00:46:57,286 --> 00:47:01,024
All I'm saying is be careful,
things are rarely what they appear to be.

769
00:47:01,317 --> 00:47:04,730
Take my girlfriend from Honduras,
the bikini model, Guadalupe?

770
00:47:04,865 --> 00:47:08,325
She turned out to be Phil, from Cleveland.

771
00:47:08,749 --> 00:47:11,203
Yeah, I got Catfished...

772
00:47:11,305 --> 00:47:13,363
- without the TV show!
- What are you getting at?

773
00:47:13,369 --> 00:47:15,861
I'm sayin, we don't know anything
about this bearded dude.

774
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:18,514
I mean, what if he turns out to
be some kind of like, you know...

775
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,484
master of dark arts.

776
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:22,357
Look, anything that got my
family back together, can't be bad.

777
00:47:22,363 --> 00:47:25,051
Yeah? Speaking of family...

778
00:47:25,057 --> 00:47:28,865
um, it's my birthday Saturday and
every year, we go to my favorite place.

779
00:47:28,871 --> 00:47:31,489
It's a Greek restaurant,
there's hummus, there's a belly dancer.

780
00:47:31,495 --> 00:47:34,006
Yeah, I took some lessons.
She asked me to leave,

781
00:47:34,012 --> 00:47:36,550
but I'm wondering, if you wanted to go,
you could go, it's gonna be lame...

782
00:47:36,556 --> 00:47:37,638
you probably... no, forget it.

783
00:47:37,644 --> 00:47:40,493
Lonnie! Of course, I'm coming to your birthday.

784
00:47:40,928 --> 00:47:41,919
I wouldn't miss it.

785
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:44,553
Cool. All right, I'll just text
you all the deets and stuff.

786
00:47:48,827 --> 00:47:48,827
Line by line resync and more
by Dandysubs on 20180421.

787
00:47:49,799 --> 00:47:53,861
- That guy is such a douche.
- Yeah, but he's Emperor Douche.

788
00:47:53,867 --> 00:47:57,350
And you just joined the chorus, so you're kind of like,
at the bottom of the barrel, too, you know?

789
00:47:57,356 --> 00:47:58,406
Jealous, Chorus Boy?

790
00:47:58,412 --> 00:47:59,413
- No.
- Hey!

791
00:47:59,603 --> 00:48:01,864
Oh ho, gettin' a little angry?

792
00:48:02,185 --> 00:48:04,294
No one cares about Kyle Moore.

793
00:48:04,515 --> 00:48:07,762
I own this school, and there's not a
damn thing you can do about it.

794
00:48:07,879 --> 00:48:09,422
Down... boy.

795
00:48:13,805 --> 00:48:17,401
Jokes on him, this is how I eat
my mashed potatoes, so~

796
00:48:17,764 --> 00:48:19,234
Somebody has to bring that guy in check.

797
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,158
Yeah, somebody's gotta check him.

798
00:48:21,322 --> 00:48:25,946
It would be kind of cool if you went out for the hockey
team, though, right, beat him at his own game?

799
00:48:25,952 --> 00:48:27,645
Our own little miracle on ice.

800
00:48:27,651 --> 00:48:30,234
That would be so rad, dude, so rad.

801
00:48:30,315 --> 00:48:33,304
Yeah, it would.

802
00:48:35,269 --> 00:48:37,098
Let's go! Let's go!

803
00:48:38,427 --> 00:48:39,893
Pass it!

804
00:48:43,757 --> 00:48:46,282
Come on! What are you, girls?
Let's go!

805
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:49,996
Come on, get up, you push!
That's the best you got?

806
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:52,661
You skate like my sister.
Bring it in!

807
00:48:52,788 --> 00:48:54,295
Two-on-two back check drill.

808
00:48:54,301 --> 00:48:58,208
If we're gonna beat the Bulldogs...
we gotta get this right.

809
00:48:58,569 --> 00:48:59,886
Look who it is.

810
00:49:00,642 --> 00:49:01,777
Set it up!

811
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:03,495
Whoa.

812
00:49:08,616 --> 00:49:11,850
Can I ah... can I help you with something?

813
00:49:12,392 --> 00:49:13,944
I want a try-out, Coach.

814
00:49:15,224 --> 00:49:16,848
Try-outs are over, all right?

815
00:49:16,997 --> 00:49:19,400
That's too bad.
I'm way better than Derek.

816
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,085
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
that's a pretty big claim, son.

817
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:28,722
Let's hope you can back that up.
The ice... is yours.

818
00:49:28,872 --> 00:49:30,993
Can't wait to see this.

819
00:49:42,428 --> 00:49:46,063
No, YOUniverse, we're here to play hockey.
No, no, no, no!

820
00:49:48,426 --> 00:49:50,570
Not again!

821
00:49:54,562 --> 00:49:56,003
What are you doing?

822
00:50:00,511 --> 00:50:02,010
Whoa!

823
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:11,631
You can't even do that.

824
00:50:13,184 --> 00:50:14,560
I can't look away.

825
00:50:15,774 --> 00:50:17,227
That is so beautiful.

826
00:50:23,633 --> 00:50:26,909
Holy smokes!

827
00:50:34,456 --> 00:50:36,189
That's not what I meant.

828
00:50:36,425 --> 00:50:40,236
Well, kid, you're no Wayne Gretzy but,
guess what, you made the team.

829
00:50:40,361 --> 00:50:42,680
Boys, meet your new equipment manager.

830
00:50:42,751 --> 00:50:46,580
All right! Play time's over.
Let's go! Set 'em up.

831
00:50:46,625 --> 00:50:47,974
Nice one, Cali.

832
00:50:52,878 --> 00:50:55,098
Wayne Gretzky.
Why didn't I think of that.

833
00:50:55,836 --> 00:50:59,078
All right, let's try this again, shall we?

834
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:09,733
Hey, bitches! Where you goin'?
I'm not done yet.

835
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:16,044
Okay ah, Frozen...
let's see you score on the goalie.

836
00:51:17,066 --> 00:51:18,118
Wreck him.

837
00:51:18,253 --> 00:51:19,638
Get the ice packs ready.

838
00:51:30,826 --> 00:51:31,892
Get him!

839
00:51:38,694 --> 00:51:40,036
Come on!

840
00:51:42,255 --> 00:51:44,156
<i>* Like a boss *</i>

841
00:51:45,228 --> 00:51:48,176
<i>* We are the wild beast *</i>

842
00:51:51,738 --> 00:51:54,151

843
00:51:54,919 --> 00:51:56,489

844
00:51:57,456 --> 00:52:00,210

00:52:00,586 --> 00:52:03,505

00:52:09,921 --> 00:52:12,359
<i>* We take the low road *</i>

849
00:52:12,474 --> 00:52:13,993
First line, get out there!

850
00:52:14,894 --> 00:52:17,682
Not you, Lowe, stay put.
How you feeling, baby?

851
00:52:17,876 --> 00:52:18,827
I could go all night.

852
00:52:18,833 --> 00:52:21,309
Well then, get out there and take the face off!

853
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:25,031
Jeez! Come on! Come on! All right. Whoo!

854
00:52:29,879 --> 00:52:31,812
- How good is he?
- Okay, Kyle!

855
00:52:32,243 --> 00:52:34,422
What are you doing?
Why aren't you out there?

856
00:52:34,446 --> 00:52:36,343
Let's go. Come on, boys!

857
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:45,607
<i>* I am your champion *</i>

858

867
00:53:31,655 --> 00:53:33,344
Kyle, you're so cool!

868
00:53:39,092 --> 00:53:40,406
- Hey.
- What up?

869
00:53:41,136 --> 00:53:42,450
What are you wearing?

870
00:53:42,776 --> 00:53:44,320
It's pretty sweet, right?

871
00:53:44,529 --> 00:53:47,483
You'll never guess,
I just saw a bunch of kids rocking my jersey!

872
00:53:47,505 --> 00:53:49,306
- Wow.
- I can't believe it, it's insane.

873
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:51,487
You know,
you missed rehearsal this morning.

874
00:53:53,351 --> 00:53:54,929
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

875
00:53:54,935 --> 00:53:57,336
I couldn't sleep last night after the game.

876
00:53:57,593 --> 00:53:58,914
But it won't happen again.

877
00:53:58,955 --> 00:54:02,469
You know, I'm a little worried you're not
gonna have enough time for rehearsal now.

878
00:54:02,475 --> 00:54:05,118
You know that the Slam,
is the same night as the game.

879
00:54:05,124 --> 00:54:08,717
Dani, Chorus is way more
important to me than hockey.

880
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:10,160
I'll make it work.

881
00:54:14,576 --> 00:54:18,012
Dude! I got 2.000 likes,
on my last Instagram post.

882
00:54:18,110 --> 00:54:21,061
What? Every time I post something,
I lose followers.

883
00:54:21,482 --> 00:54:24,548
Hey, so, my parents, they are super stoked,
to meet you Saturday.

884
00:54:24,702 --> 00:54:27,432
- Oh, yeah, I'm psyched to meet them, too.
- Yeah, this is funny...

885
00:54:27,438 --> 00:54:28,973
they actually don't think you exist.

886
00:54:28,979 --> 00:54:31,066
My dad sat me down the other day,
and he was like...

887
00:54:31,072 --> 00:54:32,829
"Is this 'Kyle' another 'Gary Wiggins'?"

888
00:54:32,835 --> 00:54:33,847
Who's Gary Wiggins?

889
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:35,655
He was my imaginary friend, when I was a kid.

890
00:54:35,661 --> 00:54:38,591
Not anymore, 'cause he moved away,
didn't leave a forwarding address.

891
00:54:38,597 --> 00:54:40,830
Anywho, my parents are super
excited that you're coming,

892
00:54:40,836 --> 00:54:43,003
so I'm stoked for them to see,
that you're real.

893
00:54:43,009 --> 00:54:44,503
Moore!

894
00:54:46,552 --> 00:54:48,552
- What's up?!
- Good, man, how are you?

895
00:54:48,648 --> 00:54:52,138
Moore, come sit with us, my man.
We're celebrating tonight's win.

896
00:54:52,736 --> 00:54:55,010
That's all right.
I'll catch up with you guys tomorrow.

897
00:54:55,016 --> 00:54:59,553
No, no, go with them. I gotta go home anyways,
and do some gaming. I'm a gamer, so~

898
00:54:59,639 --> 00:55:00,444
You sure?

899
00:55:00,508 --> 00:55:02,286
- Yeah, no, celebrate.
- Cool.

900
00:55:02,292 --> 00:55:03,088
- Yeah, go.
- Okay.

901
00:55:03,094 --> 00:55:04,443
- Come on.
- Yeah.

902
00:55:04,806 --> 00:55:06,254
- There he is.
- Yeah.

903
00:55:08,326 --> 00:55:10,137
So ah, where's Derek?

904
00:55:10,487 --> 00:55:12,756
Probably picking the splinters out of his ass,
from sitting all game.

905
00:55:12,762 --> 00:55:15,033
The Zamboni saw more ice than he did.

906
00:55:15,243 --> 00:55:16,264
Can I get you anything?

907
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:18,722
Yes, I'll have a cheeseburger,
fries and a shake.

908
00:55:18,841 --> 00:55:21,977
Oh my God, Cassie!
What are you gonna name your food baby?

909
00:55:23,534 --> 00:55:27,944
J-k, obviously.
I'll just take a stick of celery, please.

910
00:55:29,237 --> 00:55:31,179
- Hi.
- Hi.

911
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,119
- I'm Charlotte.
- Yeah, I know.

912
00:55:33,135 --> 00:55:33,736
Cool.

913
00:55:33,742 --> 00:55:36,969
So, how's it feel to be the guy
that everyone's talking about?

914
00:55:37,232 --> 00:55:38,698
I don't know if that's true.

915
00:55:41,082 --> 00:55:43,145
I bought a new perfume.
Do you want to smell me?

916
00:55:44,593 --> 00:55:45,920
Uh~

917
00:55:48,099 --> 00:55:50,631
Yeah. I do, I mean, sure.

918
00:56:00,081 --> 00:56:01,116
Do you like it?

919
00:56:01,455 --> 00:56:02,554
I-I love it.

920
00:56:03,486 --> 00:56:05,102
I'm not wearing any perfume.

921
00:56:07,272 --> 00:56:09,067
Cassie's having a party this Saturday.

922
00:56:09,172 --> 00:56:10,169
I am?

923
00:56:11,122 --> 00:56:14,765
Oh right, that party.
Of course, I am.

924
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:16,568
Do you have plans?

925
00:56:16,985 --> 00:56:19,069
Saturday, no, I don't think so, no.

926
00:56:19,481 --> 00:56:21,659
Well, now you do.

927
00:56:23,881 --> 00:56:27,054
<i>* Tonight is the night, yeah.
You know we gonna run *</i>

928
00:56:27,212 --> 00:56:30,428
<i>* We do this all the time
All right tonight's the night *</i>

929
00:56:31,023 --> 00:56:32,832
<i>* Yeah, you know
I'm in the mood *</i>

930
00:56:32,957 --> 00:56:36,445
<i>* Yeah you know we shine so bright,
tonight's the night, yeah *</i>

931
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:38,212
<i>* You know that's how we do *</i>

932
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:41,931
<i>* So Baby Girl come on take
flight tonight's the night, yeah *</i>

933
00:56:42,367 --> 00:56:43,741
<i>* You know we're coming through *</i>

934
00:56:43,834 --> 00:56:47,479
<i>* And I'm ah make you feel all right,
tonight's the night, yeah *</i>

935
00:56:47,681 --> 00:56:49,448
<i>* Hey yo step up on the scene *</i>

936
00:56:49,607 --> 00:56:52,341
<i>* Gotta stay fresh so fly super clean *</i>

937
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:02,395
What's up, man? Where you been, bro?
Everyone's out back.

938
00:57:02,401 --> 00:57:04,234
Come on, let's go, let's go.

939
00:57:07,412 --> 00:57:11,948
My man! Hey, you look thirsty.
Let's go.

940
00:57:12,691 --> 00:57:14,437
No one told me it was a costume party.

941
00:57:14,443 --> 00:57:15,830
Don't worry about it, bro.

942
00:57:15,843 --> 00:57:18,973
Boys! The man of the hour has arrived!

943
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,209
To hockey!
One-timers, slap shots and kick saves!

944
00:57:26,428 --> 00:57:29,611
Bone crushing hits that send
opponents to their graves.

945
00:57:29,738 --> 00:57:32,272
Hat tricks, power plays and crosschecks.

946
00:57:32,485 --> 00:57:35,521
Hayden Hawks hockey, it's better than sex!

947
00:57:37,134 --> 00:57:38,567
Drink up, boys.

948
00:57:43,078 --> 00:57:46,877
It's the golden boy,
the king of the ice.

949
00:57:46,949 --> 00:57:50,807
Just remember... ice breaks,
and when it does...

950
00:57:51,006 --> 00:57:55,547
all these people are gonna do...
is hold your little blonde hair under the water.

951
00:58:02,246 --> 00:58:05,562
Don't worry about that.
He's just sore 'cause Charlotte cut him loose.

952
00:58:05,568 --> 00:58:06,845
Charlotte broke up with him?

953
00:58:06,851 --> 00:58:10,729
OMG. Are you gonna pay any
attention to me tonight or what?

954
00:58:10,804 --> 00:58:12,670
Hey, Cassie, sick party.

955
00:58:12,719 --> 00:58:17,976
Do you like my costume?
I'm a very naughty brave.

956
00:58:18,936 --> 00:58:22,512
Of course, I like it.
I wore it last year.

957
00:58:22,924 --> 00:58:24,417
I don't remember th~

958
00:58:25,848 --> 00:58:27,172
Want to go for a walk?

959
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:30,224
Yeah.

960
00:58:34,688 --> 00:58:37,438
Damn, he just made Derek, disappear.

961
00:58:48,088 --> 00:58:49,041
What?

962
00:58:49,274 --> 00:58:50,784
We thought you were over this.

963
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,291
Kyle is real, Mom! Okay?

964
00:58:53,538 --> 00:58:55,135
He's not another Gary Wiggins!

965
00:58:57,044 --> 00:58:58,525
Of course, he's not.

966
00:59:03,557 --> 00:59:05,224
So, you broke up with Derek?

967
00:59:05,242 --> 00:59:06,765
I think we just grew apart.

968
00:59:07,091 --> 00:59:11,096
I'm extremely driven, and I want the best of
everything life has to offer, and Derek...

969
00:59:11,323 --> 00:59:13,217
well he seems to be skating backwards.

970
00:59:13,649 --> 00:59:15,733
I have over five million social media followers.

971
00:59:15,739 --> 00:59:18,138
I take more AP classes than anyone else.

972
00:59:18,434 --> 00:59:20,409
And I'm a state champion tennis player.

973
00:59:20,415 --> 00:59:23,901
I don't even like tennis, it's boring.
What about you?

974
00:59:24,001 --> 00:59:26,337
Do you want the best of
everything life has to offer?

975
00:59:27,027 --> 00:59:29,345
Yeah, yeah, I guess, I do.

976
00:59:29,729 --> 00:59:31,703
Well, you're on your way.

977
00:59:32,023 --> 00:59:37,760
You have the looks, the grades,
the popularity.

978
00:59:38,161 --> 00:59:40,824
You're just missing one detail.

979
00:59:42,077 --> 00:59:43,264
What's that?

980
00:59:45,457 --> 00:59:46,419
Me.

981
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,732
Without me, you'll be idolized.

982
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:52,266
But with me, you'll be deified.

983
00:59:53,379 --> 00:59:57,035
So, do you want me, Kyle?
Because I want you.

984
00:59:58,102 --> 01:00:04,269
Sorry. Oh, no! I totally forgot.
I gotta go, I'm so sorry.

985
01:00:05,244 --> 01:00:08,392
Our lives are made up of
seemingly simple decisions.

986
01:00:08,522 --> 01:00:13,892
This decision, right here,
right now, is one of yours.

987
01:00:14,269 --> 01:00:16,287
So you have to ask yourself...

988
01:00:17,552 --> 01:00:21,253
do you want to be a God...
or don't you?

989
01:00:44,627 --> 01:00:47,907
Dani! Dani, wait!

990
01:00:49,465 --> 01:00:50,519
Sorry.

991
01:00:50,988 --> 01:00:52,891
Hey, are you okay?

992
01:00:53,172 --> 01:00:56,047
You know, that was a really cute
picture Charlotte posted of the two of you.

993
01:00:56,053 --> 01:00:56,898
At least, I think it was you.

994
01:00:56,904 --> 01:00:59,716
You know, I couldn't quite tell, because she
was practically swallowing your face.

995
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:01,341
- I was gonna tell you, th~
- Why?

996
01:01:01,876 --> 01:01:04,959
We're just buddies.
You don't owe me anything.

997
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:10,827
I'm happy for you Kyle.
You're the new Derek.

998
01:01:12,753 --> 01:01:16,246
Hey! Hey! I'm still me.

999
01:01:17,817 --> 01:01:19,184
Are you sure about that?

1000
01:01:23,606 --> 01:01:25,690
Lonnie. Lonnie!

1001
01:01:26,024 --> 01:01:30,129
Moore! Yeah, baby, let's go!

1002
01:01:33,146 --> 01:01:35,739
Come on, now, kid!
Moore, wake up!

1003
01:01:36,056 --> 01:01:37,999
I've seen better hands on a clock!

1004
01:01:38,358 --> 01:01:40,990
Now get your head, out of your backside!

1005
01:01:42,107 --> 01:01:44,982
Skate! Oh, come on!

1006
01:01:49,894 --> 01:01:53,726
Congratulations boys,
that was the worst practice we have ever had!

1007
01:01:58,663 --> 01:02:00,629
What's up, Grimace?
Do it, Grimace.

1008
01:02:06,633 --> 01:02:08,238
- Hey.
- What do you want?

1009
01:02:09,484 --> 01:02:11,650
Look, I'm sorry I missed your party, all right?

1010
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,254
You embarrassed me.

1011
01:02:13,332 --> 01:02:16,012
- I thought we were friends.
- We are.

1012
01:02:17,082 --> 01:02:19,677
Look, you don't have to be the
person people pick on anymore.

1013
01:02:20,067 --> 01:02:23,253
- You want to go on your magic app, change me, too?
- Yes!

1014
01:02:23,882 --> 01:02:27,780
Yes, you can be whoever,
whatever, you want.

1015
01:02:28,563 --> 01:02:31,152
We can rule the school together.
We can do whatever.

1016
01:02:31,158 --> 01:02:34,471
I am who I want to be.
You're the one who changed.

1017
01:02:34,594 --> 01:02:38,284
You know what, you, and that thing,
that's a virus.

1018
01:02:39,957 --> 01:02:41,632
You've catfished yourself.

1019
01:02:56,385 --> 01:02:57,786
<i>Alden residence.</i>

1020
01:02:58,277 --> 01:03:00,509
Kyle Moore... here.

1021
01:03:28,334 --> 01:03:31,419
Hey. Oh, no, Kyle.

1022
01:03:31,444 --> 01:03:32,310
What? What's wrong?

1023
01:03:32,316 --> 01:03:33,937
You drove that old thing here?

1024
01:03:35,047 --> 01:03:36,588
Charlotte, it's a classic Alfa Romeo.

1025
01:03:36,602 --> 01:03:39,310
Hide it, and take it around the back,
and park it with the help.

1026
01:03:49,114 --> 01:03:50,302
Say something.

1027
01:03:52,118 --> 01:03:55,848
So, Mr. Alden, ah,
Charlotte tells me you're a lawyer?

1028
01:03:55,854 --> 01:03:59,130
- Where did you say you were from again, Carl?
- It's Kyle, Daddy.

1029
01:03:59,586 --> 01:04:00,573
California, sir.

1030
01:04:00,621 --> 01:04:03,504
Sun-baked hippies.
What does your father do for work?

1031
01:04:03,663 --> 01:04:05,317
He was a professional skateboarder.

1032
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:08,648
Professional... skate... boarder.

1033
01:04:08,885 --> 01:04:11,115
But now, well, he's an entrepreneur.

1034
01:04:11,129 --> 01:04:14,119
Entrepreneur,
that's a fancy word for 'unemployed'.

1035
01:04:17,955 --> 01:04:20,455
Kyle just got named captain
of the hockey team.

1036
01:04:21,048 --> 01:04:23,928
Brutish sport.
I'm going to cut to the chase.

1037
01:04:24,032 --> 01:04:25,683
You're a nice looking, young man.

1038
01:04:25,689 --> 01:04:28,935
But the truth is,
you're just not one of us.

1039
01:04:28,941 --> 01:04:30,918
Daddy, he's the most popular boy at school!

1040
01:04:30,924 --> 01:04:33,751
- It's for the best, trust me, poopy.
- Dad!

1041
01:04:33,757 --> 01:04:35,332
- Can I use the bathroom?
- Masterson...

1042
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:38,636
show the boy to the washroom,
and make sure he doesn't steal anything.

1043
01:04:40,516 --> 01:04:44,384
Now, poopy, don't pout,
you'll give yourself wrinkles.

1044
01:04:47,171 --> 01:04:48,745
Not one of you, huh?

1045
01:04:56,283 --> 01:04:58,083
Let's see what you think of me now.

1046
01:04:59,193 --> 01:05:01,120
So, how are we doin' in here?

1047
01:05:01,215 --> 01:05:04,216
Kyle! I was starting to miss you, son.
Weren't we, Pet?

1048
01:05:04,390 --> 01:05:06,233
We certainly were.

1049
01:05:07,317 --> 01:05:08,708
Daddy, are you feeling okay?

1050
01:05:08,767 --> 01:05:09,844
Never been better.

1051
01:05:09,856 --> 01:05:14,535
And Kyle, call me Dutch,
Mr. Alden sounds so stodgy.

1052
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,990
Well, Dutch, you are a bit 'stodgy'.

1053
01:05:17,361 --> 01:05:21,288
To be honest...
I don't know how Kathy puts up with you.

1054
01:05:29,988 --> 01:05:31,254
You son-of-a-gun.

1055
01:05:31,373 --> 01:05:32,785
You're terrible.

1056
01:05:32,943 --> 01:05:37,142
He's so awful, it takes me three of these,
just to get through dinner!

1057
01:05:37,341 --> 01:05:42,829
She's plowed 24/7. I'm so awful,
I can't stand to be around me!

1058
01:05:43,326 --> 01:05:45,479
Just trying to get away from myself.

1059
01:05:45,926 --> 01:05:50,357
Hey Masterson, can you stand me?
Be honest. He hates my guts!

1060
01:05:52,119 --> 01:05:53,563
I think it's time for dessert.

1061
01:05:53,615 --> 01:05:56,858
Kyle... would you give me a hand in the kitchen?

1062
01:05:57,124 --> 01:05:58,263
I'd love to.

1063
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:02,133
- Look.
- Enough of that.

1064
01:06:02,984 --> 01:06:06,054
- You're the greatest.
- Now there's a real man.

1065
01:06:08,879 --> 01:06:11,288
Mm, smells good, what's cookin' Kath?

1066
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:15,214
You and me.

1067
01:06:16,872 --> 01:06:19,351
Mrs. Alden, what are you... doing?

1068
01:06:19,479 --> 01:06:23,070
Let's run away together,
far, far away from here.

1069
01:06:23,823 --> 01:06:25,924
Uh, your husband's in the other room.

1070
01:06:25,965 --> 01:06:29,389
I love you.
You need someone more flexible.

1071
01:06:29,786 --> 01:06:31,327
I was a ballerina, you know.

1072
01:06:31,333 --> 01:06:32,583
That's great, whoa!

1073
01:06:32,667 --> 01:06:35,067
Oh, I like that game.

1074
01:06:35,407 --> 01:06:40,310
- This is out of control. This needs to stop right now.
- I'm totally out of control and I don't give a damn!

1075
01:06:41,634 --> 01:06:43,401
- Hi, Pet.
- No, no, no, stop!

1076
01:06:44,322 --> 01:06:45,112
Hey!

1077
01:06:47,765 --> 01:06:52,298
Come to me, my little pet.
Come to me!

1078
01:06:52,806 --> 01:06:55,841
- Mrs. Alden, chill!
- Just don't ever say no.

1079
01:06:55,983 --> 01:06:57,110
Stop! Stop!

1080
01:06:57,652 --> 01:07:01,830
Oh, oh, yes! Oh, baby!

1081
01:07:03,176 --> 01:07:04,544
More, what?

1082
01:07:16,039 --> 01:07:18,616
Okay. Come on,
don't do this to me, YOUniverse!

1083
01:07:18,622 --> 01:07:20,364
YOUniverse, come on, what are you doing?

1084
01:07:21,074 --> 01:07:24,417
Kyle! Come back, Kyle!

1085
01:07:27,024 --> 01:07:29,008
- Take me with you!
- Oh God!

1086
01:07:29,014 --> 01:07:30,437
Take me to Paris!

1087
01:07:30,722 --> 01:07:32,221
Oh, you didn't!

1088
01:07:32,291 --> 01:07:33,850
- Wear berets!
- Oh, goodness!

1089
01:07:33,856 --> 01:07:38,501
Frere Jacques, Frere Jacques, Dormez-vous~

1090
01:07:39,792 --> 01:07:41,425
Send me nudes!

1091
01:07:42,421 --> 01:07:45,589
Wait up, wait up, wait up, two minutes!

1092
01:07:50,531 --> 01:07:51,377
What?

1093
01:07:53,843 --> 01:07:55,569
Uh, excuse me, ma'am?

1094
01:07:55,962 --> 01:07:57,956
Excuse me, have you seen the Bearded Dude?

1095
01:07:58,080 --> 01:07:59,884
Could you be a little more specific?

1096
01:07:59,890 --> 01:08:01,645
Real weird, makes bird noises...

1097
01:08:01,702 --> 01:08:06,059
he had a kiosk, over here,
and he sold phones.

1098
01:08:06,772 --> 01:08:08,316
Are you sure you're in the right mall?

1099
01:08:08,322 --> 01:08:10,124
Because, we don't allow sales carts in here.

1100
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:12,311
Yes, I'm in the right mall.
I've seen him here twice!

1101
01:08:12,317 --> 01:08:14,584
Sir, are you under the influence?

1102
01:08:15,014 --> 01:08:17,841
I'm not even old enough to drink.
I need the YOUniverse app!

1103
01:08:20,182 --> 01:08:21,256
Sorry.

1104
01:08:43,595 --> 01:08:45,936
Maxi? What's going on?

1105
01:08:46,113 --> 01:08:47,387
They're fighting again.

1106
01:08:47,393 --> 01:08:50,594
- And I know you didn't get that job.
- It fell through.

1107
01:08:51,149 --> 01:08:55,988
I mean seriously, what do you want me to do,
put in an application at the local coffee shop?

1108
01:08:55,994 --> 01:08:59,244
Let me tell you something, that's never gonna happen,
because that ain't me, babe.

1109
01:08:59,250 --> 01:09:02,894
I did not ask you to come here,
but you came here on your own.

1110
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:05,256
I don't know why.
Do you want it to work?

1111
01:09:05,262 --> 01:09:09,116
Show me that you're trying!
You need to be responsible.

1112
01:09:09,122 --> 01:09:12,648
Don't come at me with responsibility,
you always do that.

1113
01:09:12,654 --> 01:09:14,921
Listen, I know about responsibility, all right?

1114
01:09:14,954 --> 01:09:16,601
- Oh, do you?
- Hell yes.

1115
01:09:16,638 --> 01:09:18,055
- Do you?
- Yes.

1116
01:09:18,272 --> 01:09:22,042
You know, Kyle still thinks that you
wanted him to live with you...

1117
01:09:22,433 --> 01:09:24,483
and I pulled him away from his dad...

1118
01:09:24,773 --> 01:09:28,247
and moved him across country,
because I'm a bad person.

1119
01:09:28,401 --> 01:09:32,340
And I don't dare tell him
the truth, I don't dare.

1120
01:09:34,232 --> 01:09:35,848
It would break his heart.

1121
01:09:37,209 --> 01:09:40,239
I'm sick of covering for you all the time.

1122
01:09:40,826 --> 01:09:42,793
I'm sick of being the bad person.

1123
01:09:56,336 --> 01:09:59,026
Who took a dump, in Anthony's trumpet?

1124
01:10:00,073 --> 01:10:01,229
Nobody?

1125
01:10:01,436 --> 01:10:04,525
'Cause that's what it sounded like.
So let's try that again.

1126
01:10:04,925 --> 01:10:05,855
One, two, three.

1127
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:09,973
* You took on the love and played the fool *

1128
01:10:10,267 --> 01:10:14,455
* I found there's no getting over you *

1129
01:10:14,967 --> 01:10:16,131
* All of the~ *

1130
01:10:17,669 --> 01:10:22,359
All right, the only problem I have with what
you just did, is that it sounded terrible.

1131
01:10:22,441 --> 01:10:23,370
You know what?

1132
01:10:23,423 --> 01:10:28,427
Whatever's going on between you two...
figure it out... fast!

1133
01:10:28,969 --> 01:10:30,590
All right, from the top, here we go.

1134
01:10:30,596 --> 01:10:32,483
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

1135
01:10:32,902 --> 01:10:36,158
You can't do it?
It's your song, you wrote it!

1136
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:38,559
You're gonna have to do it without me.

1137
01:10:41,516 --> 01:10:42,931
Wait!

1138
01:10:44,977 --> 01:10:47,175
You shouldn't quit... I should.

1139
01:10:47,615 --> 01:10:52,664
No no no, actually, you shouldn't quit either.
Neither should~ Stop quitting! Everybody stop quitting!

1140
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:55,883
The Slam is in five days,
you can not quit, Kyle.

1141
01:10:56,945 --> 01:10:57,971
I just did.

1142
01:11:17,687 --> 01:11:24,082
<i>All right, let's make some noise, for coach Milligan,
and our undefeated, hot hockey team!</i>

1143
01:11:25,687 --> 01:11:31,374
Thank you. Thanks.
We came in second place last year.

1144
01:11:31,607 --> 01:11:33,055
One point shy...

1145
01:11:33,195 --> 01:11:38,342
of our first trip to the state championship in 20 long,
agonizing years.

1146
01:11:38,467 --> 01:11:42,395
The last 365 days have been,
very tough, on coach.

1147
01:11:42,513 --> 01:11:46,163
I shed a lot of tears.
My wife and dog left me.

1148
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:49,338
I woke up one morning,
naked in a chicken coop.

1149
01:11:49,443 --> 01:11:52,858
And I, might, have killed a man.

1150
01:11:52,901 --> 01:11:55,424
And... ah but...

1151
01:11:55,627 --> 01:11:59,168
that is all in the past, because, tomorrow night...

1152
01:11:59,416 --> 01:12:02,084
we get our first shot at redemption. Yes!

1153
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:08,485
The reign of the Bulldogs is over!

1154
01:12:08,737 --> 01:12:11,809
This is the year of the Hawks!

1155
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:19,284
I would like to hand the stage over,
to the captain of our team...

1156
01:12:19,433 --> 01:12:21,988
and the man who is
gonna lead us all the way...

1157
01:12:22,061 --> 01:12:26,181
to the Connecticut Cup, Kyle Moore!

1158
01:12:36,307 --> 01:12:38,608
Wow thanks, thanks so much, ah.

1159
01:12:39,553 --> 01:12:42,233
It's been a fast and furious
ride ever since I got here.

1160
01:12:42,407 --> 01:12:45,441
Don't you mean fast and fraudulent ride?

1161
01:12:57,124 --> 01:12:59,445
He's got you all believing, he's a singer...

1162
01:13:00,554 --> 01:13:03,751
and a hockey player... and worst of all...

1163
01:13:05,197 --> 01:13:06,970
a heterosexual.

1164
01:13:07,537 --> 01:13:09,427
But he's none of these things.

1165
01:13:11,130 --> 01:13:14,418
Not without, his magic, app!

1166
01:13:15,194 --> 01:13:17,713
He's got a magic app, on his phone...

1167
01:13:17,869 --> 01:13:21,745
that allows him to be,
whoever, and whatever, he wants!

1168
01:13:22,411 --> 01:13:25,834
This boy you all worship, is a lie!

1169
01:13:27,847 --> 01:13:29,031
You're an idiot!

1170
01:13:29,688 --> 01:13:30,943
Boo!

1171
01:13:31,430 --> 01:13:33,949
It's the truth! I'm telling you!

1172
01:13:33,978 --> 01:13:36,048
Did you hear me? It's a magic app!

1173
01:13:36,268 --> 01:13:41,332
- All right, come on, let's go, buddy.
- He's a nobody! He's a... nobody!

1174
01:13:42,943 --> 01:13:44,545
Wait, wait!

1175
01:13:45,607 --> 01:13:48,159
Hold on I...
I gotta be honest about some things.

1176
01:13:48,271 --> 01:13:51,657
It's true, four or five weeks ago,
I'd never played a game of hockey in my life.

1177
01:13:52,141 --> 01:13:54,113
I never ice skated,
I've never even held a stick.

1178
01:13:54,119 --> 01:13:55,866
He's like the Roy Hobbs of hockey!

1179
01:13:55,907 --> 01:13:58,836
No, listen to me.
I don't deserve any of this attention, I'm a~

1180
01:13:58,842 --> 01:14:01,651
An incredibly modest superstar!

1181
01:14:01,657 --> 01:14:05,203
No! I'm trying to tell you! I'm a fake, a phony!
I don't even know who I am.

1182
01:14:05,209 --> 01:14:07,188
A role model to everyone here tonight.

1183
01:14:07,194 --> 01:14:07,884
Exactly!

1184
01:14:07,890 --> 01:14:10,740
Unless we lose to the Bulldogs,
and then he's dead to everyone of us.

1185
01:14:10,746 --> 01:14:13,582
Let's light this fire!

1186
01:14:25,531 --> 01:14:26,739
Kyle?

1187
01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:33,062
Dani... Dani, wait, please.

1188
01:14:33,068 --> 01:14:35,985
What do you want from me, Kyle?
You have everything.

1189
01:14:35,992 --> 01:14:38,702
You have the fame, the glory.
You even have the girl.

1190
01:14:38,708 --> 01:14:40,310
What more could you possibly want?

1191
01:14:40,316 --> 01:14:41,594
I don't want any of it.

1192
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:44,872
This, these clothes,
this isn't me, you know that.

1193
01:14:44,957 --> 01:14:49,395
If I could take it all back right now...
if I could erase everything, I would.

1194
01:14:49,465 --> 01:14:52,069
- Okay, then why don't you?
- Because I, I can't.

1195
01:14:53,296 --> 01:14:54,381
You can't?

1196
01:14:56,801 --> 01:15:01,539
Look... everything Brian said, was true.

1197
01:15:01,873 --> 01:15:05,318
There's this app, and everything I wish for comes true.
And I wished that I could sing,

1198
01:15:05,324 --> 01:15:09,025
so I could get close to you, and then it happened,
and then, so did everything else, and~

1199
01:15:09,727 --> 01:15:12,345
I wanna take it all back Dani,
but there's nothing I can do.

1200
01:15:14,341 --> 01:15:15,941
Let me just get this straight.

1201
01:15:16,873 --> 01:15:19,043
You've been a jerk,
because of an app?

1202
01:15:20,167 --> 01:15:23,502
- I know it sounds crazy.
- You know what's even crazier?

1203
01:15:25,028 --> 01:15:28,643
I wrote Drowning,
the day after you took me on the Ferris wheel.

1204
01:15:50,114 --> 01:15:51,911
Hey, can I have your autograph?

1205
01:15:52,065 --> 01:15:53,585
It's been a really long~

1206
01:15:57,305 --> 01:15:59,028
Turn down for what!?

1207
01:16:18,102 --> 01:16:19,234
You ready to get up?

1208
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:20,660
I'm not going to school today.

1209
01:16:20,666 --> 01:16:21,977
What now?

1210
01:16:25,164 --> 01:16:26,698
I just don't want to go.

1211
01:16:26,910 --> 01:16:28,808
Well, that's not really a reason.

1212
01:16:28,814 --> 01:16:31,018
You have to convince me
to let you stay home.

1213
01:16:31,024 --> 01:16:33,527
What is it?
What's going on with you?

1214
01:16:38,559 --> 01:16:42,912
I posted some things on social media,
and I've hurt people.

1215
01:16:43,881 --> 01:16:45,567
And it all keeps getting worse, and...

1216
01:16:47,028 --> 01:16:48,489
I've really messed up.

1217
01:16:52,339 --> 01:16:57,416
Okay, well... when you mess up.
And you're gonna mess up.

1218
01:16:58,090 --> 01:17:00,725
The only thing you can do
is take ownership of it...

1219
01:17:00,858 --> 01:17:03,321
and try to make it right.
That's it.

1220
01:17:03,626 --> 01:17:05,276
It's like ripping off a Band-aid.

1221
01:17:05,282 --> 01:17:08,464
It's gonna hurt,
but just do it, and it's done.

1222
01:17:08,678 --> 01:17:13,339
And look, social media,
that stuff isn't real, you know that.

1223
01:17:13,731 --> 01:17:15,966
It's just everybody's highlight reel of...

1224
01:17:16,388 --> 01:17:19,345
the stuff they want you to see.
It's all bullshit.

1225
01:17:19,462 --> 01:17:22,805
It's bullshit with a filter on it,
to make it look pretty.

1226
01:17:23,162 --> 01:17:26,052
Let's eat. Get up!

1227
01:17:26,844 --> 01:17:27,963
Hey, Mom...

1228
01:17:30,268 --> 01:17:32,401
you look really pretty today.

1229
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:34,362
Thank you...

1230
01:17:35,206 --> 01:17:37,105
but you still have to go to school.

1231
01:17:43,090 --> 01:17:45,357
Good morning, family, huh?

1232
01:17:45,957 --> 01:17:48,844
- What's for breakfast? I'm starving.
- French toast.

1233
01:17:48,850 --> 01:17:50,875
French toast, sounds good.

1234
01:17:50,990 --> 01:17:53,403
Hey, you know what? You and I
ought to go down to the park,

1235
01:17:53,409 --> 01:17:57,092
- and do some skating today, that's what we should do.
- Well, how's that job going, Dad?

1236
01:17:58,282 --> 01:18:01,153
Wow, right out of the gates, huh? Just~

1237
01:18:01,724 --> 01:18:06,190
Well, if you gotta know, um...
that one didn't pan out.

1238
01:18:06,624 --> 01:18:09,090
I gotta lot of good leads though,
so don't sweat it.

1239
01:18:09,096 --> 01:18:12,649
More importantly, do we got any powdered sugar
to go with that French toast?

1240
01:18:12,874 --> 01:18:15,674
Only Annie knows the answer.
Annie, talk to me!

1241
01:18:15,931 --> 01:18:17,611
Powdered sugar!

1242
01:18:17,617 --> 01:18:20,151
Wait mom, sit down.

1243
01:18:22,704 --> 01:18:24,982
You okay, killer? You're acting a little weird.

1244
01:18:25,161 --> 01:18:26,092
I'm fine.

1245
01:18:26,629 --> 01:18:29,370
But Mom's not getting your
breakfast today, or any other day.

1246
01:18:29,472 --> 01:18:31,681
The free ride stops, right now.

1247
01:18:32,889 --> 01:18:34,923
What are you~
What are you talkin' about?

1248
01:18:34,929 --> 01:18:36,230
What's going on here?
Did I miss something?

1249
01:18:36,236 --> 01:18:37,191
- Did you say something to him?
- Darryl.

1250
01:18:37,197 --> 01:18:38,351
Clearly you said something
to him, he's all worked up.

1251
01:18:38,357 --> 01:18:39,364
Leave her out of this.
I didn't say anything.

1252
01:18:39,370 --> 01:18:40,999
- This is about you and me.
- Is it?

1253
01:18:41,053 --> 01:18:42,526
- Yeah.
- All right.

1254
01:18:43,359 --> 01:18:45,283
Well, what is it about you and me?

1255
01:18:51,406 --> 01:18:53,307
When Mom moved me away from you...

1256
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:58,237
I was so angry... and hurt, and alone.

1257
01:18:59,430 --> 01:19:02,362
She took me away from my best friend, my hero.

1258
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:08,870
I would have done... anything...
for you to come back in my life.

1259
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:10,956
But, the truth is...

1260
01:19:12,863 --> 01:19:14,558
you didn't even want me.

1261
01:19:15,867 --> 01:19:17,750
You didn't even want me.

1262
01:19:18,656 --> 01:19:22,447
I was so wrong, and I made Mom
go through hell because of it.

1263
01:19:22,943 --> 01:19:26,025
But Mom, Maxi, and I,
we deserve somebody...

1264
01:19:26,292 --> 01:19:29,934
who wants to be with us...
and you deserve to live your life.

1265
01:19:30,419 --> 01:19:31,998
As hard as that is...

1266
01:19:33,334 --> 01:19:34,577
I get it now.

1267
01:19:36,519 --> 01:19:39,122
Maxi? You feel the same way?

1268
01:19:43,489 --> 01:19:46,100
Grampa, I know how you feel.
All right.

1269
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:53,618
I guess you're the man of the house,
congratulations.

1270
01:19:54,312 --> 01:19:56,418
I'm gonna go get my breakfast elsewhere.

1271
01:20:08,201 --> 01:20:10,725
- Xing-fu, hey.
- Hey.

1272
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:13,015
How goes it now, Xing-fu.

1273
01:20:14,038 --> 01:20:15,488
Hey, Kyle...

1274
01:20:17,930 --> 01:20:20,842
I'm sorry, for being such a lousy little sister.

1275
01:20:21,978 --> 01:20:23,545
I could do a lot worse.

1276
01:20:44,825 --> 01:20:47,128
- Hi, Mr. Gregory?
- Yes?

1277
01:20:47,352 --> 01:20:48,461
I'm Kyle Moore.

1278
01:20:48,929 --> 01:20:51,543
I just wanted to drop by and say hello,
I'm Lonnie's friend.

1279
01:20:52,910 --> 01:20:56,379
Good God in heaven, you're real.

1280
01:20:56,764 --> 01:20:59,124
Honey! Honey! Come quick!

1281
01:20:59,232 --> 01:21:00,242
What is it?

1282
01:21:00,654 --> 01:21:03,706
This is Kyle, Lonnie's friend!

1283
01:21:04,758 --> 01:21:07,550
Did he put you up to this?
Is he paying you?

1284
01:21:07,597 --> 01:21:10,320
No, Lonnie's really my friend.

1285
01:21:11,861 --> 01:21:14,195
To be honest he's, actually my best friend.

1286
01:21:26,081 --> 01:21:27,449
Hey, Lonnie.

1287
01:21:31,061 --> 01:21:33,880
- I gotta go, but it was great meeting you guys.
- The pleasure's ours.

1288
01:21:33,886 --> 01:21:37,157
Come back again! Soon! Please!

1289
01:21:38,464 --> 01:21:39,739
Lonnie!

1290
01:21:41,935 --> 01:21:43,255
Wait up, man!

1291
01:21:43,385 --> 01:21:44,857
Leave me alone, Kyle.

1292
01:21:45,148 --> 01:21:47,568
Hey, don't push off with yourfront foot,
that's mongo.

1293
01:21:47,574 --> 01:21:49,098
Don't tell me what to do.

1294
01:21:50,679 --> 01:21:52,045
Hey, so get this...

1295
01:21:52,543 --> 01:21:56,293
I met this guy in Cleveland,
says he's a bikini model named Phil.

1296
01:21:59,275 --> 01:22:01,146
You're lucky you're my only friend.

1297
01:22:03,430 --> 01:22:04,690
I'm back, buddy.

1298
01:22:19,476 --> 01:22:21,643
Kyle? Kyle! What are you doing?

1299
01:22:25,938 --> 01:22:28,286
If it isn't the prince of popularity.

1300
01:22:28,899 --> 01:22:31,138
What are you doing over here with us lepers?

1301
01:22:31,825 --> 01:22:33,099
You don't look so good, bud.

1302
01:22:33,105 --> 01:22:36,782
Well, let's see, I lost my girl,
I lost my scholarships.

1303
01:22:36,788 --> 01:22:38,110
Coach demoted me to fourth line.

1304
01:22:38,116 --> 01:22:39,897
My friends want nothing to do with me...

1305
01:22:39,903 --> 01:22:44,705
and now my dad's talking about sending me to military
school. So yeah, life's great, I'm doing fantastic.

1306
01:22:46,316 --> 01:22:47,584
You got something on your face.

1307
01:22:47,590 --> 01:22:48,633
I don't care.

1308
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:51,233
What is Kyle doing with that loser?

1309
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:53,167
- So gross.
- I can't believe I dated him.

1310
01:22:53,253 --> 01:22:54,844
Oh, I can't believe I slept~

1311
01:22:57,352 --> 01:23:00,616
I mean, through third period.

1312
01:23:02,367 --> 01:23:03,596
LOL.

1313
01:23:03,876 --> 01:23:08,121
Come on, Derek, where's that clean cut,
confident guy, that I hated a few months ago?

1314
01:23:08,228 --> 01:23:10,231
He's you now. I gotta go.

1315
01:23:10,408 --> 01:23:11,768
Wait, wait, wait.

1316
01:23:13,362 --> 01:23:17,853
Look, man, this isn't me.
I don't want to be this guy.

1317
01:23:18,508 --> 01:23:22,134
- I want to help you get on top again.
- I don't know what your game is, all right,

1318
01:23:22,212 --> 01:23:24,980
but if you're looking to bury me some more,
give it your best shot.

1319
01:23:24,986 --> 01:23:26,392
There's no angle here.

1320
01:23:27,611 --> 01:23:29,111
I just want to make things right.

1321
01:23:32,029 --> 01:23:35,890
* I thought you'd be mine and it felt so good *

1322
01:23:36,172 --> 01:23:40,199
* One look in your eyes and I swear I knew *

1323
01:23:41,110 --> 01:23:43,977
* Love your kiss, your touch, your~ *

1324
01:23:44,876 --> 01:23:47,267
Hold on, everybody. Hold on, thank you.

1325
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,736
Dani... what's the matter honey, talk to me.

1326
01:23:52,281 --> 01:23:53,647
I'm so sorry.

1327
01:23:54,134 --> 01:23:57,458
I'm sorry, it's the song,
it was written as a duet.

1328
01:23:58,697 --> 01:24:00,174
I don't think I can sing it.

1329
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:03,411
It's beautiful, and you sing it so well.

1330
01:24:03,417 --> 01:24:05,260
It just doesn't feel right anymore.

1331
01:24:05,565 --> 01:24:11,569
Is there any way we could go
back to Hallelujah... please?

1332
01:24:15,115 --> 01:24:19,176
Oh, my God, these girls, with their boy problems.

1333
01:24:20,768 --> 01:24:23,769
Okay, everybody, Hallelujah, from the top.

1334
01:24:23,951 --> 01:24:25,525
All right, you remember how that goes.

1335
01:24:25,531 --> 01:24:29,343
Horns, you want to get your spittle out now,
so we don't have to watch that later?

1336
01:24:29,755 --> 01:24:30,874
Here we go.

1337
01:24:35,774 --> 01:24:40,798
Whoa... Charlotte, hey,
didn't see you stalk~ standing there.

1338
01:24:41,150 --> 01:24:42,275
Hmm.

1339
01:24:43,533 --> 01:24:45,133
Have you been ignoring me?

1340
01:24:45,378 --> 01:24:47,340
No, why would I be ignoring you?
No, I just~

1341
01:24:47,346 --> 01:24:50,149
You've been ignoring my texts,
you've been ignoring me at lunch.

1342
01:24:50,266 --> 01:24:51,945
You ignored me at the bonfire.

1343
01:24:52,712 --> 01:24:54,282
I will not be ignored, Kyle.

1344
01:24:54,325 --> 01:24:55,926
- Shh!
- Shut up!

1345
01:24:56,159 --> 01:24:57,692
I will eat your children!

1346
01:24:57,968 --> 01:24:59,062
Okay.

1347
01:25:01,228 --> 01:25:05,209
I don't want to fight you.
I just want to love you.

1348
01:25:13,389 --> 01:25:14,983
I love you so much.

1349
01:25:15,796 --> 01:25:17,889
We're gonna be together forever.

1350
01:25:18,774 --> 01:25:20,456
Good luck at the game tonight.

1351
01:25:20,991 --> 01:25:25,461
I'll be watching, every, little, step.

1352
01:25:27,799 --> 01:25:28,898
Oh, my God.

1353
01:25:31,656 --> 01:25:35,658
Let's go Hawks! Let's go Hawks!

1354
01:25:40,253 --> 01:25:42,097
<i>* Play to win *</i>

1355
01:25:43,145 --> 01:25:45,795
<i>* We got all this to lose *</i>

1356
01:25:46,814 --> 01:25:51,595

1360

01:26:11,752 --> 01:26:13,080

1362

<i>your very own, number 17, Kyle Moore!</i>

1368
01:26:53,774 --> 01:26:55,874
How many goals you got in you tonight,
super star?

1369
01:26:55,900 --> 01:26:57,178
More than they do.

1370
01:26:57,424 --> 01:27:00,392
That's my boy!
Go out there and take the face off!

1371
01:27:02,105 --> 01:27:07,542
Come on, now.
That's my boy, Kyle. You are, my boy!

1372
01:27:07,548 --> 01:27:10,103
All right now,
let's play as a team! Okay.

1373
01:27:13,293 --> 01:27:15,215
Yeah, boys, let's go, boys!

1374
01:27:15,221 --> 01:27:17,188
Let's win this face-off, let's go!

1375
01:27:27,166 --> 01:27:31,265
Hey, Moore, I got your number tonight.
I'm gonna light you up.

1376
01:27:31,999 --> 01:27:33,707
Let's see what you got?

1377
01:27:37,329 --> 01:27:39,718
That's my best friend, right there.

1378
01:27:40,755 --> 01:27:43,535
- I love you!
- I love you, too!

1379
01:27:49,538 --> 01:27:51,204
Up! Up!

1380
01:27:56,107 --> 01:27:57,372
Look for the opening!

1381
01:27:58,763 --> 01:28:00,062
Nice.

1382
01:28:03,855 --> 01:28:07,390
Nice move! Move it up,
up the ice, up the ice.

1383
01:28:13,637 --> 01:28:14,836
No!

1384
01:28:19,237 --> 01:28:20,302
What the~

1385
01:28:24,546 --> 01:28:27,242
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1386
01:28:27,335 --> 01:28:32,365
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

1387
01:28:32,506 --> 01:28:33,697
Yo, kid, where does it hurt?

1388
01:28:33,703 --> 01:28:36,635
- It hurts right there where you're touching it, ow.
- Sorry, my bad.

1389
01:28:36,641 --> 01:28:39,414
Listen, look at me!
I'm gonna tell you a story.

1390
01:28:39,532 --> 01:28:43,172
I once played with a broken
back, a broken pubis...

1391
01:28:43,194 --> 01:28:45,761
a broken leg, an infected urethra...

1392
01:28:45,793 --> 01:28:48,061
and one hell of an epic hangover!

1393
01:28:48,130 --> 01:28:52,876
So you are gonna be fine!
Now help him up! Jeez!

1394
01:28:56,067 --> 01:28:59,549
Okay, he's good. He's okay!

1395
01:29:01,733 --> 01:29:03,536
I can't do it, Coach.
I can't do it.

1396
01:29:03,542 --> 01:29:04,832
So that's a no? Or~

1397
01:29:04,838 --> 01:29:06,473
Don't make me do it, Coach.

1398
01:29:08,265 --> 01:29:09,698
Get him off the ice.

1399
01:29:14,716 --> 01:29:17,665
Why, God, why?

1400
01:29:23,132 --> 01:29:24,643
Back to the chicken coop.

1401
01:29:24,980 --> 01:29:26,170
- Coach!
- What?

1402
01:29:26,282 --> 01:29:27,342
Put me in.

1403
01:29:28,487 --> 01:29:29,453
- Coach.
- What?

1404
01:29:29,459 --> 01:29:30,962
- Stop crying.
- I'm not crying.

1405
01:29:30,968 --> 01:29:33,035
Stop it. I'm gonna win this game for us.

1406
01:29:33,574 --> 01:29:34,682
- Coach!
- Yeah.

1407
01:29:34,801 --> 01:29:36,073
Listen to me, put me in.

1408
01:29:36,354 --> 01:29:37,272
- Okay.
- Now.

1409
01:29:37,278 --> 01:29:41,188
Okay, you're in.
Go get him, kid! Go get him, kid!

1410
01:29:51,647 --> 01:29:53,205
Get back out there, guys.

1411
01:29:55,049 --> 01:29:56,440
I'll find you a doctor.

1412
01:29:58,564 --> 01:30:01,709
That was awesome. You totally deserve an Oscar.
Have you thought about acting?

1413
01:30:01,715 --> 01:30:02,780
I wasn't acting.

1414
01:30:02,786 --> 01:30:04,428
- Oh, sorry, dude.
- So, we gotta go.

1415
01:30:04,434 --> 01:30:06,212
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Text my sister.

1416
01:30:06,218 --> 01:30:08,500
- Have everyone meet us at the Slam.
- Okay.

1417
01:30:09,565 --> 01:30:12,372
- Dude, why'd you park there?
- It's super cool!

1418
01:30:18,298 --> 01:30:19,919
- I'm good.
- What are you doing?

1419
01:30:19,925 --> 01:30:21,558
Just got excited.

1420
01:30:21,564 --> 01:30:27,117
* Crimson and clover, over and over *

1421
01:30:27,229 --> 01:30:33,313
* Crimson and clover, over and over *

1422
01:30:43,275 --> 01:30:44,464
Nice, Lonnie.

1423
01:30:45,726 --> 01:30:48,530
Speed Racer. Wait! Wait up!

1424
01:30:52,615 --> 01:30:54,732
You'll have to get through me first.

1425
01:30:56,608 --> 01:30:59,502
The Cutler High School band and chorus.

1426
01:31:00,286 --> 01:31:02,254
All right, this is your big moment.

1427
01:31:02,350 --> 01:31:05,885
If you go out there and do what
you can do, you will fail...

1428
01:31:05,943 --> 01:31:09,164
because you're not ready
and you're not talented.

1429
01:31:09,197 --> 01:31:12,761
I am so nervous, I'm sweating
like a wino in a liquor store.

1430
01:31:12,767 --> 01:31:15,682
We're all gonna die. I have gas.
Is there a toilet~

1431
01:31:15,688 --> 01:31:18,159
- Mr. Moody!
- Oh, hello!

1432
01:31:18,937 --> 01:31:22,169
When are you gonna get the message,
to stay away from my girl?

1433
01:31:25,654 --> 01:31:27,162
Brian you're gay...

1434
01:31:27,615 --> 01:31:29,897
and that's okay, just be yourself.

1435
01:31:40,147 --> 01:31:41,249
Whoa!

1436
01:31:41,450 --> 01:31:42,684
What, too soon?

1437
01:31:43,432 --> 01:31:45,919
But, I~ Okay.

1438
01:31:50,596 --> 01:31:52,084
- You're gonna need this.
- Thank you.

1439
01:31:52,090 --> 01:31:54,575
All right, go get 'em, man.

1440
01:31:55,900 --> 01:32:00,670
<i>Ladies and gentleman, next up,
our very own Hayden Hawks!</i>

1441
01:32:01,841 --> 01:32:05,454
Okay, kids, talent does what it can,
genius does what it must.

1442
01:32:05,574 --> 01:32:08,394
But you do what no one else wants to do.

1443
01:32:08,574 --> 01:32:11,840
Go out there, and stick to your guns,
even though they're not loaded.

1444
01:32:11,846 --> 01:32:14,042
And remember, Mr. Pookins is
listening from heaven.

1445
01:32:14,048 --> 01:32:16,813
So a big meow for him.
Meow... but not too loud.

1446
01:32:17,097 --> 01:32:19,067
Meow.

1447
01:32:19,097 --> 01:32:20,535
Let's go, come on.

1448
01:32:38,070 --> 01:32:41,607
* Now I've heard there was a secret chord *

1449
01:32:41,789 --> 01:32:45,222
* That David played and pleased the Lord *

1450
01:32:45,562 --> 01:32:51,081
* But you don't really care for music do you *

1451
01:33:03,093 --> 01:33:05,613
* The ocean is heavy *

1452
01:33:07,238 --> 01:33:09,293
* Your current is strong *

1453
01:33:09,558 --> 01:33:11,134
Drowning, Drowning!

1454
01:33:11,354 --> 01:33:13,490
* You're pulling me deeper *

1455
01:33:13,674 --> 01:33:14,779
Come on.

1456
01:33:15,512 --> 01:33:17,748
* Been here all along *

1457
01:33:19,651 --> 01:33:23,549
* Remember the time I first saw you *

1458
01:33:23,822 --> 01:33:27,678
* I thought you'd be mine and it felt so good *

1459
01:33:27,946 --> 01:33:31,839
* One look in your eyes and I swear I knew *

1460
01:33:32,712 --> 01:33:36,052
* Of your kiss, your touch, your love *

1461
01:33:36,162 --> 01:33:38,550
* And I can't breathe *

1462
01:33:40,309 --> 01:33:44,071
* I'm struggling *

1463
01:33:44,471 --> 01:33:47,420
* My heart's at ease *

1464
01:33:49,165 --> 01:33:51,134
* 'Cause I'm drowning *

1465
01:33:51,251 --> 01:33:54,749
* 'Cause I'm drowning in your love *

1466
01:33:56,863 --> 01:34:00,769
* It seems like the love songs have got it all wrong *

1467
01:34:01,002 --> 01:34:02,774
* I thought I would fly *

1468
01:34:02,871 --> 01:34:04,933
* No flying no flying *

1469
01:34:05,366 --> 01:34:09,082
* And it's getting darker the further we fall *

1470
01:34:09,277 --> 01:34:13,164
* And I'm feeling high, So high so high *

1471
01:34:13,461 --> 01:34:17,350
* I took on the lies and played the fool *

1472
01:34:17,586 --> 01:34:21,491
* I found there's no getting over you *

1473
01:34:21,734 --> 01:34:25,625
* And all of this time I never knew *

1474
01:34:26,629 --> 01:34:29,800
* Of your kiss, your touch, your love *

1475
01:34:29,958 --> 01:34:32,388
* And I can't breathe *

1476
01:34:34,051 --> 01:34:38,021
* I'm struggling *

1477
01:34:38,262 --> 01:34:41,123
* My mind's at ease *

1478
01:34:42,892 --> 01:34:44,874
* 'Cause I'm drowning *

1479
01:34:44,991 --> 01:34:48,859
* 'Cause I'm drowning in your love *

1480
01:34:51,100 --> 01:34:53,742
* Oh don't you break my heart now *

1481
01:34:53,838 --> 01:34:55,820
* Don't leave me wanting more *

1482
01:34:56,125 --> 01:34:59,762
* Give me love, give me someone to hold *

1483
01:35:00,095 --> 01:35:03,733
* Messing with the stars, It indeed is very far *

1484
01:35:03,858 --> 01:35:07,562
* Oh no. Oh no *

1485
01:35:07,759 --> 01:35:12,189
* I'll never break your heart,
You're one good looking boy *

1486
01:35:12,673 --> 01:35:16,084
* All I need, is you forever more *

1487
01:35:16,578 --> 01:35:20,242
* Messing with the stars, It indeed is very far *

1488
01:35:20,432 --> 01:35:23,653
* Oh no. Oh no *

1489
01:35:23,771 --> 01:35:25,950
* And I can't breathe *

1490
01:35:27,894 --> 01:35:31,814
* I'm struggling *

1491
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:34,845
* My heart's at ease *

1492
01:35:36,734 --> 01:35:38,555
* 'Cause I'm drowning *

1493
01:35:38,797 --> 01:35:42,432
* 'Cause I'm drowning in your love *

1494
01:35:45,567 --> 01:35:47,255
* Love *

1495
01:35:47,829 --> 01:35:49,623
* Drowning in your *

1496
01:35:49,671 --> 01:35:53,666
* Drowning drowning
drowning drowning *

1497
01:35:53,797 --> 01:35:56,641
* Drowning in your love *

1498
01:35:56,930 --> 01:35:59,267
* In your love *

1499
01:36:01,293 --> 01:36:03,862
* Messin with the stars *

1500
01:36:04,112 --> 01:36:07,655
* Drowning in your love *

1501
01:36:12,291 --> 01:36:15,292
Thank you, Mr. Pookins. Meow.

1502
01:36:18,023 --> 01:36:19,722
Yeah!

1503
01:36:20,255 --> 01:36:21,568
What are you doing here?

1504
01:36:21,862 --> 01:36:27,517
Dani, I know I hurt you.
I was an idiot, I'm sorry.

1505
01:36:28,370 --> 01:36:29,910
Can you forgive me?

1506
01:36:35,846 --> 01:36:38,380
Hey, take a bow!

1507
01:37:16,278 --> 01:37:17,757
I got my life back!

1508
01:37:19,410 --> 01:37:21,443
Dani, I got my life back!

1509
01:37:34,912 --> 01:37:36,945
That was so good!

1510
01:37:38,423 --> 01:37:39,922
Thanks.

1511
01:37:43,766 --> 01:37:48,090
Kyle? You're about as authentic
as a Mexican Prada handbag.

1512
01:37:48,193 --> 01:37:51,961
So this, we're done, okay?
Have a good life.

1513
01:37:53,078 --> 01:37:56,056
- Kyle!
- Hey!

1514
01:37:57,091 --> 01:38:00,151
- That was amazing, oh, my God.
- You killed it.

1515
01:38:00,157 --> 01:38:01,802
- Thanks, Mom.
- I cried, I cried.

1516
01:38:01,818 --> 01:38:04,690
That was pretty dope, dude.
I helped him so, he's my best friend.

1517
01:38:04,696 --> 01:38:06,542
- Wow.
- What's Dad doing here?

1518
01:38:08,085 --> 01:38:10,852
Um... he just wants to say goodbye.

1519
01:38:11,659 --> 01:38:13,314
- Oh.
- Go on.

1520
01:38:15,529 --> 01:38:16,705
I'm here.

1521
01:38:21,090 --> 01:38:22,168
Hey, killer.

1522
01:38:22,495 --> 01:38:23,484
Hey.

1523
01:38:23,625 --> 01:38:26,443
That was some performance in there, Holy cow!

1524
01:38:26,873 --> 01:38:27,532
Thanks.

1525
01:38:27,611 --> 01:38:28,884
So um...

1526
01:38:29,501 --> 01:38:31,487
look, I think I'm gonna hit the road.

1527
01:38:32,427 --> 01:38:34,461
I just think it's the best thing for everyone.

1528
01:38:37,340 --> 01:38:38,565
Take care of 'em.

1529
01:38:40,591 --> 01:38:41,891
I will.

1530
01:38:48,827 --> 01:38:50,457
If you ever need anything~

1531
01:38:50,730 --> 01:38:51,921
I know, Dad.

1532
01:39:24,261 --> 01:39:25,386
You okay?

1533
01:39:26,594 --> 01:39:27,876
How could I not be?

1534
01:39:27,887 --> 01:39:31,839

Hi, sorry to bother you,
if it's not too much trouble...

1569
01:42:28,020 --> 01:42:33,115
would you be able to fix my, phone?
It doesn't um... work.

1570
01:42:34,871 --> 01:42:36,160
You want to go to Vegas?

1571
01:42:36,171 --> 01:42:39,117
Uh, I should call my wife.

1572
01:42:39,166 --> 01:42:40,527
Yeah, your phone's broken.

1573
01:42:41,351 --> 01:42:42,208
Ha.
