00:35:30,195 --> 00:35:32,625
because nothing beats
New England falls.

622
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,630
Have you ever heard of the
Heavenly Pursuit?

623
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,395
What's that?

624
00:35:38,403 --> 00:35:41,873
Okay, well, autumn is the time
of year that the moon...

625
00:35:41,874 --> 00:35:45,244
after pursuing the sun since
spring, finally catches up...

626
00:35:45,244 --> 00:35:48,384
to her, but then he out
distances her...

627
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:51,310
and the whole pursuit begins
again.

628
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,276
It's kind of like two lovers
who lose one another.

629
00:35:54,286 --> 00:35:57,216
But his love is so powerful...

630
00:35:57,222 --> 00:36:01,392
that he spends his entire life
trying to find her.

631
00:36:01,393 --> 00:36:03,263
That sounds kinda tragic.

632
00:36:03,262 --> 00:36:09,772
Yeah, I know, I'm a total sucker
for a tragic love story.

633
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:12,338
But I think every girl
wants a moon.

634
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:15,539
Yeah.

635
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:27,952
This has been the coolest night.

636
00:36:27,953 --> 00:36:29,623
Yeah.

637
00:36:35,894 --> 00:36:37,764
I don't get it.

638
00:36:37,763 --> 00:36:39,663
I've lived here my whole life
and no one even knows who I am.

639
00:36:39,665 --> 00:36:40,955
Come on, that's not true.

640
00:36:40,966 --> 00:36:42,726
Hi, Liza.
Who are you?

641
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:45,274
Lonnie Gregory, your next door
neighbor for the past 17 years.

642
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:47,200
Doesn't ring a bell. Sorry.

643
00:36:47,206 --> 00:36:49,936
Course not, hey, thanks for not
inviting me to your Sweet 16.

644
00:36:49,942 --> 00:36:52,882
It was beautiful from what I saw
from the window anyways.

645
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:54,378
But that's what I mean, you.

646
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:55,979
You show up four weeks ago...

647
00:36:55,981 --> 00:36:59,351
and now your life is like this
amazing fairy tale, right?

648
00:36:59,351 --> 00:37:00,981
I keep thinking about it...

649
00:37:00,986 --> 00:37:04,216
it's a little annoying,
actually, but in a good way.

650
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:06,463
Okay, Lonnie, I have to tell
you something.

651
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:09,588
But you gotta promise me that
you won't tell anyone. Promise?

652
00:37:09,595 --> 00:37:12,255
Yeah, not even Mom.
You sure? You talk a lot.

653
00:37:12,264 --> 00:37:13,664
I know I talk a lot,
just tell me.

654
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:16,425
Okay, okay, I have a magic app
on my phone...

655
00:37:16,435 --> 00:37:19,395
and whatever I post on it...
comes true.

656
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:24,610
I'm sorry, what? What?
It's insane.

657
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:27,640
Oh my god, I have the same app,
I thought I was the only one.

658
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:29,406
[KYLE] Really?
Yeah, no, dude!

659
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:30,984
Come on, you lost your mind.
Lonnie, I'm telling the truth.

660
00:37:30,983 --> 00:37:32,723
Okay, fine, if that was even
a possibility...

661
00:37:32,718 --> 00:37:35,248
which I'm not saying that it is,
how would that even work?

662
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:38,494
I'll tell you, okay,
so my phone broke...

663
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:39,760
so I took it to the mall
to this bearded dude.

664
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:40,988
Bearded dude?
Bearded dude.

665
00:37:40,993 --> 00:37:42,563
He gave me a new phone
with this app...

666
00:37:42,561 --> 00:37:43,831
called YOUniverse on it.

667
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:45,599
The universe is always
eavesdropping.

668
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:48,297
There's this unicorn and if the
unicorn posts a tweet...

669
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,740
in the woods and then deletes
the tweet, does it make a sound?

670
00:37:51,737 --> 00:37:55,967
Oh, man, you Californians, okay.

671
00:37:55,974 --> 00:37:58,344
I'm not crazy. I'm telling you
the truth.

672
00:37:58,343 --> 00:38:01,283
It does sound crazy, because
it's bullshit, all right?

673
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,880
Lonnie!

674
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:04,651
Look, if anyone understands the
need for fantasy, it's me.

675
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:07,980
I mean, I spend more of my time
on Azeroth than I do on earth.

676
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:09,816
But I don't go around trying
to convince people...

677
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:11,521
that I'm Archmage Khadgar
the Wizard.

678
00:38:11,523 --> 00:38:13,423
Maybe you guys do things
differently in California.

679
00:38:13,425 --> 00:38:15,955
Maybe it's the avocados, maybe
it's the stuff...

what I'm saying?

683
00:38:20,932 --> 00:38:22,902
This is a gift. This is my
favorite skateboard.

684
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:25,471
Cool.
And I want to give it to you.

685

What?
I want you to have it.

686

It's for you, come on.
That's so awesome.

remember? It's the height.

690
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:39,847
Lonnie.
I'm afraid of heights.

691
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:41,321
Get on the board.

692
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,850
Okay, here I go, um...

You're gonna be fine, Lonnie.

How high up are we right now?
An inch.

699

Well, then get out there and
take the face off! Jeez!

Okay, Kyle!

Hey.
What up?

What are you wearing?

947
00:53:41,986 --> 00:53:44,246
It's pretty sweet, right?

948
00:53:44,255 --> 00:53:47,315
You'll never guess, I just saw a
bunch of kids rocking my jersey!

949
00:53:47,325 --> 00:53:49,455
Wow.
I can't believe it, it's insane.

950
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:51,630
You know, you missed rehearsal
this morning.

951
00:53:53,264 --> 00:53:54,934
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

952
00:53:54,932 --> 00:53:57,332
I couldn't sleep last night
after the game.

953
00:53:57,335 --> 00:53:59,115
But it won't happen again.

954
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:00,899
You know, I'm a little worried
you're not gonna have...

955
00:54:00,905 --> 00:54:02,865
enough time for rehearsal now.

956
00:54:02,873 --> 00:54:04,843
You know that the Slam
is the same night as the game.

957
00:54:04,842 --> 00:54:08,842
Dani, Chorus is way more
important to me than hockey.

958
00:54:08,846 --> 00:54:10,306
I'll make it work.

959
00:54:14,318 --> 00:54:17,548
Dude! I got 2,000 likes
on my last Instagram post.

What? Every time I post
something, I lose followers.

961
00:54:20,391 --> 00:54:22,461
Hey, so, my parents...

962
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:23,930
they are super stoked to meet
you Saturday.

963
00:54:23,928 --> 00:54:25,828
Oh, yeah, I'm psyched to meet
them, too, man.

964
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:28,800
Yeah, this is funny, they
actually don't think you exist.

965
00:54:28,799 --> 00:54:30,729
My dad sat me down the other day
and he was like...

966
00:54:30,735 --> 00:54:32,425
"Is this 'Kyle' another
'Gary Wiggins'?"

967
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:34,196
Who's Gary Wiggins?

968
00:54:34,204 --> 00:54:35,974
He was my imaginary friend
when I was a kid.

969
00:54:35,973 --> 00:54:37,473
Not anymore, because he moved
away...

970
00:54:37,475 --> 00:54:39,025
he didn't leave a forwarding
address.

971
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:40,576
Anyway, my parents are super
excited that you're coming...

972
00:54:40,578 --> 00:54:42,748
so I'm stoked for them to see
that you're real.

973
00:54:42,747 --> 00:54:45,947
Moore!

974
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:47,950
What's up?! Good, man,
how are you?

975
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:51,492
Moore, come sit with us, my man.
We're celebrating tonight's win.

976
00:54:51,489 --> 00:54:54,589
That's all right. I'll catch up
with you guys tomorrow.

977
00:54:54,592 --> 00:54:56,212
No, no, go with them.

978
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:57,829
No, I gotta go home anyways
and do some gaming.

979
00:54:57,828 --> 00:55:00,028
I'm a gamer, so...
You sure?

980
00:55:00,031 --> 00:55:02,431
Yeah, no, celebrate.
Cool.

981
00:55:02,433 --> 00:55:03,533
Yeah, go.
Okay.

982
00:55:03,534 --> 00:55:04,734
Come on.
Yeah...

983
00:55:04,735 --> 00:55:06,465
There he is.

984
00:55:08,005 --> 00:55:10,365
So, where's Derek?

985
00:55:10,374 --> 00:55:11,674
Probably picking the splinters
out of his ass...

986
00:55:11,676 --> 00:55:13,126
from sitting all game.

987
00:55:13,126 --> 00:55:14,576
The Zamboni saw more ice time
than he did.

988
00:55:14,578 --> 00:55:15,978
Can I get you anything?

989
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:18,080
Yes, I'll have a cheeseburger,
fries and a shake.

990
00:55:18,082 --> 00:55:22,992
Oh my god, Cassie, what are you
gonna name your food baby?

991
00:55:22,987 --> 00:55:27,657
J-k, obviously, I'll just take
a stick of celery, please.

Hi.
Hi?

Yeah, I know.

Cool.

995
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:36,571
So how's it feel to be the guy
that everyone's talking about?

996
00:55:36,567 --> 00:55:38,027
I don't know if that's true.

997
00:55:40,738 --> 00:55:42,938
I bought a new perfume.
Do you want to smell me?

998
00:55:44,342 --> 00:55:49,882
Uh... yeah. I do, I mean, sure.

999

I-I love it.

I'm not wearing any perfume.

this Saturday.

I am?

To hockey! One-timers, slap
shots and kick saves!

Bone crushing hits that send

all these people are gonna do...
