you've lost weight.

Last time I saw you, I don't
know if you were this size,

which is not to say that you
didn't look good back then.

- Let her freak.
- Mmm!

I love Hiccup and Stringy.
It's my total fave.

68
00:03:17,645 --> 00:03:21,116
I'll do it for you, but only
if you do the Stringy voice.

69

Hey, gorgeous!

- Now, what's your name?
- Steven Spielberg.

76
00:03:37,899 --> 00:03:39,898
Maybe I should try looking
under "Douchebag."

77
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,368
I think Gil would probably
want you to move Keith

That's the sound

84

I have a little dick,

85

Hey, everybody, look.

105
00:05:03,318 --> 00:05:05,552

- Fucking prick.

00:05:19,835 --> 00:05:22,001
Can I get a photo
with you guys?

112
00:05:22,003 --> 00:05:24,203
Sure, sure, anything
for the fans, right, Keith?

113
00:05:24,205 --> 00:05:25,705
- Yeah.
- Sure, sure, come on.

You missed your calling.

121
00:05:40,922 --> 00:05:42,388
You should've been
a photographer, Hadji.

- Yeah, great.

124

Hope you catch something

Where the fucking hat
I bought you? Where's the hat?

128
00:05:54,736 --> 00:05:57,670
Nobody knows who the fuck you are
without the hat on your head.

129
00:05:57,672 --> 00:05:59,638
I believe the appropriate
term is "turban."

130
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,607
Okay, turban, the jihabi,

131
00:06:01,609 --> 00:06:04,110
the Pamper you was wearing
on your fucking head.

132
00:06:04,112 --> 00:06:07,713
A jibjab rag, a diaper,
where's the fucking hat?

133
00:06:07,715 --> 00:06:09,518
- Um...
- You know this guy?

134
00:06:09,951 --> 00:06:12,585
Harold? Kumar?

135
00:06:12,587 --> 00:06:15,088
I'm not fucking either
of those people.

136
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,624
Callahan. This is
my head of security,

137
00:06:17,626 --> 00:06:19,292
and this is my brother-in-law,

138
00:06:19,294 --> 00:06:21,627
and I'm gonna let him
loose on your ass

139
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:23,763
if you rearrange
my seating again.

140
00:06:23,765 --> 00:06:25,198
I don't play that shit.

141
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,437
Get Jay on the phone.
Motherfucker!

142
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,112
Can't even move fast enough
to fucking scare me.

143

Osama bin fucking eating.

144
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,350
- Seriously?
- Yeah, dude.

145
00:06:43,352 --> 00:06:45,518
She left me for her fucking
personal trainer.

146
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,186
I should've known
something was up.

147
00:06:47,188 --> 00:06:48,554
She would go to the gym
in high heels.

148
00:06:48,556 --> 00:06:50,023
Who works out in high heels?

149
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:51,657
Staying fat wasn't a clue?

150
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:53,227
She filed for divorce,
emptied the bank account,

151
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:55,028
kicked me out
of the apartment.

152
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,463
Can't you get spousal support
or something?

153
00:06:57,465 --> 00:06:59,299
Yeah, I would need
a lawyer for that,

154
00:06:59,301 --> 00:07:00,934
and I'm already paying for

Hey, you see that guy?
Is he your type?

320
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:52,245
Over you?
A thousand times, yes.

321
00:13:52,247 --> 00:13:54,816
How about Adam King of
the Cocks over there?

322
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:56,982
He's a prick.

323
00:13:56,984 --> 00:13:59,419
Hides it well
from the fans though.

324
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,387
Well, you and Mr. Sulu,
that really happening?

to let this go.

You're too pretty
to give good head.

Never had to work for it.
I'm just not that into you.

328

When you're banging
Chairman Mao,

329
00:14:11,933 --> 00:14:13,632
do you think of me
the whole time

330
00:14:13,634 --> 00:14:15,168
or just during climax?

331
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,868
Which I can only
assume happens

332
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,570
while he's neatly folding
clothes in the other room.

333
00:14:18,572 --> 00:14:21,974
Is neatness even
a racial stereotype?

334
00:14:21,976 --> 00:14:23,809
If it's not,
it should be, right?

335
00:14:23,811 --> 00:14:26,779

340

Okay. Seth Green, sir,
he needs a new chair.

345
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,840
He's too short, evidently.

Shit.

347

That's a good idea, sir.
Um, one more thing.

Oh.

352

autographs and taking photos,

363
00:15:47,061 --> 00:15:49,527
you're literally taking
money out of my pocket.

364

No, sir, I wouldn't...

365
00:15:51,032 --> 00:15:53,535
Wait. How much does
Adam King charge?

366
00:15:56,003 --> 00:15:57,306
Go pick it up.

in his room.

- Together, they are NerdGasm.

390
00:17:09,744 --> 00:17:12,043
To call these gentlemen "fans"
would be an insult.

00:28:49,542 --> 00:28:52,644
- Blow my mind.
- I fired everybody's ass.

630
00:28:52,646 --> 00:28:53,945
Ehh! Wrong.

631
00:28:53,947 --> 00:28:56,181
That is YP, not MP.

632
00:28:56,183 --> 00:28:58,215
- Your problem, not my problem.
- I got it.

633
00:28:58,217 --> 00:29:00,152
See? Even she knows
what I'm talking about.

634
00:29:00,154 --> 00:29:01,685
- Picture this.
- Aw, man!

635
00:29:01,687 --> 00:29:04,589
Hundreds of sweaty,
obese single parents,

636
00:29:04,591 --> 00:29:07,659
the walking fucking dead
with their fat little fingers

637
00:29:07,661 --> 00:29:10,761
holding illiterate
crayon signs saying,

638
00:29:10,763 --> 00:29:13,232
"Supercon sucks."

639
00:29:13,234 --> 00:29:15,867
No! Why? What?

640
00:29:15,869 --> 00:29:17,437
Leave.

(SIGHS)

642
00:29:24,311 --> 00:29:25,644
Can I have a hug?

643
00:29:25,646 --> 00:29:26,744
(SCREAMS)

644
00:29:26,746 --> 00:29:28,349
I just want a...

645
00:29:29,215 --> 00:29:31,250
You usually hug me.

646
00:29:31,252 --> 00:29:33,120
(SIGHS)

647
00:29:34,353 --> 00:29:38,022
Oh, what fools
these mortals be...

648
00:29:38,024 --> 00:29:40,125
Or not to be.

649
00:29:40,127 --> 00:29:41,960
That is the question.

650
00:29:41,962 --> 00:29:43,763
Shakespeare, baby.

651
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:50,303
I might have to ask you
for something very special.

652
00:29:51,871 --> 00:29:53,273
Lucky me.

653
00:29:53,773 --> 00:29:54,908
Yes.

654
00:29:56,577 --> 00:29:59,243
- Uh, Gil.
- What do you want today?

655
00:29:59,245 --> 00:30:01,046
It was all my fault, okay?

656
00:30:01,048 --> 00:30:03,915
Fuck. Listen,
you can't fire my friends.

657
00:30:03,917 --> 00:30:05,517
You gotta un-fire 'em.

658
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:07,118
I ain't got time
for your shit today, Wheeler.

659
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,288
Well, I'm telling you, man,
this shit's gonna come out

660
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:11,356
no matter
how you wanna play it.

661
00:30:11,358 --> 00:30:16,060
Gil, listen, man, you can't
fire Allison, Brock, and Keith

662
00:30:16,062 --> 00:30:17,695
for something I fucking did.

663
00:30:17,697 --> 00:30:19,263
Watch your tone.
It's my convention.

664
00:30:19,265 --> 00:30:20,732
I'll do what the fuck
I want with it.

665
00:30:20,734 --> 00:30:22,401
But you got it all wrong, man.

666
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:23,801
Talking about
my friends, Gil.

667
00:30:23,803 --> 00:30:25,569
- Yeah, yeah, your friends?
- My friends.

668
00:30:25,571 --> 00:30:27,338
Really, yeah, whatever,
your friends.

669
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:30,041
Where... All the fucking XLs
are gone? Shit.

670
00:30:30,043 --> 00:30:32,743
Hello. How are you?
I'm Matt Wheeler.

671
00:30:32,745 --> 00:30:34,913
It's lovely to meet you
and all your cash.

672
00:30:34,915 --> 00:30:36,115
Wow!

673
00:30:36,117 --> 00:30:38,786
Wow. Is this all the Con cash?

674
00:30:40,786 --> 00:30:43,355
Stop touching shit,
all right?

675
00:30:43,357 --> 00:30:45,523
- This is crazy.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

676
00:30:45,525 --> 00:30:48,761
Your eyes, your eyes,
avert 'em, right here.

677
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:51,396
This cash that you see?
This is mine.

678
00:30:51,398 --> 00:30:54,332
Your fucking buddy last night
went and drew a big-ass cock

679
00:30:54,334 --> 00:30:56,201
on Adam's car.

680
00:30:56,203 --> 00:30:57,669
He assaulted him.

681
00:30:57,671 --> 00:31:00,504
Keith couldn't assault
a freaking turtle, man.

682
00:31:00,506 --> 00:31:01,973
- Yeah, yeah, right.
- If he did, it's 'cause King

683
00:31:01,975 --> 00:31:04,542
was slapping his balls
time and time again.

684
00:31:04,544 --> 00:31:07,044
I could've had your ass
arrested.

685
00:31:07,046 --> 00:31:09,013
That's right,
but I didn't send you to jail.

686
00:31:09,015 --> 00:31:11,183
- You could've got... What?
- Ten years.

687
00:31:11,185 --> 00:31:13,721
But I did something
a little lighter for you.

688
00:31:15,156 --> 00:31:16,590
You're fired.

689
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:18,490
(LAUGHING)

690
00:31:18,492 --> 00:31:20,125
You're fucking fired.

691
00:31:20,127 --> 00:31:21,960
And you and your little
loser-ass friends

692
00:31:21,962 --> 00:31:25,330
don't ever, ever come back
to Supercon again.

693
00:31:25,332 --> 00:31:28,133
You're a fucking idiot.
You're banned.

694
00:31:28,135 --> 00:31:31,603
And you'll never work the
Southern cities like, uh...

695
00:31:31,605 --> 00:31:33,137
- Dallas.
- Dallas.

696
00:31:33,139 --> 00:31:34,973
- Houston.
- Houston. You love Houston.

697
00:31:34,975 --> 00:31:36,707
- Dustin.
- Dustin.

698
00:31:36,709 --> 00:31:38,376
- Fucking New Orleans.
- Baton Rouge.

699
00:31:38,378 --> 00:31:39,845
Best seafood in the world.
Baton Rouge.

700
00:31:39,847 --> 00:31:40,944
MATT: You're just
throwing out cities.

701
00:31:40,946 --> 00:31:41,849
The boot, bitch.

702
00:31:48,254 --> 00:31:49,689
You're an idiot.

703
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:53,360
You're banned.

704
00:31:55,495 --> 00:31:56,964
For life.

705
00:31:59,233 --> 00:32:00,831
You know, one of these days,

706
00:32:00,833 --> 00:32:03,667
- all this shit, all of it...
- Yeah?

707
00:32:03,669 --> 00:32:05,270
It's gonna catch up
with you.

708
00:32:05,272 --> 00:32:06,739
Yeah?

709
00:32:06,741 --> 00:32:08,776
And I'm gonna be right there
to see it.

710
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:15,547
(EVIL LAUGHTER)

KEITH: Do you piss or shit
yourself when you get tased?

714
00:32:31,631 --> 00:32:33,397
'Cause you fucking
smell like both.

715
00:32:33,399 --> 00:32:36,568
Speaking of which, I gotta
take the bus back home.

716
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:38,470
You ever been on
a fucking Greyhound?

717
00:32:38,472 --> 00:32:39,773
Mm-hmm.

718
00:32:42,341 --> 00:32:43,843
Another round, Aaron.

719
00:32:44,611 --> 00:32:47,314
The bartender. That's classy.

720
00:32:48,447 --> 00:32:51,115
Even he has a better shot
than you.

721
00:32:51,117 --> 00:32:53,753
Well, at least we all
got fired together.

722
00:32:55,554 --> 00:32:57,222
What fucking kills me

723
00:32:57,224 --> 00:33:00,291
is that Gil's making
so much money off of everyone,

724
00:33:00,293 --> 00:33:03,528
that he needs the cash machines
from <i>Scarface</i> to count it all.

725
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:06,598
- It's insane.
- Shit ain't right.

726
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,735
KEITH: You can't win
if the game's rigged.

(VIDEO GAME MUSIC)

728
00:33:12,339 --> 00:33:13,941

00:33:18,445 --> 00:33:21,615
Oh, I hope that's not what
he sounds like when he comes.

731
00:33:22,916 --> 00:33:24,749
Why are we meeting in here?

732
00:33:24,751 --> 00:33:26,818
Because it's a gym
during a comic convention.

733
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,653
This room is safer
than the White House.

734
00:33:28,655 --> 00:33:30,121
Yeah, but what are we
doing in here, Matt?

735
00:33:30,123 --> 00:33:32,089
Hey, I'm not just gonna
blurt it out.

736
00:33:32,091 --> 00:33:33,692
I'm gonna seduce you.

737
00:33:33,694 --> 00:33:35,393
Things are gonna get moist
in here, my friends.

738
00:33:35,395 --> 00:33:36,627
Very moist.

739
00:33:36,629 --> 00:33:38,128
All right, well, spit on it

740
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:39,132
and put it in already,
for fuck's sakes.

743
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:46,773
Let's rob Supercon.

744
00:33:53,013 --> 00:33:54,780
- The fuck did he just say?
- Excuse me?

745
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,080
I'm in.

746
00:33:56,082 --> 00:33:57,515
What'd you give him
last night?

747
00:33:57,517 --> 00:33:59,417
Oh, she gave me hope, baby.

748
00:33:59,419 --> 00:34:01,453
We all know
Gil is the motherfucking

749
00:34:01,455 --> 00:34:03,588
Tony Montana of Supercon.

750
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,123
Do you remember
what she said

751
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:07,157
about the stormtroopers
robbing Dragoncon?

752
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:08,795
- Yeah.
- We dress up,

753
00:34:09,462 --> 00:34:11,029
we steal the stash,

754
00:34:11,031 --> 00:34:14,032
and we walk out like
nothing every happened.

755
00:34:14,034 --> 00:34:17,735
You wanna steal
everyone's payout money?

756
00:34:17,737 --> 00:34:21,204
- You dick.
- No. That's the sexy part.

757
00:34:21,206 --> 00:34:25,242
Allison, Gil pays out everyone
working the Con Sunday morning,

758
00:34:25,244 --> 00:34:28,212
right before we all start
catching flights or buses home.

759
00:34:28,214 --> 00:34:30,982
He pays out everyone,
except Adam King,

760
00:34:30,984 --> 00:34:34,786
'cause his humongous panel is
Sunday 2 p.m., the last day.

761
00:34:34,788 --> 00:34:37,087
So the only cash left
in the office will be...

762
00:34:37,089 --> 00:34:39,391
- Gil's money.
- And King's money.

763
00:34:39,393 --> 00:34:40,858
Bringo.

764
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,726
I'm in.

765
00:34:42,728 --> 00:34:44,462
Yeah, but the cops will
catch us in a heartbeat.

766
00:34:44,464 --> 00:34:45,831
You bet your flabby ass
they would,

767
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,299
but who's calling
the cops, man?

768
00:34:47,301 --> 00:34:49,134
IRS will be all over him,

769
00:34:49,136 --> 00:34:51,469
plus an audit would show that
he's been skimming off the top

770
00:34:51,471 --> 00:34:52,840
all these years.

771
00:34:53,306 --> 00:34:54,607
I'm in.

772
00:34:56,942 --> 00:34:58,946
You're nuts.
(SLAMS BAG)

773
00:34:59,346 --> 00:35:00,748
Talk to me.

774
00:35:01,415 --> 00:35:02,713
I'm outta here.

775
00:35:02,715 --> 00:35:04,415
Enjoy your heist there,
Danny Ocean.

776
00:35:04,417 --> 00:35:06,351
- Where you going, little lady?
- I got a bus to catch.

777
00:35:06,353 --> 00:35:08,954
Your idea fucking sucks,
and my ass isn't that flabby.

778
00:35:08,956 --> 00:35:11,755
You didn't even hear the plan,
Casey Affleck.

779
00:35:11,757 --> 00:35:13,058
I heard enough,
and Casey Affleck

780
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,625
is easily the better Affleck.

781
00:35:15,627 --> 00:35:17,130
Later, fuckface.

782
00:35:18,364 --> 00:35:21,734
Go get him. Go get him.

783
00:35:24,103 --> 00:35:25,705
Don't move.

784
00:35:33,013 --> 00:35:35,815
Keith, wait up, you big puss.

785
00:35:37,016 --> 00:35:38,782
At least hear
the plan first, Keith.

786
00:35:38,784 --> 00:35:41,052
You did enough, man,
all right?

787
00:35:41,054 --> 00:35:43,454
You just got me fired from my
only fucking source of income,

788
00:35:43,456 --> 00:35:46,190
and now you want me to go to prison,
for five to ten years? Fuck that.

789
00:35:46,192 --> 00:35:49,393
I needed the fucking money
from this weekend.

790
00:35:49,395 --> 00:35:52,230
Look, your share of the money
from this plan,

791
00:35:52,232 --> 00:35:55,032
you're gonna be a very wealthy
terrorist, my friend.

792
00:35:55,034 --> 00:35:57,268
I don't know if you know this,
but you're a white guy.

793
00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:00,137
You have all the opportunities
in the world in Hollywood.

794
00:36:00,139 --> 00:36:01,306
I don't have shit.

795
00:36:01,308 --> 00:36:02,639
You could be a leading man.

796
00:36:02,641 --> 00:36:04,141
You could be a fucking
supporting role.

797
00:36:04,143 --> 00:36:06,945
You can be a Japanese woman
if you needed to be.

798
00:36:06,947 --> 00:36:08,679
I was a series regular
for five years

799
00:36:08,681 --> 00:36:10,282
on fucking <i>Tex Johnson,</i>

800
00:36:10,284 --> 00:36:12,317
and my parents took
every dime I made.

801
00:36:12,319 --> 00:36:15,052
These conventions are the only
thing that give me any money,

802
00:36:15,054 --> 00:36:17,721
and thanks to you, I don't
even have that anymore.

803
00:36:17,723 --> 00:36:19,389
I haven't worked
in over a fucking year,

804
00:36:19,391 --> 00:36:20,826
and I just lost my agent.

805
00:36:21,161 --> 00:36:22,360
Why?

806
00:36:22,362 --> 00:36:24,094
'Cause she's
a fucking asshole.

807
00:36:24,096 --> 00:36:25,896
She keeps wanting me
to go out for these auditions

808
00:36:25,898 --> 00:36:28,567
for Terrorist Number One
and fucking Cab Driver

809
00:36:28,569 --> 00:36:30,268
and 7-Eleven
and Call Center.

810
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:31,837
Well, with your share
of the money,

811
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,538
you can buy a 7-Eleven.

812
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,373
I don't need
a fucking 7-Eleven!

813
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:38,576
I'm not going to jail 'cause
I'll be a fucking candy bar.

814
00:36:38,578 --> 00:36:40,177
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

815
00:36:40,179 --> 00:36:42,813
I'm sorry that every
acting job you go out for

816
00:36:42,815 --> 00:36:44,616
is for some racist shit.

817
00:36:44,618 --> 00:36:46,751
But you can't just walk away.

818
00:36:46,753 --> 00:36:48,386
Who wrote Harry Potter?

819
00:36:48,388 --> 00:36:49,755
Some fucking bitch in England.

820
00:36:49,757 --> 00:36:52,357
WOMAN: You mean J.K. Rowling?

821
00:36:52,359 --> 00:36:53,958
- Yeah, you fucking dork.
- Yeah, thanks!

822
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,995
- J.K. Fucking Rowling.
- Dumbledore!

823
00:36:58,697 --> 00:37:02,632
She wrote that book after her
husband left her stone cold.

824
00:37:02,634 --> 00:37:04,536
J.K. had no money.

825
00:37:04,538 --> 00:37:06,603
J.K. had a baby to feed.

826
00:37:06,605 --> 00:37:08,239
J.K. had to go on welfare.

827
00:37:08,241 --> 00:37:09,741
J.K. didn't rob anybody.

828
00:37:09,743 --> 00:37:11,342
She wrote a children's
fucking book.

829
00:37:11,344 --> 00:37:13,378
J.K. grew some balls.

830
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,380
And that's
what I'm talking about.

831

I was looking for you
in your hotel room.

After the party last night,
it was barely habitable.

You're gonna get the bill.
Don't get cheap on me, man.

All right, yeah.

00:38:54,746 --> 00:38:56,547
So what's up, Gil?

I thought you said you were
gonna fix things around here.

the autograph and photo money.

- Exactly.
- (FARTS)

940

So we have to get that money

before it gets backstage
and into King's hands.

<i>When he gets to Gil's office,
he rappels down...</i>

<i>Think first</i>
Mission: Impossible...

948

- <i>And takes out Callahan...</i>
- VIDEO GAME ANNOUNCER: <i>Fatality.</i>

949
00:42:26,192 --> 00:42:28,958
MATT: <i>Sub-Zero style
from</i> Mortal Kombat.

950
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,929
<i>Allison, you're gonna be
looking like Emilia Clarke</i>

951
00:42:31,931 --> 00:42:34,864
<i>riding in on a fucking dragon.</i>

952
00:42:34,866 --> 00:42:37,335
<i>You lure Gil all the way
to the loading dock.</i>

953
00:42:37,337 --> 00:42:40,637
<i>And just when Gil thinks
he's gonna get lucky,</i>

954
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:42,540
<i>you drop a lighter
into a puddle of gasoline</i>

955
00:42:42,542 --> 00:42:45,175
<i>that Gil just happens
to be standing in,</i>

956
00:42:45,177 --> 00:42:48,179
<i>turning him into
the Human Torch.</i>

957

(SCREAMS)

958
00:42:50,917 --> 00:42:53,351
MATT: <i>Now, me and Keith
are gonna meet up with Brock.</i>

959
00:42:53,353 --> 00:42:55,820
<i>We crack the safe,
we load up the bags,</i>

960
00:42:55,822 --> 00:42:58,288
<i>and we get the fuck
out of there.</i>

961
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:00,257
<i>We all meet up out front
of the Con.</i>

962
00:43:00,259 --> 00:43:02,293
<i>We're scot-free.
We celebrate.</i>

963
00:43:02,295 --> 00:43:06,396
<i>Me and Allison make out,
just like she always planned.</i>

964
00:43:06,398 --> 00:43:09,567
That's the plan?
So much wrong with that plan.

965
00:43:09,569 --> 00:43:12,904
You think I'm gonna just
light a man on fire?

966
00:43:12,906 --> 00:43:14,538
KEITH:
What about Adam King?

967
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,440
What about security cameras?
What about Callahan?

968
00:43:16,442 --> 00:43:18,409
What about people seeing
our fucking faces?

969
00:43:18,411 --> 00:43:20,478
Why don't we just do
the stormtropper thing?

970
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,813
Because we're doing an original.
This is not a sequel.

971
00:43:22,815 --> 00:43:25,382
But I'm wearing
a Targaryen princess outfit

972
00:43:25,384 --> 00:43:26,817
for absolutely no reason?

973
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:28,286
Well, one reason.

974
00:43:28,288 --> 00:43:29,954
I think I could still
catch that bus.

975
00:43:29,956 --> 00:43:33,190
- Well, I'm in.
- MATT: Thank you, Brock.

976
00:43:33,192 --> 00:43:37,328
You can still grow some balls
in plan B.

977
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:39,530
<i>Right before Adam King's
panel starts,</i>

978
00:43:39,532 --> 00:43:41,733
<i>Keith and I will be
on the floor in costumes,</i>

979
00:43:41,735 --> 00:43:43,032
<i>so we won't get caught.</i>

980
00:43:43,034 --> 00:43:44,802
Yeah, bitch.

981
00:43:44,804 --> 00:43:47,103
<i>Callahan will be on guard
outside Gil's office.</i>

982
00:43:47,105 --> 00:43:48,739
<i>Allison,
it's gonna be your job</i>

983
00:43:48,741 --> 00:43:51,241
<i>to seduce Callahan
away from the office.</i>

984
00:43:51,243 --> 00:43:54,177
<i>You do this by having sex
with Callahan.</i>

985
00:43:54,179 --> 00:43:55,813
<i>And in the middle of
that disgusting act,</i>

986
00:43:55,815 --> 00:43:58,849
<i>you knock out Callahan
with a tire iron.</i>

987
00:43:58,851 --> 00:44:01,319
<i>Now, after breaking in
through the air vents,</i>

988
00:44:01,321 --> 00:44:03,686
<i>Brock, you're gonna radio me
and Keith, so we can come in,</i>

989
00:44:03,688 --> 00:44:07,592
<i>grab the cash,
and skedaddlee-do outta there.</i>

990
00:44:07,594 --> 00:44:09,626
<i>Allison, you're gonna
infiltrate, that's right,</i>

991
00:44:09,628 --> 00:44:11,462
<i>infiltrate
the security office</i>

992
00:44:11,464 --> 00:44:13,364
<i>and wipe all
the security footage clean,</i>

993
00:44:13,366 --> 00:44:15,800
<i>wearing a different
sexy cosplay outfit.</i>

994
00:44:15,802 --> 00:44:17,201
<i>Dealer's choice.</i>

995
00:44:17,203 --> 00:44:18,768
<i>We meet up in the parking lot.</i>

996
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:22,273
<i>We drive off into the sunset
in Bigfoot Number One.</i>

(ENGINE REVVING)

998
00:44:23,808 --> 00:44:27,145
<i>Allison, you and me
make out hard.</i>

999
00:44:27,147 --> 00:44:30,047
<i>Go big, finish big.</i>

1000
00:44:30,049 --> 00:44:33,951
Why am I the whore?
Why can't Keith be the whore?

1001
00:44:33,953 --> 00:44:36,087
- Well...
- I'll be the whore.

1002
00:44:36,089 --> 00:44:38,690
Bigfoot?
What, do you live in the '80s?

1003
00:44:38,692 --> 00:44:41,960
Oh, yeah, and on that note, I
cannot drive a monster truck.

1004
00:44:41,962 --> 00:44:44,029
You did in <i>Downtown Crime.</i>

1005
00:44:44,031 --> 00:44:46,764
That was Gary Jensen,
stuntman.

1006
00:44:46,766 --> 00:44:52,436
Not a problem, 'cause I got it
all worked out in plan C.

1007
00:44:52,438 --> 00:44:55,405
- Plan C?
- Plan C?

1008
00:44:55,407 --> 00:44:56,875
<i>Same thing out front.</i>

1009
00:44:56,877 --> 00:44:58,808
<i>Me and Keith are gonna
be on the floor.</i>

1010
00:44:58,810 --> 00:45:00,710
<i>Brock, you're in
your favorite place.</i>

1011
00:45:00,712 --> 00:45:02,846
<i>Allison, you're still
distracting Callahan,</i>

1012
00:45:02,848 --> 00:45:04,681
<i>but you're not
having sex with him.</i>

1013
00:45:04,683 --> 00:45:07,050
<i>You just need to get him away
from that door.</i>

1014
00:45:07,052 --> 00:45:09,353
<i>You're gonna be hauling ass
over to the security office,</i>

1015
00:45:09,355 --> 00:45:11,755
<i>and you're gonna be wiping all
the security footage clean,</i>

1016
00:45:11,757 --> 00:45:15,659
<i>wearing a sexy,
tiny Japanese anime number.</i>

1017
00:45:15,661 --> 00:45:18,429
<i>Brock rappels down
the air vent.</i>

1018
00:45:18,431 --> 00:45:20,398
<i>He unlocks the door
for me and Keith.</i>

1019
00:45:21,032 --> 00:45:22,632
<i>We crack the safe,</i>

1020
00:45:22,634 --> 00:45:25,402
<i>we load up all the bags
and get the heck outta there.</i>

1021
00:45:25,404 --> 00:45:27,137
<i>We meet at the getaway car,</i>

- Hold up.
- (GUNSHOTS)

1025
00:45:32,878 --> 00:45:35,945
I'm not happy about being
on security detail,

1026
00:45:35,947 --> 00:45:37,415
but I'll do it.

1027
00:45:37,417 --> 00:45:38,949
But you're in
for the outfits, right?

1028
00:45:38,951 --> 00:45:41,386
Problem is,
if we wipe the security cams,

1029
00:45:41,388 --> 00:45:44,956
we can't keep track of Adam
King and Gil on the floor.

1030
00:45:44,958 --> 00:45:46,991
Not a problem.
We got Brock in the air vents.

1031
00:45:46,993 --> 00:45:48,759
Cover all our asses.

1032
00:45:48,761 --> 00:45:51,228
Where are these cars
coming from?

1033
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:53,230
It's my plan, man.
I get to pick the cars.

1034
00:45:53,232 --> 00:45:54,532
Hey, I got an idea.

1035
00:45:54,534 --> 00:45:56,900
Why don't we
just take a shuttle bus?

1036
00:45:56,902 --> 00:46:00,137
This plan you speak of
is full of holes.

1037
00:46:00,139 --> 00:46:01,807
- Shut up, Matt.
- (MUMBLES)

1038
00:46:02,842 --> 00:46:07,110
However, I think
we can really do this.

1039
00:46:07,112 --> 00:46:09,248
Guys, we gonna do this?

1040
00:46:09,748 --> 00:46:10,884
I'm in.

1041
00:46:13,219 --> 00:46:14,521
I'm in.

1042
00:46:17,958 --> 00:46:20,594
It's like the tip of my cock
in your ass, Matt.

1043
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,696
I'm in.

1044
00:46:24,897 --> 00:46:26,096
Yes!

1045
00:46:26,098 --> 00:46:28,099
We still need one more person

1046
00:46:28,101 --> 00:46:29,333
just to keep their
eyes on Gil.

1047
00:46:29,335 --> 00:46:30,737
And King.

1048
00:46:34,906 --> 00:46:36,642
I have an idea.

1049
00:46:40,279 --> 00:46:43,179
- I really should've been Obama.
- Why?

1050
00:46:43,181 --> 00:46:46,449
I don't know, it looks like
they outsourced Trump's hands.

1051
00:46:46,451 --> 00:46:47,985
Where the hell is Brock?

1052
00:46:47,987 --> 00:46:49,320
Right here.

1053
00:46:49,322 --> 00:46:52,223
What, this old thing?
(LAUGHS)

1054
00:46:52,225 --> 00:46:53,493
Watch it.

1055
00:46:54,226 --> 00:46:55,759
SID: Kirby taught me...

1056
00:46:55,761 --> 00:46:56,927
There's our guy.

1057
00:46:56,929 --> 00:46:58,362
How to be more dramatic,

1058
00:46:58,364 --> 00:47:00,697
how to make things
bigger than life,

1059
00:47:00,699 --> 00:47:03,134
and he was absolutely right.

1060
00:47:03,136 --> 00:47:05,335
Kirby was a wonderful man.

1061
00:47:05,337 --> 00:47:07,337
I mean, he taught me so much.

1062
00:47:07,339 --> 00:47:08,808
Um, Sid, hi.

1063
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:13,210
- Allie bear.
- Rrr.

1064
00:47:13,212 --> 00:47:16,146
Hi. Love this disguise.

1065
00:47:16,148 --> 00:47:18,616
It's a Louise Brooks
sort of goth nerd?

1066
00:47:18,618 --> 00:47:20,951
It's Louise Brooks-ish, yeah.

1067
00:47:20,953 --> 00:47:24,922
Everybody, this is my favorite
artist working today,

1068
00:47:24,924 --> 00:47:28,090
Allison McNealy,
and she is great.

1069
00:47:28,092 --> 00:47:31,529
Oh, by the way, great work
on your book <i>Battle Worlds.</i>

1070
00:47:31,531 --> 00:47:33,764
It's fantastic. Great, kiddo.

1071
00:47:33,766 --> 00:47:34,898
Thanks.

1072
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:36,536
Thank you, Sid.

1073
00:47:37,802 --> 00:47:40,570
Willie Nelson
is playing a concert.

1074
00:47:40,572 --> 00:47:42,674
Sorry, hon.
I'm a little deaf.

1075
00:47:43,543 --> 00:47:45,576
Willie Nelson
is playing a concert.

1076
00:47:45,578 --> 00:47:49,382
This is... That's Vietnam,
so you have to speak loud.

1077
00:47:50,549 --> 00:47:52,451
We've got great weed.

1078
00:47:53,252 --> 00:47:55,855
Guys, back in 20!

1079
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:07,230
How much of this shit
have you kids been smoking?

1080
00:48:07,232 --> 00:48:08,801
KEITH: Not enough.

1081
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:13,871
Whoa!

1082
00:48:13,873 --> 00:48:16,907
Hey, you're in <i>Silicon Valley.</i>

1083
00:48:16,909 --> 00:48:19,677
- <i>Parks and Rec.</i>
- Oh, that's not as funny.

1084
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:21,348
I mean, it's still good.

1085
00:48:22,281 --> 00:48:24,248
I guess it's good.

1086
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:26,884
Sid, come on,
what do you think?

1087
00:48:26,886 --> 00:48:28,886
- You in?
- I don't know, folks.

1088
00:48:28,888 --> 00:48:32,588
I'm still trying to wrap
my head around this thing.

1089
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:35,893
Which does not make it
not the right thing to do.

1090
00:48:35,895 --> 00:48:38,429
I have a longer, darker
history with Adam King

1091
00:48:38,431 --> 00:48:40,396
than you kids know about.

1092
00:48:40,398 --> 00:48:42,465
Back in '79,

1093
00:48:42,467 --> 00:48:45,335
my lovely ex-wife,
God rest her soul,

1094
00:48:45,337 --> 00:48:47,137
warned me
that he was gonna screw me

1095
00:48:47,139 --> 00:48:52,409
on the <i>Future Force</i> TV deal,
which he did.

1096
00:48:52,411 --> 00:48:54,911
Had to fight for years
to get the rights back,

1097
00:48:54,913 --> 00:48:57,681
spent a small fortune
doing it.

1098
00:48:57,683 --> 00:49:02,552
Now I just wanna
share stories with fans,

1099
00:49:02,554 --> 00:49:06,893
and not with the inmates
of cell block D.

1100
00:49:09,996 --> 00:49:14,797
I grew up reading your comics,
Mr. Newberry.

1101
00:49:14,799 --> 00:49:18,735
What made your comics great
wasn't the superheroes.

1102
00:49:18,737 --> 00:49:21,672
Your books were about
human morality

1103
00:49:21,674 --> 00:49:24,007
wrapped in a superhero cape.

1104
00:49:24,009 --> 00:49:25,809
When those pages
were open, man,

1105
00:49:25,811 --> 00:49:28,145
I didn't think about
being the weird kid,

1106
00:49:28,147 --> 00:49:31,681
I didn't think about Tito Lopez
kicking my ass in the fourth grade.

1107
00:49:31,683 --> 00:49:35,119
When I was reading your books,
I wasn't alone.

1108
00:49:35,121 --> 00:49:36,820
That's it. The people
who come to these cons,

1109
00:49:36,822 --> 00:49:38,956
and I'm talking about
all of us,

1110
00:49:38,958 --> 00:49:42,628
this is where
we don't feel alone.

1111
00:49:45,098 --> 00:49:46,833
The Adam Kings of the world?

1112
00:49:48,234 --> 00:49:49,601
The Gils?

1113
00:49:50,636 --> 00:49:52,571
They're robbing that from us.

1114
00:49:53,339 --> 00:49:54,739
They overcharge,

1115
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:57,543
and they treat the fans
like shit.

1116
00:49:59,511 --> 00:50:00,946
Sid...

1117
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:04,384
We wanna take it back
for the fans.

1118
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:26,704
You know, either this grass
is really, really good,

1119
00:50:26,706 --> 00:50:29,306
or this kid just
monologued me.

1120
00:50:29,308 --> 00:50:30,940
Sid.

1121
00:50:30,942 --> 00:50:32,946
Listen, that was very good.
I wish I had a pen.

1122
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:37,380
Sid, is that a yes?
Is that a yes?

1123
00:50:37,382 --> 00:50:39,951
You're great kids,

1124
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:43,052
and Adam King is
an incredible asshole,

1125
00:50:43,054 --> 00:50:45,590
but unfortunately,
he makes up a major part

1126
00:50:45,592 --> 00:50:48,692
of my retirement income,

1127
00:50:48,694 --> 00:50:51,697
so you see,
he's my necessary evil.

1128
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:57,433
Let's do another book soon.

1129
00:50:57,435 --> 00:50:58,971
Good luck, guys.

1130
00:50:59,873 --> 00:51:00,940
Sid...

1131
00:51:02,775 --> 00:51:04,643
Can you at least
think about it?

1132
00:51:05,643 --> 00:51:08,679
Not if I smoke
any more of that weed.

1133
00:51:08,681 --> 00:51:11,382
I'm gonna go play
some Allman Brothers.

Mr. King!

Mr. King, can I please
have your autograph?

1143

Sure, big guy, anything
for a <i>Future Force</i> fan.

give it for me for free.

1151
00:51:55,761 --> 00:51:58,030
Oh, I don't...
I just thought...

1152
00:51:59,232 --> 00:52:02,333
Golden Guardian doesn't
work for free, kid.

1153

1179

Fearless leader.

refused to shine.

"I guess I'll go."

True.

Do you think you

can handle 10 years

1406
01:04:51,603 --> 01:04:54,170
Puts the dump in cumdump.

1407
01:04:54,172 --> 01:04:56,773
He's so gay,
he puts an S in turtle.

1408
01:04:56,775 --> 01:05:01,011
Damn light's not working.
Damn this piece of shit.

1409
01:05:01,013 --> 01:05:03,882
I'm above the office.
Get in here.

1410
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:07,616
KEITH: We should've got Brock
for this.

1411
01:05:07,618 --> 01:05:10,654
I see, I see
a bunch of Xenas here.

1412
01:05:10,656 --> 01:05:12,489
Look, yeah,
there's one up there.

1413
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:14,824
Ooh, very nice.
You should move down in front.

1414
01:05:14,826 --> 01:05:17,094
- (LAUGHTER)
- Very good.

1415
01:05:17,096 --> 01:05:21,331
Ah, Lucy. Do we love Lucy?
Do we all love Lucy Lawless?

1416
01:05:21,333 --> 01:05:23,666
I met Lucy
many, many years ago.

1417
01:05:23,668 --> 01:05:25,735
Of course, she wasn't
Lucy Lawless then.

1418
01:05:25,737 --> 01:05:28,505
She was Lucy Kiwi...
I don't know.

1419
01:05:28,507 --> 01:05:32,675
This statuesque,
remarkably clear-skinned girl

1420
01:05:32,677 --> 01:05:35,779
comes up and gets her diploma,
and I said, "Who is that?"

1421
01:05:35,781 --> 01:05:39,047
She was, boy, barely 18,
I think, and she was...

1422
01:05:39,049 --> 01:05:42,418
- Guys, Gil's starting to move.
- MATT: <i>Stall him, Sid.</i>

1423
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:43,886
- How?
- <i>The Elvis story.</i>

1424
01:05:43,888 --> 01:05:45,855
Gil, I just wanted
to thank you

1425
01:05:45,857 --> 01:05:48,458
for letting me hang back here
and watch King in action.

1426
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:49,592
I really appreciate it.

1427
01:05:49,594 --> 01:05:51,360
No problem, Sid, no problem.

1428
01:05:51,362 --> 01:05:53,429
Which, by the way,
speaking of King,

1429
01:05:53,431 --> 01:05:55,165
did I ever tell you
about the time

1430
01:05:55,167 --> 01:06:00,070
that Elvis and I nearly died
in a private plane crash?

1431
01:06:00,072 --> 01:06:01,737
No.

1432
01:06:01,739 --> 01:06:04,074
When the scene was over,
which got a little steamy,

1433
01:06:04,076 --> 01:06:05,541
the director yelled cut,

1434
01:06:05,543 --> 01:06:07,476
she looked down at me,
and she said...

1435
01:06:07,478 --> 01:06:09,746
CROWD: Whoa!

1436
01:06:09,748 --> 01:06:13,148
"Yes! You are the King!"
(LAUGHS)

1437
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:15,018
Don't stop me
if you've heard this story.

1438
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:18,320
July 4th of 1971, yeah,
'cause it was right after

1439
01:06:18,322 --> 01:06:20,489
Elvis did his big
comeback special,

1440
01:06:20,491 --> 01:06:22,925
the one with
the black leathers.

1441
01:06:22,927 --> 01:06:25,228
- Uh-huh
- Anyway, we're on the plane,

1442
01:06:25,230 --> 01:06:27,697
Sonny and Red and me and E,

1443
01:06:27,699 --> 01:06:30,433
and all of a sudden,
on the way back to Memphis,

1444
01:06:30,435 --> 01:06:33,770
the Colonel just brings out
this huge bag of mushrooms.

1445
01:06:33,772 --> 01:06:35,739
- What?
- I mean, just incredible.

1446
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:38,741
Don't you think people are
too hard on the new DC movies?

1447
01:06:38,743 --> 01:06:41,344
You know what I really love
about the new Supes?

1448
01:06:41,346 --> 01:06:43,947
What's that?

1449
01:06:43,949 --> 01:06:46,949
Red undies on the inside
because, you know...

1450
01:06:46,951 --> 01:06:49,351
Hey, Sid, I gotta go.
Have a good one.

1451
01:06:49,353 --> 01:06:51,357
Sick bastard.

1452
01:06:51,924 --> 01:06:53,723
Douche nozzle.

1453
01:06:53,725 --> 01:06:55,958
Okay, you guys, we lost him.
I can't hold him.

1454
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:59,494
The walrus
is back in the water.

No, I wasn't trying...

Does this ass look
like a ma'am to you?

1462
01:07:13,444 --> 01:07:15,277
- Ma'am, you have to leave.
- Oh, you just said it again.

- MATT: <i>Oh, yeah.</i>
- What?

1467
01:07:25,757 --> 01:07:27,389
You get to tell me what to do

1472

And I ain't no Nazi.
