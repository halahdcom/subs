1
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:29,289
Okay.

2
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:17,912
Whoo!
Upsy-daisy!

3
00:02:18,062 --> 00:02:19,439
Up, up, baby!
Yeah.

4
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:23,643
Come on, baby!
Here we go!

5
00:02:23,793 --> 00:02:26,146
Yeah! Whoo!

6
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:27,764
Fight for
that air, baby!

7
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,916
Fight for
that air, baby!

8
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:10,790
Whoo!
Yeah!

9
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,252
Remember when your mother
used to bring us here?

10
00:03:39,402 --> 00:03:40,470
Ages ago.

11
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,889
Every single summer
for a week.

12
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:44,991
Till...

13
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:46,926
Till Dad passed.

14
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,496
I'm sorry.
I didn't...

15
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,501
What are you
laughing at?

16
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:59,739
Remember our first skinny
dip in the midnight moon?

17
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,809
We couldn't find our clothes
when we came back to shore!

18
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:07,163
I was freaking out,
thinking some maniac stole them.

19
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:09,716
Of course I remember.
I was the one that had to walk home naked.

20
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:11,768
And Mom was furious!

21
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,520
Yeah, but we were the ones that
stayed in the freezing water

22
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,722
until you got back.

23
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,552
Hey, Mom! Yeah.
We just pulled up.

24
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:50,490
No. We haven't been
inside yet, but, uh,

25
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,292
everything looks fine.

26
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:55,928
Sure. I'll call you in a bit.
Just give us the time to...

27
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,698
I will.

28
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:01,434
Okay. Love you, too. Bye.

29
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,636
Mom.

30
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:44,877
Let's go get our bags.

31
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:27,153
Everything is exactly
the way I remember it.

32
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,555
All right.
Pick your room.

33
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:37,797
Hm.

34
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:49,475
Ohh!

35
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,045
This is the best room
in the house.

36
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:56,616
Oh, my God!
It's just so cozy!

37
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,153
Oh, I miss this smell!
Oh!

38
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:31,034
Hey.

39
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:34,020
Whoo!
I wasn't sure that's where it was going.

40
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,655
Yeah.

41
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,892
Let's see a trick.

42
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,103
Lory? You need anything?

43
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,975
I hope this isn't
too hard on you.

44
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,272
The pleasure of
having you here

45
00:08:01,422 --> 00:08:03,049
is stronger than...
any regret.

46
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:06,219
Thanks.

47
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,187
This was a beautiful way
to say goodbye.

48
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:13,559
Who is it?

49
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,961
David.

50
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:17,964
Jim's nephew.
Caretaker's my uncle.

51
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,567
Hey.

52
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:23,736
Where's Jim?

53
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,571
He's resting.
He caught a cold.

54
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,573
Oh. I'll stop by
in the morning.

55
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,774
Anytime.

56
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:31,777
Hey, you ladies
need anything?

57
00:08:31,927 --> 00:08:33,045
We're fine.
Thank you.

58
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,548
Tell Jim I'll be here
until Sunday.

59
00:08:35,698 --> 00:08:36,716
Right.

60
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,017
Are you expecting
any more guests?

61
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,953
No. Goodnight.

62
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,089
Goodnight.

63
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,647
Mm.

64
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,783
Connection always sucked
around here.

65
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:12,919
Lory, stop it.

66
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,091
There hasn't been any crime in
this area since I can remember.

67
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,594
Not even a stolen CD.

68
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:25,197
Perfect opportunity to tell
you about my new novel.

69
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,135
You're not gonna spook us again,
are you?

70
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,337
Readers like
to be spooked.

71
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,606
Not me. Not tonight.

72
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,675
Mm-mmm.

73
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,710
All right. Tell us.

74
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,615
It takes place...

75
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:45,685
in the house by the lake.

76
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:47,253
You must be kidding.

77
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,959
It actually takes place
in this very house.

78
00:09:53,109 --> 00:09:54,193
It begins...

79
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,729
with an 11-year-old girl...

80
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,099
the age when the
boundaries between reality

81
00:10:00,249 --> 00:10:02,034
and the inner world
are still blurred.

82
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,136
Somewhere in the woods...

83
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:10,076
three mysterious men
are discussing their evil plan.

84
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,046
A mere story
of home invasion...

85
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:18,050
mixed with
supernatural elements.

86
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:21,220
I don't like this already.

87
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,627
And yes, you're supposed
to be freaked out.

88
00:10:27,777 --> 00:10:29,095
That's... That's the point.

89
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:33,265
You see,
this time I went for a story without a plot.

90
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,935
We never figure out
why they're doing it

91
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,404
and what they hope
to gain from it.

92
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:40,189
Why?

93
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:41,974
Cause if we know
their motives...

94
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,452
we can always
convince ourselves

95
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,212
that it will
never happen to us.

96
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,282
I want to explore fear...

97
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:53,252
and masochism.

98
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:56,914
I wanna know...
How does it feel

99
00:10:57,064 --> 00:10:59,091
to be confronted
with the devil?

100
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:02,862
What if you don't
believe in it?

101
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,266
The only thing
you have to believe...

102
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,268
is that there are men...

103
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:12,972
capable of horrible acts.

104
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,976
All right. Enough.

105
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,220
Yeah. That's enough.

106
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,247
We'll read the book.

107
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:23,315
Are you finished
with it?

108
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,253
Haven't written
a page yet.

109
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:37,129
Oh, I'm going
jogging at dawn

110
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,297
if anyone wants
to join.

111
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,902
Yeah. Why don't you make us
breakfast when you come back?

112
00:11:43,052 --> 00:11:43,886
I can do that.

113
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,237
Yeah. You don't have
to do that.

114
00:11:45,387 --> 00:11:46,289
Anyway, night.

115
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,307
Goodnight.
See you in the morning.

116
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,248
It's not funny.

117
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:32,918
I know you're
in there, Kay.

118
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:45,197
Come out now!

119
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,143
Oh, my God.

120
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:49,922
What?

121
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:01,300
Dad?

122
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,507
I'm so sorry, Dad.

123
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:11,677
I'm so sorry.

124
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,037
Daddy!

125
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:42,441
Dad!

126
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:01,060
My God.
Come on. Hey.

127
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:05,998
Come on, baby.

128
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,379
There you go.
There you go.

129
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:14,573
All right.
You're good.

130
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,058
Good girl.

131
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,743
I got you.
I got you.

132
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,144
Oh, thank God.

133
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:23,299
I thought I'd lost you.

134
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:26,218
Never do that again, okay?
I promise.

135
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:37,596
Dad? Dad?

136
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:39,431
No!
No, no, no, no!

137
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:41,266
Daddy?

138
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,770
Daddy? No! No.

139
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,738
Dad. Dad!

140
00:16:46,888 --> 00:16:48,707
Mom! Mom!

141
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:50,893
D-Dad!

142
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:53,445
No, Dad. No. No.

143
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:40,626
Were you waiting
for someone?

144
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:47,666
Who is it?

145
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:09,555
Who is it?

146
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:27,539
Do it.

147
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,540
Was that a publicity stunt
for your book?

148
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:04,676
Are you
out of your mind?

149
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:08,747
David?

150
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:14,419
What do you want?

151
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:27,533
I don't like this.
Yeah. None of us do.

152
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,702
There's a hotel
ten miles from here.

153
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,705
Good idea.
Let's get our stuff.

154
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:42,648
Oh, my God!
- Belle! Lory!

155
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:44,316
Who did this?

156
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,287
Calm down.
Just grab your stuff.

157
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,288
We're gonna go.

158
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,566
Sorry.

159
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,713
Damn! I forgot the keys.

160
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:53,879
I don't like this.

161
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:07,926
You scared us.

162
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,796
All four.

163
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,010
Ah, shit.

164
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,570
Try yours.

165
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,413
Back inside. Now.

166
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,935
It's disconnected.
- Of course!

167
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:35,387
We need to calm down and
figure out what to do next.

168
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:39,951
We're gonna sleep together
upstairs tonight.

169
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,053
Kids'
room is the hardest to break into.

170
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:44,423
Six hours till dawn.

171
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,925
Whoever's doing this doesn't
know who they're fighting with.

172
00:23:47,075 --> 00:23:48,527
Well said.
We'll show them.

173
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,214
At least
we'll hear them coming.

174
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:51,149
We will.

175
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,028
They only have
one way in now.

176
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:07,198
Lift up.

177
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:18,810
Drop it.

178
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:25,750
Kay and Lory,
you sleep first.

179
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:27,752
I won't be able
to close my eyes.

180
00:26:27,902 --> 00:26:29,020
Neither will I.

181
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:31,156
Just try, at least.

182
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,242
I wonder if they get off just
knowing that we're scared.

183
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:54,779
You're optimistic.

184
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:04,923
Shh.

185
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:41,776
What? What?

186
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:42,727
Shh! Shh!
- What happened?

187
00:27:42,877 --> 00:27:43,662
Shh.

188
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:58,977
Angela. What?

189
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,115
Nothing.

190
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:12,457
Leave!

191
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:14,726
Right now!

192
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:22,100
Fuck. Fuck.

193
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:34,996
I saw it! It's here!

194
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:37,232
K... I saw it!
The terrace!

195
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,150
He's hiding
behind the wall outside!

196
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:24,929
Good evening, ladies!

197
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:26,931
How bout we drop
the weapons?

198
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:28,933
Lower them.

199
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,202
You too, honey. Mm?

200
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:34,139
Turn around.

201
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:37,242
Put it on the ground, slowly.

202
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:44,983
What do you want?

203
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:48,403
Move the bed!

204
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:52,257
Mr. Black is anxious
to make your acquaintance.

205
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:54,492
Let's go! Move the bed!
- Move it!

206
00:29:54,642 --> 00:29:55,360
Let's go!

207
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,402
Come on.

208
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:09,007
Open the door.

209
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:11,376
Open it!

210
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:18,516
And say hello to Mr. Black.

211
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:40,305
Girls!

212
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:42,173
See...

213
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:44,943
I'm a little underwhelmed.

214
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:47,412
And a little disappointed.

215
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:51,482
I expected you to be
a little bit more polite...

216
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:58,289
and obey
every single word I say.

217
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:02,594
I said,
"Say hello to Mr. Black!"

218
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:06,297
Hello.

219
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:08,399
No. No, no, no,
no, no.

220
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,202
"Hello, Mr. Black."

221
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:14,105
Hello, Mr. Black.

222
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:19,644
And you?

223
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:22,347
Look at him.

224
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:27,418
Say it!

225
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:30,421
Hello, Mr. Black.

226
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:34,525
Thank you.
It wasn't so hard, was it?

227
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,629
Now, I think
we could do...

228
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:40,131
a little bit better.

229
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:42,967
Don't you, huh?
Look at him.

230
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,136
What do you have to say?

231
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:47,906
Hello, Mr. Black.

232
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:52,243
And you? Hmm?

233
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:55,396
Huh?

234
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:56,614
Hello, Mr. Black.

235
00:31:58,149 --> 00:31:59,417
Say it louder, please.

236
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,021
Hello, Mr. Black.

237
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,359
Hello, girls.

238
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,364
Thank you for inviting us
to your party.

239
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:23,942
Shall we start...

240
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:27,478
with... the fun?

241
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,448
Please.

242
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:34,252
"Please", what?

243
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:38,289
Shh. It's okay. It's okay.
Please, don't kill us.

244
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:40,591
Kill you?

245
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:44,262
Why would I want
to kill you?

246
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,197
Blue?

247
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,633
Do you want to kill
these young ladies?

248
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:52,437
Blue!

249
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:54,739
Of course not.
Of course not.

250
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:55,707
Red!

251
00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:58,576
All we want to do
is join the party.

252
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:05,383
You see?

253
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:09,220
Hmm? Okay.

254
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:11,556
Okay.

255
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:16,561
Really?

256
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:24,569
Very well then.

257
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:30,441
Let's begin.

258
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:33,511
Take off your clothes.

259
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:38,449
Hey! Girls!

260
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,518
Don't make me repeat myself.

261
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:43,054
You're gonna regret this.

262
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:46,691
Sure. Sure.
Sure. Sure. Sure.

263
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,359
Meanwhile...

264
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,378
Take it off.

265
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:53,364
I politely ask.
No!

266
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:57,402
Okay.

267
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:00,405
Come here.

268
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:08,046
Stop!

269
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:11,783
Stop.

270
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:19,073
That wasn't much fun,
was it?

271
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:23,194
No. It actually wasn't.
Not at all.

272
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:38,309
Do you have music?

273
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:40,678
Downstairs.
Aw, yeah.

274
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,214
Music.
A little tunes.

275
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:45,550
So what are we
waiting for?

276
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:58,396
No! No! No! No! No!

277
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:02,500
Stop! No!

278
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:10,641
No! No! No! No!

279
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:20,218
Hey! Hey!
Quit it! No!

280
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:25,289
Don't you move!
Don't move a muscle!

281
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,564
Stop!

282
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:39,470
Stop. Stop.

283
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,639
That will be a lesson
to all of you.

284
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:44,709
I don't want
to kill you.

285
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:49,814
But I won't hesitate.

286
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:52,783
Do you believe me?

287
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:53,918
Yes.
Huh?

288
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:56,487
I can't hear you!

289
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:57,755
Yes!

290
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:01,893
Okay. Okay.

291
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:09,217
Downstairs.

292
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:11,452
Let's go! Let's go!

293
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:15,406
Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

294
00:36:15,556 --> 00:36:16,207
Come on!

295
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:19,644
Take off your shoes.

296
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,445
No.

297
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:22,847
Take them off!

298
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:24,715
Let's go!

299
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:35,660
You first.

300
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:37,929
Please.

301
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,598
I would love to please you.

302
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:42,567
I'll probably do it, too.

303
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:48,706
Downstairs.

304
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:52,944
Give me the chairs.
Come on!

305
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:54,946
Come on!

306
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,216
Faster!

307
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,518
Go.

308
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:06,357
Go.

309
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:08,659
Continue.

310
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:15,233
Don't even think about it.

311
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,335
I will kill her.

312
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:21,706
Don't do it.

313
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:24,125
Come on! Move!

314
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:25,409
Come on! Move!

315
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:27,678
Come on!

316
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:49,500
Belle.

317
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,271
There's nothing you could
have done to save me.

318
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:56,707
You died for me.

319
00:37:58,943 --> 00:37:59,844
No.

320
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:02,780
I died because
I had a weak heart.

321
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,986
What is this?

322
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:12,857
Don't let the darkness
get to you.

323
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:17,728
It will harden your soul
and erode your emotions.

324
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:41,786
You're next.

325
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:46,424
Your turn.

326
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:47,591
For what?

327
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:50,995
Take off your clothes.

328
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:53,798
Slowly.

329
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:55,933
Sensually.

330
00:38:58,102 --> 00:38:59,570
Like a stripper?

331
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,407
That would be nice.

332
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,344
Uh...

333
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:14,485
Start.

334
00:39:17,988 --> 00:39:19,357
Now!
Okay!

335
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:31,836
That's right.

336
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:48,753
There we go.

337
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:36,644
Okay! Sorry!

338
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:38,170
Sorry! I... I'm sorry!

339
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,697
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

340
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:41,632
Stop!

341
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:44,685
I won't...

342
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,854
Stop! Stop! No!

343
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,839
Let her go!

344
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:52,710
And you're next.

345
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:56,013
You want me
to dance for you?

346
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,256
You're going to be doing it for her.
Stop! Stop!

347
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:06,824
Stop!
You're gonna...

348
00:42:06,974 --> 00:42:07,791
Please!

349
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:34,818
Stop.

350
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:36,954
Watch.

351
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:41,025
Stop!

352
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:42,860
Stop!

353
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:51,869
Kiss her.

354
00:42:57,675 --> 00:42:58,809
Give another kiss.

355
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:08,018
Mmm.
Yes. She likes that.

356
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,058
Enjoy.

357
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:20,047
Stop. Stop.

358
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:21,599
You're still
helping your friend.

359
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:24,960
Still helping her.

360
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:26,904
Go on. She likes it.

361
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,073
You want to make her happy.

362
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:32,376
Stop. Stop. Stop.

363
00:43:57,234 --> 00:43:58,202
Jim?

364
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:02,773
Jim!

365
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:06,176
Oh, Jim!

366
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:13,851
Jim.

367
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:15,886
Jim.

368
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:18,255
No, Jim.

369
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,991
No, Jim.

370
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:23,427
No.

371
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:24,955
Oh, yeah.

372
00:45:26,256 --> 00:45:27,391
Oh, yeah.

373
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:30,461
No! No! No!

374
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:32,763
Now you're going down.

375
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,851
Where are you
going? Huh?

376
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:41,589
Huh? Where are you going?
Huh?

377
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:42,873
Where are you
going? Huh?

378
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:44,475
No!

379
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:47,144
No! No!

380
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:49,697
Huh? Where you going?

381
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:51,315
Come here! Come here!
No!

382
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:53,217
Let's get
comfortable, huh?

383
00:45:53,367 --> 00:45:54,852
No!
Get 'em off!

384
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:55,753
Please!

385
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,288
Shh.
No, please!

386
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:02,493
Where you going?
Huh?

387
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:05,195
Come here.
We got a runner, don't we?

388
00:46:12,035 --> 00:46:14,104
No! No! Stop!

389
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:16,874
Stop!

390
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:21,311
Take your shirt off! Let's go!
Come on! Someone help me!

391
00:46:21,461 --> 00:46:22,946
Let's see
what you got, huh?

392
00:46:23,096 --> 00:46:24,414
No! No!

393
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,419
No! Please! Take these off her.
Can't leave these on.

394
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:19,429
Shh.

395
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:21,231
It's okay.

396
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:30,274
It's okay.
Look at me. No.

397
00:48:30,424 --> 00:48:31,241
Look at me.
No.

398
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:32,976
Look at me.

399
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:35,479
Look at me!

400
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:40,384
I love you.

401
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:43,620
Come here.

402
00:48:44,388 --> 00:48:45,923
Stand. Come here.

403
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:52,529
Upsy-daisy.

404
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:55,132
There we go.
Come here.

405
00:49:03,206 --> 00:49:04,274
Shh.

406
00:49:11,348 --> 00:49:12,349
Look at me.

407
00:49:14,051 --> 00:49:15,986
Look at me.
Look at me.

408
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:17,587
Huh? See,
it's not bad.

409
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:23,210
No.
Wanna dance?

410
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:26,163
No. No.
"Yes. Yes. Yes."

411
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:30,467
Well, okay then.
Let's dance.

412
00:49:30,617 --> 00:49:32,269
No.

413
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:29,636
Come on, baby!
Whoo!

414
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:32,522
There we go!
Yeah! Whoo!

415
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:41,698
Fight for that air, baby!

416
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:44,334
Fly for Mr. Red!

417
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:47,087
Yeah, huh?

418
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:48,271
Hang, baby, hang!
There you go! There you go!

419
00:51:48,421 --> 00:51:49,256
You look pretty.

420
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:52,375
Come on. Hang 'em up!
Hang 'em up!

421
00:51:59,249 --> 00:52:00,183
No!

422
00:52:05,722 --> 00:52:07,365
Whoo! Woo-hoo!

423
00:52:07,515 --> 00:52:09,159
Baby! Whoo!

424
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:21,446
Whoo! Yeah!

425
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:22,689
No!

426
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:24,591
There you go.
How's it feel, huh?

427
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:26,409
Just wanna join the party,
baby, huh?

428
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:56,800
Shh.

429
00:54:46,483 --> 00:54:47,517
No!

430
00:55:09,572 --> 00:55:10,774
Huh? Come on!

431
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:13,476
Hey, yo, Red?

432
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:25,922
Hey, you see him?

433
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:27,791
No. I don't see him.

434
00:55:30,393 --> 00:55:31,027
Hey, yo, Red?

435
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:36,032
The fuck?

436
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:41,838
Fuck.

437
00:56:11,401 --> 00:56:12,469
Drop your gun
on the floor.

438
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,042
I will kill her.

439
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:20,844
Then I'll kill you.

440
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:27,717
Open your eyes.

441
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:35,158
All right.

442
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:36,593
Say goodbye
to your friend.

443
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:42,832
Don't.

444
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:44,709
Don't do it.

445
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:45,835
Too fast.

446
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:47,971
Not enough pain.

447
00:56:55,011 --> 00:56:58,448
Listen to
what she says.

448
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:01,684
It's not worth it.

449
00:57:11,995 --> 00:57:13,096
Thank you.

450
00:57:18,635 --> 00:57:19,702
Soon enough...

451
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,138
you'll wish you were dead.

452
00:57:36,085 --> 00:57:37,053
Kay.

453
00:57:37,554 --> 00:57:39,022
Kay.

454
00:57:39,155 --> 00:57:40,381
Kay.
No.

455
00:57:40,531 --> 00:57:41,608
No!
Kay.

456
00:57:41,758 --> 00:57:43,993
Kay, it's me. It's me.
It's me. No! No! Get off!

457
00:57:44,143 --> 00:57:45,161
It's me. It's me.
It's me. It's me. No!

458
00:57:45,311 --> 00:57:47,497
No! Ow! Ow.

459
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:51,000
They're not gonna
hurt us anymore.

460
00:58:11,054 --> 00:58:12,655
We're not alone,
you know.

461
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:15,692
You will regret this.

462
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:18,228
The other two
are in the basement.

463
00:58:33,977 --> 00:58:35,044
They're out there...

464
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:36,946
watching.

465
00:58:38,982 --> 00:58:39,916
See this?

466
00:58:41,784 --> 00:58:43,052
This is live feed.

467
00:58:44,554 --> 00:58:47,223
They're coming
any moment now.

468
00:58:47,373 --> 00:58:49,225
And all of...
Shh.

469
00:58:49,375 --> 00:58:51,895
Shh.

470
00:59:13,249 --> 00:59:14,017
What the fuck?

471
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:25,828
What is
your real name?

472
00:59:28,932 --> 00:59:29,966
Fuck you.

473
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:33,002
Excellent.

474
00:59:33,136 --> 00:59:35,271
Mr. Fuck You,
welcome to the party.

475
00:59:42,211 --> 00:59:44,764
Maybe, just maybe,

476
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:47,183
I'll spare your life if you
tell me your real name.

477
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:49,752
Don't say shit.

478
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:56,259
What about you?

479
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,298
Three real men.

480
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:04,968
Courageous,
strong, defiant.

481
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:08,605
I like that.

482
01:00:09,172 --> 01:00:11,341
They're coming.

483
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:19,015
Oh, God!

484
01:00:20,917 --> 01:00:23,319
You're going
to die slowly.

485
01:00:24,387 --> 01:00:25,989
That is what
you deserve.

486
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:28,958
No one is coming
to avenge you.

487
01:00:29,993 --> 01:00:31,327
That really just
sounded good.

488
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:47,210
Who is watching us?
I don't... I don't know.

489
01:00:47,744 --> 01:00:49,212
I don't know.
It wasn't part of the deal.

490
01:00:49,362 --> 01:00:50,680
Oh, God!

491
01:00:51,714 --> 01:00:52,749
I don't believe you.

492
01:00:57,186 --> 01:00:58,855
What difference
does it make?

493
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:01,991
None... to me.

494
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:09,065
What are you doing?

495
01:01:12,301 --> 01:01:13,953
My God!
Come on!

496
01:01:14,103 --> 01:01:16,172
Yeah! Fucking bitch!
You fucking bitch!

497
01:01:16,322 --> 01:01:17,273
Fuck. Fuck.

498
01:01:17,707 --> 01:01:19,292
Yeah! Die!

499
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:23,079
Come on!
Fucking bitch! Fuck.

500
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:26,049
Fuck!
I just killed you.

501
01:01:37,427 --> 01:01:38,227
Belle.

502
01:01:42,432 --> 01:01:43,683
What?

503
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:45,034
Are we supposed
to be nice?

504
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:47,220
We should call
the police.

505
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:51,407
No phone.
The nearest house is too far. What...

506
01:01:51,557 --> 01:01:52,775
What do you suggest?

507
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:54,744
We shouldn't do what
they did to us.

508
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:56,079
We're not.

509
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:57,605
We didn't provoke
the events.

510
01:01:57,755 --> 01:01:59,082
We're just
reacting to them.

511
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:01,984
We shouldn't be...

512
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:03,386
Angela, shut up.

513
01:02:04,821 --> 01:02:05,488
It's not right.

514
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:10,326
They just raped you!

515
01:02:11,828 --> 01:02:12,762
I got...

516
01:02:16,099 --> 01:02:17,200
For what?

517
01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:24,006
For what?

518
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,892
Fuck! I'm sorry.

519
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:27,885
So you can make
your own snuff movie?

520
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:29,879
No. No. No. No.
No. No. I'm sorry.

521
01:02:30,029 --> 01:02:30,813
Do it.
Please.

522
01:02:30,963 --> 01:02:32,131
No. No.

523
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:36,352
Please. I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

524
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,204
Do it.
I'm sorry. Please.

525
01:02:38,354 --> 01:02:40,456
Please, please, please. Don't do it.
Don't do it. Don't do it.

526
01:02:40,606 --> 01:02:42,208
No! No! No!
Please! Please!

527
01:02:42,358 --> 01:02:44,168
I'm sorry.
Don't do it. Do it!

528
01:02:44,318 --> 01:02:46,129
Please. Please.
Please. Please.

529
01:02:46,279 --> 01:02:47,380
Fuck! Don't do it.

530
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:49,749
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

531
01:02:49,899 --> 01:02:51,934
I'm so fucking...
Please! Please!

532
01:02:53,503 --> 01:02:56,272
What? "I'm sorry",
and all is forgotten?

533
01:02:56,422 --> 01:02:57,406
I can't believe it.

534
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,809
Nothing is forgotten!

535
01:03:00,143 --> 01:03:01,344
Stop! He's dying!

536
01:03:02,545 --> 01:03:04,046
Look, I'll tell you
everything I know.

537
01:03:05,081 --> 01:03:06,249
Okay? Which isn't much.

538
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:08,518
I'll take not much.

539
01:03:15,525 --> 01:03:16,425
My name is...

540
01:03:18,327 --> 01:03:19,362
Paul Collins.

541
01:03:20,363 --> 01:03:21,531
Okay?
I don't know theirs!

542
01:03:24,867 --> 01:03:26,803
Look,
we met for the first time this afternoon.

543
01:03:28,004 --> 01:03:29,238
It was all preplanned.

544
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:32,208
And... And he's right.

545
01:03:32,508 --> 01:03:35,278
The paint, the GoPro,
it was in a mailbox.

546
01:03:36,345 --> 01:03:38,881
And then you
killed old Jim?

547
01:03:39,031 --> 01:03:39,966
No! No, we didn't!

548
01:03:40,116 --> 01:03:41,951
We weren't even
supposed to shoot at you!

549
01:03:43,853 --> 01:03:46,022
Look, all we had to do
was scare you...

550
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:49,392
play with you
as much as we wanted,

551
01:03:49,542 --> 01:03:50,927
and leave you here...

552
01:03:52,395 --> 01:03:53,296
drugged.

553
01:03:54,063 --> 01:03:55,164
Drugged?

554
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:58,000
Yeah.

555
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:00,837
Look in my pocket.

556
01:04:11,414 --> 01:04:12,548
See? You gotta believe me.

557
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:19,222
I do.

558
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:21,457
I do.

559
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:23,893
You do?

560
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:28,331
Okay, so, what are
you gonna do with us?

561
01:04:39,909 --> 01:04:41,869
Eye for an eye.
No. No. No.

562
01:04:42,019 --> 01:04:43,980
Fuck, no! Please!
Fuck.

563
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:46,382
Please.

564
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:52,989
Come on. Faster!

565
01:04:54,957 --> 01:04:55,925
Come on. Move!

566
01:04:56,075 --> 01:04:56,659
Go!

567
01:04:58,027 --> 01:04:58,594
Move!

568
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:01,230
I like the way
you're thinking.

569
01:05:03,432 --> 01:05:04,283
Get in.

570
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:06,502
Come on. Shh.

571
01:05:09,972 --> 01:05:10,907
Come here.

572
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:13,109
There you go.

573
01:05:22,618 --> 01:05:24,353
It's been a good companion
of mine.

574
01:05:26,122 --> 01:05:28,024
Too bad I'll have to
trash it after this.

575
01:05:29,158 --> 01:05:31,027
On the bed.
Get on the bed! No! No!

576
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:31,928
Come on!
On the bed!

577
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,335
For you.
No! No!

578
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:41,437
Here!
Come here!

579
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:48,444
So, Mr. Red.

580
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:50,413
Wanna do us the honors?

581
01:05:55,217 --> 01:05:56,269
This has to stop!

582
01:05:56,419 --> 01:05:57,720
No, you gotta stop.

583
01:06:00,656 --> 01:06:01,390
Belle.

584
01:06:02,558 --> 01:06:04,293
Belle. Belle.

585
01:06:05,594 --> 01:06:06,495
It's me.

586
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:08,998
Please.

587
01:06:09,432 --> 01:06:10,433
It's Ange.

588
01:06:12,601 --> 01:06:14,003
Are you really
gonna kill me?

589
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:21,577
Wait.

590
01:06:25,548 --> 01:06:27,616
Wait! Wait!
No, don't open the door!

591
01:06:27,766 --> 01:06:29,335
David!
- There's no David!

592
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:31,620
What if?
You're all going crazy!

593
01:06:31,770 --> 01:06:32,688
No, no.
Please, no.

594
01:06:32,838 --> 01:06:34,073
Wait.
No!

595
01:06:34,223 --> 01:06:36,192
Talk to me. No!
No, no, no, no, please!

596
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:49,171
What the fuck?

597
01:06:52,475 --> 01:06:54,410
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

598
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:31,714
Hey, come on.

599
01:07:32,481 --> 01:07:33,416
Okay.

600
01:07:36,485 --> 01:07:38,487
Almost there.
Come on.

601
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:40,556
Hurry up.
Okay.

602
01:07:51,834 --> 01:07:53,569
You didn't wanna kill us.
Is that what you said?

603
01:08:06,816 --> 01:08:08,384
I hope you're enjoying
this show.

604
01:08:15,391 --> 01:08:16,309
Come on!

605
01:08:16,459 --> 01:08:18,227
Move it!
Stop! Please!

606
01:08:21,197 --> 01:08:22,098
Please! Okay!

607
01:08:22,248 --> 01:08:23,165
Okay!

608
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:26,335
So?

609
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:29,538
No. No! No!

610
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:32,508
Do it.

611
01:08:33,542 --> 01:08:34,610
No more, please.
Start!

612
01:08:36,345 --> 01:08:38,481
I'm sorry!

613
01:08:39,548 --> 01:08:42,318
Oh, no!

614
01:08:43,152 --> 01:08:44,220
Oh, no!

615
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,259
I'm sorry!

616
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:57,666
Say "Hi"
to Mr. David.

617
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:01,437
"Hi."
- Hi!

618
01:09:01,871 --> 01:09:02,755
"Mister."

619
01:09:02,905 --> 01:09:04,573
"David"!
David!

620
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:06,734
Hi, Mr. David.

621
01:09:06,884 --> 01:09:08,144
Pathetic.

622
01:09:13,349 --> 01:09:14,700
Oh, God!
Shut up!

623
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:16,819
Please. Please.
Please.

624
01:09:16,969 --> 01:09:18,220
Shut up!

625
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:19,705
You gotta stop.
This...

626
01:09:19,855 --> 01:09:21,390
You gotta stop!
...is for Angela!

627
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:22,324
No!

628
01:09:24,527 --> 01:09:27,288
No! No!

629
01:09:27,438 --> 01:09:30,049
Fuck! Stop!

630
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:32,635
No! No, please!
This is for...

631
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:57,526
Listen to me carefully.

632
01:09:59,795 --> 01:10:01,197
Whoever is out there...

633
01:10:02,731 --> 01:10:04,233
doesn't care
about any of us.

634
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:05,968
Including you.

635
01:10:08,337 --> 01:10:09,905
He would already
have saved you if he did.

636
01:10:12,808 --> 01:10:13,876
You have no choice.

637
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:24,887
Let's get
out of here.

638
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:35,264
Here's the plan.

639
01:10:37,433 --> 01:10:39,802
Lory, you sneak out from
the window in the basement.

640
01:10:40,669 --> 01:10:42,571
Try to get help
any way you can.

641
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:47,610
Red, Kay,
and I will try to create a diversion.

642
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,745
Red, I'm gonna
trust you with a gun.

643
01:10:51,847 --> 01:10:53,816
Remember,
we're not the enemy.

644
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:58,020
Whatever is the amount of
money they promised you,

645
01:10:58,654 --> 01:11:00,623
they never intended
to pay it.

646
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:17,973
Don't you dare touch me!
Stand back!

647
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:12,494
What?

648
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:16,765
He cut Lory's head off.

649
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:19,585
No!

650
01:12:19,735 --> 01:12:21,570
No, no, no.

651
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:24,540
No, it's impossible.
No, it's impossible.

652
01:12:25,607 --> 01:12:26,775
No.

653
01:12:27,776 --> 01:12:29,011
No.

654
01:12:45,594 --> 01:12:46,895
We're gonna make it.

655
01:12:47,596 --> 01:12:48,731
I promise.

656
01:12:50,766 --> 01:12:51,900
He's not gonna get us.

657
01:12:58,574 --> 01:12:59,508
How?

658
01:13:14,923 --> 01:13:15,824
Perfect.

659
01:13:22,598 --> 01:13:23,399
Okay.

660
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:11,513
There must be a reason
for whoever's doing this.

661
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:14,550
Anyone in college
we hurt?

662
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:19,755
Anyone who wants to buy
this house for cheap.

663
01:14:19,905 --> 01:14:20,806
I don't know.
Kay.

664
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:22,191
I know, I know,
I know.

665
01:14:23,058 --> 01:14:24,059
That was stupid.

666
01:14:28,597 --> 01:14:30,799
Have you ever witnessed
pure evil?

667
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:36,872
I wanted to write
about it...

668
01:14:40,242 --> 01:14:41,710
but I didn't even
know what it meant.

669
01:14:45,013 --> 01:14:46,248
Not until tonight.

670
01:14:49,051 --> 01:14:50,052
I did.

671
01:14:55,691 --> 01:14:57,226
Don't let the darkness
get to you.

672
01:14:58,694 --> 01:15:01,964
It will harden your soul
and erode your emotions.

673
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:11,039
Belle?

674
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:19,281
Belle!

675
01:15:21,884 --> 01:15:23,118
You got me worried.

676
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:26,088
You were far away.

677
01:15:29,124 --> 01:15:31,026
I was just thinking
of my father.

678
01:16:03,959 --> 01:16:05,227
I was thinking...

679
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:08,063
These old basements,
they usually have, like,

680
01:16:08,213 --> 01:16:10,032
a crawlspace
under the house.

681
01:16:14,036 --> 01:16:15,137
I don't know.

682
01:16:27,783 --> 01:16:29,426
No! No! No! No!
Wait. Wait. Wait.

683
01:16:29,576 --> 01:16:31,219
No. We have to find
another way.

684
01:16:45,801 --> 01:16:47,302
Holy shit. Okay, go.

685
01:17:10,192 --> 01:17:11,226
There's something there.

686
01:17:29,077 --> 01:17:30,078
Oh, my God.

687
01:17:30,879 --> 01:17:31,813
We gotta go.

688
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:42,424
You were supposed
to just have fun.

689
01:17:44,292 --> 01:17:46,094
It didn't work out
that way.

690
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:49,064
No, it didn't.

691
01:17:50,766 --> 01:17:52,267
Who the fuck are you?

692
01:17:56,038 --> 01:17:58,974
You would have killed us any...
anyway.

693
01:17:59,124 --> 01:17:59,975
Maybe.

694
01:18:00,308 --> 01:18:03,595
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

695
01:18:03,745 --> 01:18:05,213
How does it feel, huh?

696
01:19:10,445 --> 01:19:11,346
Oh, my God.

697
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:14,349
Go!
I'm trying!

698
01:19:17,385 --> 01:19:19,821
I'm trying.
I'm trying. Oh, God.

699
01:19:19,971 --> 01:19:21,490
Oh, he's coming!
Please!

700
01:19:31,933 --> 01:19:32,467
Oh, shit.

701
01:19:33,869 --> 01:19:35,370
Okay, almost there.
Hold on.

702
01:19:46,481 --> 01:19:47,415
Hold on.

703
01:19:50,986 --> 01:19:52,053
I hear him!

704
01:19:54,322 --> 01:19:56,291
Okay, grab my hand!
Grab my hand!

705
01:19:56,441 --> 01:19:58,676
Get off of me!
Go! Go! Go!

706
01:19:58,826 --> 01:20:01,062
Grab my hand.
Come on.

707
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:02,931
Grab my hand.

708
01:20:05,967 --> 01:20:07,369
Come on.
Come on.

709
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:30,992
Let's stay here.

710
01:20:46,107 --> 01:20:47,108
Now.

711
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:00,155
Belle. Belle!

712
01:21:00,956 --> 01:21:01,857
Wait!

713
01:21:03,925 --> 01:21:04,860
Belle!

714
01:21:06,027 --> 01:21:07,195
Shit.

715
01:21:14,069 --> 01:21:15,537
How long should we play this game,
huh?

716
01:21:16,504 --> 01:21:17,339
You're trapped.

717
01:21:21,009 --> 01:21:23,545
How about I spare the life
of the first one to come out?

718
01:21:27,649 --> 01:21:29,017
Gonna get you
either way!

719
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:38,393
Now!

720
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:40,161
Now!

721
01:22:49,698 --> 01:22:51,700
I think...
I think we're okay.

722
01:23:11,619 --> 01:23:12,420
What?

723
01:23:17,192 --> 01:23:18,493
We made it.

724
01:23:20,028 --> 01:23:21,062
We did.

725
01:23:25,266 --> 01:23:26,468
We made it.

726
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:31,339
We're not far away.

727
01:23:53,128 --> 01:23:54,512
"And that night,

728
01:23:54,662 --> 01:23:59,234
I realized that there was no such thing
as a boundary between good or evil,

729
01:23:59,567 --> 01:24:02,137
black and white,
right or wrong.

730
01:24:03,071 --> 01:24:05,407
All I learned
is that this world

731
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:09,477
is divided by the executed
and executioners."

732
01:24:11,079 --> 01:24:11,679
Hm.

733
01:24:18,253 --> 01:24:19,354
So?

734
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:21,790
What do you think?

735
01:24:23,792 --> 01:24:25,093
Well,
it's not Shakespeare...

736
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:26,561
or Styron.

737
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:30,665
It's certainly not Cormac
McCarthy or J.K. Rowling.

738
01:24:34,135 --> 01:24:35,203
You know...

739
01:24:37,405 --> 01:24:38,473
your proofreader
did a good job.

740
01:24:40,642 --> 01:24:42,310
I was right
about your first book.

741
01:24:42,610 --> 01:24:44,479
It was a piece of crap,
and it sold nil.

742
01:24:47,715 --> 01:24:48,817
I really thought
your career was over.

743
01:24:50,118 --> 01:24:51,002
Okay.

744
01:24:51,152 --> 01:24:53,321
And what do you think
about this one?

745
01:24:54,255 --> 01:24:55,723
Not great either.

746
01:24:58,293 --> 01:24:59,227
But...

747
01:25:01,162 --> 01:25:02,464
It's gonna make
a lot of money.

748
01:25:03,331 --> 01:25:04,049
And as you well know...

749
01:25:04,199 --> 01:25:07,702
wealth gives you the ability
to fully experience life.

750
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:11,673
That's Henry David Thoreau.
Sure.

751
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:14,542
So... you like it?

752
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:17,145
Not a bit.
But I'd be crazy not to publish it.

753
01:25:17,345 --> 01:25:19,714
Yeah.
You would say the same thing about the Bible.

754
01:25:20,215 --> 01:25:21,216
Probably.

755
01:25:22,484 --> 01:25:23,384
Is this all true?

756
01:25:23,885 --> 01:25:24,853
Yes.

757
01:25:26,421 --> 01:25:27,555
It was
in the newspapers.

758
01:25:29,357 --> 01:25:30,658
How... How do you feel?

759
01:25:33,228 --> 01:25:33,828
Better.

760
01:25:37,398 --> 01:25:38,600
Writing was cathartic.

761
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:45,840
That's why I wrote "A true story",
not "Based on."

762
01:25:46,608 --> 01:25:48,910
Yeah, no, I, uh...
I got the nuance.

763
01:25:49,677 --> 01:25:52,180
So did they ever prove
Belle did it?

764
01:25:55,316 --> 01:25:57,152
She has never
been the same

765
01:25:57,552 --> 01:25:59,287
since her father died.

766
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:05,493
Well, I'll give you this: You got an
amazing gift for capturing details.

767
01:26:06,895 --> 01:26:08,530
I will never forget
a second of it.

768
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:12,167
It's all recorded...

769
01:26:13,868 --> 01:26:14,435
in here.

770
01:26:54,375 --> 01:26:55,410
Do you have it?

771
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:00,748
It's all there.

772
01:27:01,416 --> 01:27:02,300
Not so fast.

773
01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:05,653
Everything that happened last
night is recorded in here.

774
01:27:19,667 --> 01:27:21,636
I trust the second half of
the payment will be there.

775
01:27:21,786 --> 01:27:22,821
Trust me.

776
01:27:22,971 --> 01:27:24,472
You'll be very satisfied.

777
01:27:30,278 --> 01:27:31,579
Can I ask you
why you did it?

778
01:27:41,322 --> 01:27:43,391
I'll have to kill you
if I tell you.

779
01:27:50,798 --> 01:27:52,433
Now that I think
about it...

780
01:27:54,769 --> 01:27:56,404
I have to kill you
anyway.
