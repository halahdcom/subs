00:02:40,032 --> 00:02:41,265
Ms. Eskel?

21
00:02:41,267 --> 00:02:43,367
Yeah, hi.
I'm Spencer Stone's mother.

22
00:02:43,369 --> 00:02:45,369
This is Heidi,
Alek Skarlatos' mom.

23
00:02:45,371 --> 00:02:49,908
Oh. I'm sorry, I didn't think
we were meeting until 3:15.

24
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,676
Yes. Well, um,

25
00:02:51,678 --> 00:02:55,279
we had some similar concerns.
So...

26
00:02:55,281 --> 00:02:58,116
Thought we'd join forces.
(CHUCKLES)

00:02:58,118 --> 00:02:59,415
Um, well, I...

28
00:02:59,417 --> 00:03:01,018
We're concerned, I guess,

29
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,187
with the boys
starting junior high.

30
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:04,821
- Rightfully so.
- JOYCE: Yeah.

31
00:03:04,823 --> 00:03:06,456
Uh, we've noticed
some bullying

32
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,659
with the classmates,

33
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:09,226
and we were worried
it might be

34
00:03:09,228 --> 00:03:10,628
affecting their school work.

35
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,767
Ms. Eskel. Ms. Skarlatos.
May I be quite frank?

36
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:17,402
Spencer is behind
on his reading.

37
00:03:17,404 --> 00:03:18,635
Very behind.

38
00:03:18,637 --> 00:03:22,006
And Alek is
too easily distracted.

39
00:03:22,008 --> 00:03:24,946
Has anyone ever discussed
ADD with you two?

40
00:03:25,512 --> 00:03:27,010
In my opinion,

41
00:03:27,012 --> 00:03:28,580
both Spencer and Alek suffer
from something called

42
00:03:28,582 --> 00:03:31,683
Attention Deficit Disorder,
ADD.

43
00:03:31,685 --> 00:03:33,316
Do you think that
you might be jumping

44
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:34,851
to this conclusion
too quickly?

45
00:03:34,853 --> 00:03:37,121
It's not a quick jump,
Ms. Eskel.

46
00:03:37,123 --> 00:03:38,422
As I previously mentioned,

47
00:03:38,424 --> 00:03:40,558
Spencer cannot concentrate
on his reading.

48
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,992
JOYCE: Well,
that might be my fault.

49
00:03:41,994 --> 00:03:43,928
Now that I know
he's falling behind, I can...

50
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,198
And Alek spends most of his
day staring out the window.

51
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,201
I'm sorry. Did you say that
Alek "looks out the window"?

52
00:03:51,203 --> 00:03:53,070
Yes.

53
00:03:53,072 --> 00:03:54,806
Just so I'm clear,

54
00:03:54,808 --> 00:03:57,842
do the other kids
not look out the window?

55
00:03:57,844 --> 00:04:00,344
There are things you can do
to help them focus.

56
00:04:00,346 --> 00:04:01,612
There are myriad medications

57
00:04:01,614 --> 00:04:02,546
out there
that will significantly...

58
00:04:02,548 --> 00:04:03,848
Medications?

59
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,349
- Joyce, it's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

60
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:06,884
I'm sorry. I'm just trying
to pinpoint you.

61
00:04:06,886 --> 00:04:09,386
So, you're telling me that
I need to drug my child

62
00:04:09,388 --> 00:04:10,887
to make your job easier.

63
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:12,990
These medications
will help them focus,

64
00:04:12,992 --> 00:04:15,429
and it would be easier
for the boys...

65
00:04:16,661 --> 00:04:18,328
If you don't
medicate them now,

66
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,330
they'll just
self-medicate later.

67
00:04:20,332 --> 00:04:21,765
Do you think
this is a good solution?

68
00:04:21,767 --> 00:04:23,570
Throwing pills at a problem?

69
00:04:24,603 --> 00:04:25,972
Then let's go.

70
00:04:27,772 --> 00:04:31,275
You know, boys of single moms,
it's just statistics.

71
00:04:31,277 --> 00:04:32,609
But statistically,

72
00:04:32,611 --> 00:04:34,948
they are more likely
to develop problems.

73
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:40,049
My God is bigger
than your statistics,

74
00:04:40,051 --> 00:04:42,455
so I don't really care
what you have to say anymore.

switching me
to a Christian school.

Only a full day later.

481
00:23:37,255 --> 00:23:38,388
What happened?

482
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,889
Alek, man.

483
00:23:39,891 --> 00:23:41,792
I texted him some big news,
like, eight hours ago,

484
00:23:41,794 --> 00:23:42,859
and he's just
getting back to me

485
00:23:42,861 --> 00:23:44,293
with this lukewarm response.

486
00:23:44,295 --> 00:23:45,828
What was the big news?

487
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,362
Oh, I'm gonna try out
for the Air Force Pararescue.

488
00:23:47,364 --> 00:23:51,700
Oh. Man, that's, uh...
That's great. For real?

489
00:23:51,702 --> 00:23:54,403
You're gonna join
the Air Force now, huh?

490
00:23:54,405 --> 00:23:56,605
Okay.
So what's that about?

491
00:23:56,607 --> 00:23:58,274
What's what about?

492
00:23:58,276 --> 00:24:02,378
How come no one's hearing this
as life-changing information?

493
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:05,150
I don't know, man. Maybe...
Maybe 'cause it's you.

494
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,951
What does that even mean?

495
00:24:07,953 --> 00:24:10,419
I mean, not to say anything
against you or anything,

496
00:24:10,421 --> 00:24:11,755
but you kind of
got to be in shape

497
00:24:11,757 --> 00:24:13,290
to be in the military,
you know?

498
00:24:13,292 --> 00:24:16,391
Come on. So I gotta lose
some weight. So what?

499
00:24:16,393 --> 00:24:18,561
I mean, it's not just that.
What about your motivation?

500
00:24:18,563 --> 00:24:20,729
You quit football
to play basketball.

501
00:24:20,731 --> 00:24:22,198
Then you quit basketball

502
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,999
because you weren't getting
enough playing time.

503
00:24:24,001 --> 00:24:27,269
Okay. So you don't think
I can do it, then?

no one thinks you can't do it.

00:24:30,942 --> 00:24:32,644
We just don't think you will.

507
00:24:33,947 --> 00:24:35,247
Okay.

00:24:39,517 --> 00:24:42,051

585
00:28:30,515 --> 00:28:31,715

to get involved.

587
00:28:32,985 --> 00:28:35,017
Exactly.
I just wanted to help.

At least before I could say

591
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:41,858
it's because
I hadn't really tried.

592
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,860
Now I can't even say that.

593

846
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,348
SPENCER: But I thought
I needed to get

847
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:46,982
an airway in.
He needs to breathe, right?

848
00:40:46,984 --> 00:40:48,650
You do. But did you notice
that our friend here

849
00:40:48,652 --> 00:40:50,018
has clear fluid in his ears?

850
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,187
What might that clear
fluid be, Mr. Stone?

851
00:40:52,189 --> 00:40:53,821
SPENCER: Oh, shit.

852
00:40:53,823 --> 00:40:56,257
Not quite. Guess again.

853
00:40:56,259 --> 00:40:57,324
Spinal fluid, ma'am.

854
00:40:57,326 --> 00:40:58,826
Correct. Spinal fluid.

855
00:40:58,828 --> 00:41:00,828
And if your friend has
spinal fluid in his ears,

856
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:02,063
what does that tell us?

857
00:41:02,065 --> 00:41:03,565
He could have damage
to his skull.

858
00:41:03,567 --> 00:41:05,433
Okay. So, to recap.

859
00:41:05,435 --> 00:41:06,868
You just walked up
to a guy who was

860
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:08,636
already having a pretty
bad day to begin with

861
00:41:08,638 --> 00:41:11,239
and you shove a piece of
silicone into his brain.

862
00:41:11,241 --> 00:41:12,641
You just lobotomized him.

863
00:41:12,643 --> 00:41:14,676
Well, I figured I'd get that
in first so he could breathe

864
00:41:14,678 --> 00:41:16,478
and then I'd move on to his
other stuff.

865
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,679
Okay, but sometimes you need

866
00:41:17,681 --> 00:41:19,047
to deal with
the bleeding first.

867
00:41:19,049 --> 00:41:20,315

a tourniquet on it, then?

Not always.

869
00:41:21,585 --> 00:41:23,085
What if the wound
was on the neck, say?

870
00:41:23,087 --> 00:41:25,853
A tourniquet on the neck
is better known as a noose.

871
00:41:25,855 --> 00:41:27,022
What do I do, then?

872
00:41:27,024 --> 00:41:29,391
In that case,
you say a prayer.

creative occurs to you.

those pretzels?

Oh, my God. They look so good.

1112
00:51:31,194 --> 00:51:32,826
So is it everything
you dreamed?

1113
00:51:32,828 --> 00:51:35,565
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
This is amazing.

which table was his?

1115

Ah, I'm not sure
if he had a table per se,

1116
00:51:40,636 --> 00:51:42,170
but if I know
my Grandpa Nick...

1117
00:51:42,172 --> 00:51:43,404
- Yeah.
- Probably would have

1118

to tell me the story?

much of a story.

everyone has a story

is that about

sixty-two years ago,
my grandpa sat right here.

- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1134

and celebrated
getting his stripes.

- Yeah.

No. No. Uh, American.
He, uh...

1139
00:52:28,652 --> 00:52:30,384
He was raised in New York,

1140
00:52:30,386 --> 00:52:32,422
and he was stationed here
during World War II.

Okay, so, here you are.

Following in his footsteps.

1143
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:40,495
Yeah. I guess so, in a way.

1144

I'm so happy that you're here.

a picture of me?

Hell no.
I'm tired from this heat,

1153

and those eight thousand miles
you made us walk today.

1154

to use a selfie stick,

and stick out even more
than we already are.

Don't ask.

are you up to?
