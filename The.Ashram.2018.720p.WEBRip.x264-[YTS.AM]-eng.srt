00:00:39,955 --> 00:00:42,891
- Hi-yah!

Subtitles by explosiveskull

3
00:00:53,769 --> 00:00:56,739
Any changes in vision
or hearing?

4
00:01:00,775 --> 00:01:02,575
No.

5
00:01:02,577 --> 00:01:06,279
What about the headaches?
Are the meds helping at all?

6
00:01:06,281 --> 00:01:09,950
Look... the reason I came in
here is 'cause I remember

7
00:01:09,952 --> 00:01:13,320
you saying before
that altitude was a bad idea.

8
00:01:13,322 --> 00:01:16,957
It is. At high altitudes,

9
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:19,626
your symptoms will get worse.

10
00:01:19,628 --> 00:01:22,462
Headaches, seizures,

11
00:01:22,464 --> 00:01:24,798
loss of consciousness even.

12
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,433
Yeah.

13
00:01:26,435 --> 00:01:28,802
If there's severe swelling
around the tumour,

14
00:01:28,804 --> 00:01:30,938
it could be fatal.

15
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,641
Yeah.

16
00:01:36,644 --> 00:01:38,478
Don't go, Jamie.

17
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,814
I have to go.

18
00:02:36,037 --> 00:02:38,872
Excuse me.
Hi. Sorry, guys.

19
00:02:38,874 --> 00:02:40,773
I'm looking
for a friend of mine.

20
00:02:40,775 --> 00:02:43,576
Just wondered if you've seen her face?
Her name's Sophie.

21
00:02:43,578 --> 00:02:46,045
- No. Sorry, mate.
- Sorry. I hope you find her.

22
00:02:46,047 --> 00:02:47,649
Thanks.

23
00:02:54,922 --> 00:02:58,759
So we have no choice
but to follow the true way.

24
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,760
We fail to follow this way...

25
00:03:00,762 --> 00:03:04,031
Excuse me.
Sorry to interrupt, guys.

26
00:03:04,033 --> 00:03:06,699
I'm looking for a friend.
She went missing a while back.

27
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:08,034
She may have passed
through here.

28
00:03:08,036 --> 00:03:09,936
I just wanna know
if anybody's seen her.

29
00:03:09,938 --> 00:03:11,604
No, I haven't seen her.

30
00:03:27,155 --> 00:03:29,423
This is the place.

31
00:03:29,425 --> 00:03:31,027
But I don't recognize her.

32
00:03:34,463 --> 00:03:36,962
Do you know this café?
You do?

33
00:03:36,964 --> 00:03:38,799
- Yes.
- Can you take me?

34
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,803
Yes. Ah...

35
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,574
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

36
00:03:50,178 --> 00:03:51,878
<i>It's okay?</i>

37
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,816
Alright. Okay.

38
00:03:58,487 --> 00:04:00,823
Uh, sir, the café.

39
00:05:23,605 --> 00:05:26,673
<i>This place is so beautiful,
Jamie.</i>

40
00:05:26,675 --> 00:05:28,742
And for the first time...

41
00:05:28,744 --> 00:05:32,745
<i>...I'm really getting
to know who I am.</i>

42
00:06:46,954 --> 00:06:49,157
Who is it?

43
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,867
Can I help you, man?

44
00:07:00,869 --> 00:07:03,937
I'm sorry, man. I didn't mean
to barge in like this.

45
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:05,639
I just wanna ask you
a couple questions.

46
00:07:05,641 --> 00:07:06,872
- What's up, man?
- Take it easy.

47
00:07:06,874 --> 00:07:08,742
I... I saw your tattoo.

48
00:07:08,744 --> 00:07:10,877
- I just wanna know where you got 'em.
- Who is it, Jesse?

49
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:13,713
- You have to get out here right now!
- Calm down.

50
00:07:13,715 --> 00:07:15,648
A friend of mine
had the same tattoo.

51
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,249
- Now she's missing.
- This is your problem.

52
00:07:17,251 --> 00:07:20,021
Jesse, stop it.

53
00:07:21,122 --> 00:07:22,788
Breathe, breathe.

54
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:26,192
She had a tattoo.
She's... she's one of them.

55
00:07:26,194 --> 00:07:28,228
One of who?

56
00:07:30,364 --> 00:07:32,201
Her name's Sophie.

57
00:07:34,001 --> 00:07:37,172
- Do you know her?
- Yeah. You're Jamie.

58
00:07:37,905 --> 00:07:41,774
How do you know my name?
Why do you know my name?

59
00:07:41,776 --> 00:07:43,043
You know Sophie.

60
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,877
You know Sophie.

61
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,747
Do you know Sophie?!

62
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:50,783
What happened to her?

63
00:07:50,785 --> 00:07:54,122
Her heart.
They did something to her heart.

64
00:07:56,725 --> 00:07:58,692
Here. Take this!

65
00:07:58,694 --> 00:08:01,194
Be careful out there.

66
00:08:01,196 --> 00:08:02,963
Where do I go?

67
00:08:02,965 --> 00:08:04,697
They won't let her go
so easily.

68
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:06,899
Where? Where?
Tell me where. Where do I go?

69
00:08:06,901 --> 00:08:08,334
Don't tell them anything
about you.

70
00:08:08,336 --> 00:08:10,136
Who do I go?

71
00:08:10,138 --> 00:08:13,372
- Hang on a sec.
- Get out!

72
00:08:13,374 --> 00:08:15,374
- Tell me where to go.
- Get out! Get out!

73
00:08:15,376 --> 00:08:16,875
- No...
- Okay, okay.

74
00:08:16,877 --> 00:08:18,745
You've gotta get her
to a hospital.

75
00:08:18,747 --> 00:08:20,215
Breathe. Come on.

76
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:34,027
I need to go north.

77
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:36,265
- North?
- As far north as I can.

78
00:09:04,892 --> 00:09:09,798
Hey, stop, stop, stop, stop.
Stop, stop. Pull in, pull in.

79
00:09:12,434 --> 00:09:16,436
Why you want to talk
to this man, sir?

80
00:09:16,438 --> 00:09:20,139
I can take you, sir.
Don't worry. Namaste.

81
00:09:21,443 --> 00:09:24,376
Ask him
has he seen this before.

82
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:43,062
- What's he saying?
- Sacred crossing.

83
00:09:43,064 --> 00:09:45,465
Sacred crossing.
What's that mean?

84
00:09:48,837 --> 00:09:52,172
Uh, where two rivers
meet together.

85
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:54,541
Okay. Where? Where?

86
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,514
That place.

87
00:10:02,516 --> 00:10:05,350
Upside. We can go together.

88
00:10:05,352 --> 00:10:08,087
What do you mean,
that place upside? Where?

89
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:09,489
From that road.

90
00:10:09,491 --> 00:10:12,859
Upside from this up
and that place.

91
00:10:12,861 --> 00:10:14,362
Give him the...

92
00:10:20,501 --> 00:10:23,036
Thank you very much.

93
00:10:23,038 --> 00:10:25,304
Thank you. Thank you.

94
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,780
Actually, I think he's crazy.

95
00:10:57,539 --> 00:10:59,341
How long, man?

96
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:04,277
- Sir...
- Huh? Can you fix it?

97
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:06,245
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

98
00:11:06,247 --> 00:11:08,548
- Big problem.
- What's wrong with it?

99
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,183
Sir, you give me money.

100
00:11:11,185 --> 00:11:13,919
I give you... Why?

101
00:11:13,921 --> 00:11:15,522
So that I can fix it.

102
00:11:15,524 --> 00:11:17,426
You give me money.

103
00:11:21,195 --> 00:11:23,428
Here you go, okay?

104
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,230
Not enough, sir.

105
00:11:25,232 --> 00:11:29,402
I don't have that much money
to give you. Okay?

106
00:11:29,404 --> 00:11:32,341
Understand, sir.
Big problem, big money, sir.

107
00:11:36,044 --> 00:11:38,278
Hey. Please...

108
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,216
- Fix the bike.
- Okay, okay.

109
00:11:46,954 --> 00:11:48,456
Hey!!

110
00:12:48,382 --> 00:12:50,585
<i>It's so crazy.</i>

111
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,356
<i>What is?</i>

112
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,322
I've seen this flower before.

113
00:12:57,324 --> 00:12:58,660
I know I have.

114
00:13:00,194 --> 00:13:02,327
Another sign?

115
00:13:02,329 --> 00:13:05,465
I mean this same flower.

116
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:07,667
The same... cliff.

117
00:13:07,669 --> 00:13:09,534
The same moment.

118
00:13:09,536 --> 00:13:13,172
There's signs all around us
that have deeper meaning.

119
00:13:13,174 --> 00:13:15,642
If we choose to see them.

120
00:13:15,644 --> 00:13:17,980
Just like the number 23...

121
00:13:21,683 --> 00:13:23,419
<i>What does it mean?</i>

122
00:13:24,685 --> 00:13:27,552
<i>That we're
on the right track.</i>

123
00:13:27,554 --> 00:13:30,690
Everything we've ever done
in our entire lives

124
00:13:30,692 --> 00:13:34,494
has led us to this exact
moment right now.

125
00:13:34,496 --> 00:13:36,095
Here,

126
00:13:36,097 --> 00:13:38,067
on this cliff together.

127
00:13:39,034 --> 00:13:41,069
It's a miracle.

128
00:13:45,173 --> 00:13:47,309
I love you.

129
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,246
You know that, right?

130
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,583
<i>I've always loved you.</i>

131
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,655
<i>And I always will.</i>

132
00:15:09,424 --> 00:15:10,793
Ah!

133
00:16:05,814 --> 00:16:07,712
You must be lost.

134
00:16:07,714 --> 00:16:10,386
Trail is back that way.

135
00:16:13,387 --> 00:16:16,721
I'm told all those who seek
are welcome.

136
00:16:16,723 --> 00:16:18,791
And what is it you seek?

137
00:16:18,793 --> 00:16:20,393
The truth.

138
00:16:20,395 --> 00:16:23,232
The truth takes time,
my friend.

139
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:26,769
Hey, whoa, whoa. Hey! Wait!

140
00:16:28,402 --> 00:16:31,671
You've no idea what I've been
through to get here.

141
00:16:31,673 --> 00:16:33,242
Please!

142
00:17:03,271 --> 00:17:06,404
Hey. Hey. You gonna let me in?

143
00:17:06,406 --> 00:17:09,444
It's freezing out here.
I have no food or water.

144
00:17:11,479 --> 00:17:13,615
Hey, please! No! Wait.

145
00:18:17,345 --> 00:18:18,780
Do you wear these all the time?

146
00:18:34,828 --> 00:18:38,096
As you bring your awareness
back to your breath,

147
00:18:38,098 --> 00:18:42,401
I leave you
with this thought today.

148
00:18:42,403 --> 00:18:45,837
Present, past, future,
thou art I.

149
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:48,342
I am thou, as one.

150
00:18:51,878 --> 00:18:53,381
Wait here.

151
00:19:06,394 --> 00:19:09,598
You certainly don't take no
for an answer.

152
00:19:10,565 --> 00:19:13,399
- I'm Jamie.
- I'm Chandra.

153
00:19:13,401 --> 00:19:15,704
Nice to meet you.

154
00:19:16,838 --> 00:19:19,939
I'm sorry about the wait,
but we do have to separate

155
00:19:19,941 --> 00:19:22,407
the casual seekers from the
serious, you understand.

156
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:26,144
- I do. Truth takes time.
- Hmm.

157
00:19:26,146 --> 00:19:29,749
You're a quick learner.
Come, I'll show you around.

158
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,549
Please.

159
00:19:31,551 --> 00:19:35,755
All the work you see here,
they're all forms of meditation.

160
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:39,924
Connect with them and you connect
with your higher purpose.

161
00:19:39,926 --> 00:19:46,598
We are striving to remain
in balance with our surroundings

162
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,534
in everything we do.

163
00:19:48,536 --> 00:19:50,135
Nitin?

164
00:19:50,137 --> 00:19:51,971
Morning.

165
00:19:51,973 --> 00:19:53,538
This is Jamie.

166
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,807
It's a pleasure to meet you,
brother.

167
00:19:55,809 --> 00:19:57,576
You, too.

168
00:19:57,578 --> 00:20:00,011
- Where you from?
- California.

169
00:20:00,013 --> 00:20:02,147
- I like this guy already.
- You?

170
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:05,651
Cleveland, but you know, we all start
and end in the same place, right?

171
00:20:05,653 --> 00:20:07,452
- Yeah.
- Nitin,

172
00:20:07,454 --> 00:20:10,890
when you're finished here,
will you show Jamie to his room?

173
00:20:10,892 --> 00:20:12,924
Absolutely.
Hope you don't mind

174
00:20:12,926 --> 00:20:14,993
getting your hands dirty.
Welcome.

175
00:20:14,995 --> 00:20:16,662
Thank you.

176
00:20:16,664 --> 00:20:19,468
Nitin helps all the new
arrivals the get situated.

177
00:20:26,907 --> 00:20:30,675
And you don't use any water
from the river?

178
00:20:30,677 --> 00:20:34,480
Oh, absolutely not.
The river is sacred to us.

179
00:20:34,482 --> 00:20:36,715
- Uh-huh.
- People have been coming

180
00:20:36,717 --> 00:20:39,484
to this mountain
for thousands of years,

181
00:20:39,486 --> 00:20:41,487
because it is believed

182
00:20:41,489 --> 00:20:45,891
that the crossing of two rivers
is a sacred place,

183
00:20:45,893 --> 00:20:49,994
where your soul can transcend
to a higher realm.

184
00:20:49,996 --> 00:20:54,967
There are many other realms
of consciousness around us

185
00:20:54,969 --> 00:20:59,141
and this mountain is a doorway
to help you access them.

186
00:21:01,709 --> 00:21:03,976
What brings you here?

187
00:21:03,978 --> 00:21:06,010
How did you know about us?

188
00:21:06,012 --> 00:21:07,546
A friend.

189
00:21:07,548 --> 00:21:09,949
Ah... Who?

190
00:21:09,951 --> 00:21:13,555
Just somebody I met. In town.
On my travels.

191
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:19,258
We're, uh, extremely
out of the way and hard to find,

192
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,960
so I like to know...

193
00:21:20,962 --> 00:21:22,862
No, I get it, you know.

194
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,931
Wouldn't want the secret
to get out. Would we?

195
00:21:25,933 --> 00:21:30,102
Jamie, we do some very hard
work here, inside and out.

196
00:21:30,104 --> 00:21:33,705
And just because you made it
through that gate

197
00:21:33,707 --> 00:21:35,976
doesn't mean you belong here.

198
00:21:40,047 --> 00:21:42,884
Anyway, that's not why
you're here, is it?

199
00:21:46,721 --> 00:21:48,757
You're here for him, aren't you?

200
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,595
Don't worry.
You'll meet him soon enough.

201
00:21:58,265 --> 00:22:00,569
Make yourself at home.

202
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:19,218
<i>Headaches...</i>

203
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,787
<i>Seizures...</i>

204
00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:24,259
- Argh...
- <i>Loss of consciousness...</i>

205
00:22:29,096 --> 00:22:30,766
Ah!

206
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:34,700
<i>Jamie.</i>

207
00:22:34,702 --> 00:22:37,172
- <i>Jamie...</i>
- Oh...

208
00:22:44,611 --> 00:22:46,612
Jamie.

209
00:22:46,614 --> 00:22:48,784
Jamie!

210
00:22:52,118 --> 00:22:55,621
- You okay?
- What time is it?

211
00:22:55,623 --> 00:22:58,660
It's time to roll. Come on.

212
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:07,999
<i>Once we get down there,
just remember to be silent.</i>

213
00:23:08,001 --> 00:23:10,004
<i>Just do what I do.</i>

214
00:23:43,169 --> 00:23:45,069
I know it's your first day.

215
00:23:45,071 --> 00:23:47,208
Try to be on time next time.

216
00:23:52,113 --> 00:23:53,846
Tough love, bro.

217
00:23:53,848 --> 00:23:56,281
Comes from a good place,
though, you know?

218
00:23:56,283 --> 00:23:59,020
She's been through more
than you can imagine.

219
00:24:29,783 --> 00:24:32,353
So what made you become
a seeker?

220
00:24:33,887 --> 00:24:35,820
Something have to make me?

221
00:24:35,822 --> 00:24:38,856
Come on, man. People come
here for two reasons.

222
00:24:38,858 --> 00:24:40,425
They're either running
from something,

223
00:24:40,427 --> 00:24:42,394
or they're running towards it.

224
00:24:42,396 --> 00:24:44,096
Which one are you?

225
00:24:44,098 --> 00:24:45,964
I've been running for years,
man.

226
00:24:45,966 --> 00:24:49,000
I used to try
to turn one dollar into two.

227
00:24:49,002 --> 00:24:51,002
Almost gave myself
a heart attack.

228
00:24:51,004 --> 00:24:55,307
I didn't know how much I was
suffering until it almost killed me.

229
00:24:55,309 --> 00:24:57,442
This place is the real deal,
you know?

230
00:24:57,444 --> 00:25:00,147
You don't really see it until you
start being honest with yourself.

231
00:25:07,788 --> 00:25:10,388
Must be tough,
training the new recruits.

232
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:13,192
Not really. Just you.

233
00:25:13,194 --> 00:25:15,894
Maybe you knew
a friend of mine.

234
00:25:15,896 --> 00:25:18,396
She passed through here
a while back.

235
00:25:18,398 --> 00:25:22,036
- She's American.
- Well... a lot of people pass through here.

236
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:25,674
Her name's Sophie.

237
00:25:27,407 --> 00:25:29,209
Pretty name.

238
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:34,313
Ah, Nitin!

239
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:39,417
Oh, shoot, I'm not ready yet.
Alright, come on.

240
00:25:41,422 --> 00:25:44,390
Uh, Gayatri, this is Jamie,
Jamie, Gayatri. She'll take you.

241
00:25:44,392 --> 00:25:46,892
- So nice to meet you Jamie.
- And you.

242
00:25:46,894 --> 00:25:48,697
Follow me.

243
00:25:52,433 --> 00:25:54,432
Who are all these people?

244
00:25:54,434 --> 00:25:56,300
They're from surrounding
villages.

245
00:25:56,302 --> 00:25:58,806
They've come to receive
Guruji's blessings.

246
00:26:02,276 --> 00:26:05,113
- He's coming.
- Guruji!

247
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,482
Oh!

248
00:27:03,037 --> 00:27:05,306
Guruji.

249
00:27:12,847 --> 00:27:14,980
What's he doing?

250
00:27:14,982 --> 00:27:17,583
He helps people
transcend their pain.

251
00:27:22,056 --> 00:27:24,259
It's amazing, isn't it?

252
00:27:25,492 --> 00:27:28,126
And if it weren't for Guruji,
I'd be dead.

253
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:30,197
What?

254
00:27:31,531 --> 00:27:35,400
Six years ago, I was diagnosed
with stage-four ovarian cancer.

255
00:27:35,402 --> 00:27:39,137
Doctors told me
I had three months to live.

256
00:27:39,139 --> 00:27:42,409
So I made my way up here and...

257
00:27:43,243 --> 00:27:44,578
...he cured me.

258
00:27:46,446 --> 00:27:49,413
- You have cancer?
- Yes.

259
00:27:49,415 --> 00:27:51,418
He cured you of cancer?

260
00:27:52,353 --> 00:27:54,055
You don't believe me.

261
00:27:55,255 --> 00:27:57,291
I think you believe it.

262
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,429
Belief is all we have.

263
00:28:36,463 --> 00:28:39,230
- Hey... Sorry.
- Uh, no, no, no.

264
00:28:39,232 --> 00:28:42,067
Hi, Guru. I'm Jamie.
I just wanted to ask you...

265
00:28:42,069 --> 00:28:44,873
I have been waiting so long
for you, my friend.

266
00:28:49,409 --> 00:28:51,977
Bring her to the library.

267
00:28:51,979 --> 00:28:53,515
Chandra!

268
00:28:54,615 --> 00:28:56,615
- What happened?
- Motorcycle accident.

269
00:28:56,617 --> 00:29:00,618
- One hour ago.
- Take her to the library.

270
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:04,091
- Chandra, what can I do?
- Just nothing right now.

271
00:29:20,473 --> 00:29:22,340
Hey. Is she okay?

272
00:29:56,242 --> 00:29:58,546
<i>Jamie! Jamie...</i>

273
00:30:29,076 --> 00:30:31,076
Jamie?

274
00:30:31,078 --> 00:30:32,711
Are you okay?

275
00:30:32,713 --> 00:30:34,715
Yeah...

276
00:31:14,821 --> 00:31:16,556
<i>Jamie.</i>

277
00:31:20,126 --> 00:31:21,762
Something the matter?

278
00:31:22,762 --> 00:31:24,631
Mountains, uh...

279
00:31:25,566 --> 00:31:27,632
Just the altitude, I guess.

280
00:31:27,634 --> 00:31:29,300
Mm.

281
00:31:29,302 --> 00:31:32,139
It can take some time
to adjust here.

282
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,278
Is she okay?

283
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,780
The little girl?

284
00:31:42,782 --> 00:31:44,548
Yes.

285
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:46,317
Thankfully.

286
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:48,586
What did the old man do?

287
00:31:48,588 --> 00:31:50,825
Guruji.

288
00:31:51,657 --> 00:31:53,328
I'm sorry.

289
00:31:56,496 --> 00:31:58,498
What did Guruji do?

290
00:32:00,166 --> 00:32:02,534
Performed a miracle.

291
00:32:02,536 --> 00:32:03,805
Miracles.

292
00:32:05,172 --> 00:32:08,539
Give them a lot more credit
than they deserve.

293
00:32:08,541 --> 00:32:10,776
Miracles are a matter
of perspective.

294
00:32:10,778 --> 00:32:13,278
To some,
your cellphone's a miracle.

295
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,813
Yeah, but it's explained.

296
00:32:14,815 --> 00:32:16,781
The science behind that
is rational.

297
00:32:16,783 --> 00:32:19,651
Hmm. Enlighten me.

298
00:32:19,653 --> 00:32:23,524
A phone uses electromagnetic waves to
send your voice all around the world.

299
00:32:24,524 --> 00:32:28,359
Sending your voice
through invisible waves

300
00:32:28,361 --> 00:32:30,194
around the world.

301
00:32:30,196 --> 00:32:32,364
Sounds rational?

302
00:32:32,366 --> 00:32:35,933
So you're telling me
he uses invisible energy?

303
00:32:35,935 --> 00:32:40,505
I'm telling you that miracles
aren't contrary to science.

304
00:32:40,507 --> 00:32:43,909
What else could be
right in front of us,

305
00:32:43,911 --> 00:32:46,211
within us,

306
00:32:46,213 --> 00:32:49,713
that we just don't know yet
how to use.

307
00:32:49,715 --> 00:32:51,485
Hmm?

308
00:32:54,354 --> 00:32:56,758
Come.

309
00:33:24,417 --> 00:33:27,885
I'm gonna show you something
you might find hard to believe.

310
00:33:27,887 --> 00:33:30,590
Please, keep an open mind.

311
00:33:46,706 --> 00:33:48,006
What is this?

312
00:33:48,008 --> 00:33:50,611
The story of this mountain.

313
00:33:53,347 --> 00:33:55,946
Thousands of years ago,

314
00:33:55,948 --> 00:33:58,450
there was a temple here,

315
00:33:58,452 --> 00:34:02,787
and after meditating
for many years in this cave,

316
00:34:02,789 --> 00:34:04,489
this monk...

317
00:34:04,491 --> 00:34:06,624
became enlightened

318
00:34:06,626 --> 00:34:09,930
and shared his wisdom
with the surrounding villagers.

319
00:34:10,997 --> 00:34:13,298
One day...

320
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,866
soldiers from the north came...

321
00:34:15,868 --> 00:34:19,470
and seized the temple
and... destroyed everything.

322
00:34:21,675 --> 00:34:26,280
Then there was a period of
great suffering and oppression.

323
00:34:27,481 --> 00:34:29,316
Until...

324
00:34:30,383 --> 00:34:33,817
...this young prince
and princess bore a child.

325
00:34:35,555 --> 00:34:38,290
This child...

326
00:34:38,292 --> 00:34:40,828
possessed great power within.

327
00:34:41,961 --> 00:34:45,430
And after meditating
for many years in this cave,

328
00:34:45,432 --> 00:34:48,435
he, too, became enlightened.

329
00:34:49,502 --> 00:34:51,069
The monk...

330
00:34:51,071 --> 00:34:53,671
and the child...

331
00:34:53,673 --> 00:34:57,609
are believed to be forms
of an enlightened being,

332
00:34:57,611 --> 00:34:59,644
from another realm,

333
00:34:59,646 --> 00:35:02,980
born into the human world

334
00:35:02,982 --> 00:35:06,888
to end the suffering
of all sentient beings.

335
00:35:09,323 --> 00:35:11,689
This mountain...

336
00:35:11,691 --> 00:35:13,725
is that gateway...

337
00:35:13,727 --> 00:35:15,696
to that realm.

338
00:35:18,064 --> 00:35:21,899
This princess
is the caretaker...

339
00:35:21,901 --> 00:35:25,102
who helps him transition...

340
00:35:25,104 --> 00:35:28,506
in and out of this world.

341
00:35:28,508 --> 00:35:30,645
And with her help...

342
00:35:32,879 --> 00:35:37,852
...he has been reincarnating
for thousands of years.

343
00:35:39,819 --> 00:35:41,655
Our Guruji.

344
00:35:43,723 --> 00:35:46,424
We aren't the first ones
to realize

345
00:35:46,426 --> 00:35:49,928
that there is something
so beautiful happening here.

346
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:53,401
Things I never thought
could be possible.

347
00:35:54,801 --> 00:35:58,039
You just have to choose
to see them.

348
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,640
<i>This place is so beautiful,</i>

349
00:36:02,642 --> 00:36:04,109
<i>Jamie.</i>

350
00:36:04,111 --> 00:36:06,578
<i>There are things
happening here</i>

351
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:09,446
<i>I never thought
could be possible.</i>

352
00:36:09,448 --> 00:36:11,918
<i>I just had to choose
to see them.</i>

353
00:36:14,153 --> 00:36:16,756
<i>And for the first time...</i>

354
00:36:18,591 --> 00:36:21,959
<i>...I'm really getting to know
who I am.</i>

355
00:36:21,961 --> 00:36:26,434
<i>I hope you get to know who
you really are too, Jamie.</i>

356
00:36:31,437 --> 00:36:33,874
<i>I'm so sorry
we didn't work out.</i>

357
00:36:36,443 --> 00:36:38,446
<i>At least in this life.</i>

358
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:45,953
<i>Maybe we'll meet
in the next one.</i>

359
00:36:48,187 --> 00:36:50,957
<i>Take care of yourself, Jamie.</i>

360
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,847
Hey.

361
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:16,448
- Why'd you lie to me?
- What the hell are you talking about?

362
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:18,183
You knew Sophie.
She passed through here.

363
00:37:18,185 --> 00:37:20,517
Told you I don't know
who she was...

364
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:23,120
Don't lie to me.
You train all the new recruits.

365
00:37:23,122 --> 00:37:24,825
I know you knew her.

366
00:37:26,126 --> 00:37:28,662
Okay. Take your hands off me.

367
00:37:33,499 --> 00:37:35,135
I got you.

368
00:37:46,513 --> 00:37:48,716
I have to find her.

369
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,685
She left because of me.

370
00:37:55,021 --> 00:37:57,524
You've no idea
how much this means to me.

371
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,928
Is there a problem here?

372
00:38:02,896 --> 00:38:04,895
- No. We were just...
- It was my fault.

373
00:38:04,897 --> 00:38:07,564
I was at the water pump and,
um,

374
00:38:07,566 --> 00:38:10,067
Nitin spooked me by accident.

375
00:38:10,069 --> 00:38:11,836
It's fast reflexes.

376
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:14,542
- Nitin?
- It's fine.

377
00:38:25,051 --> 00:38:28,556
Meet me at the riverbank
at dawn; bring your boots.

378
00:38:50,276 --> 00:38:52,209
Nice to see you're on time.

379
00:38:52,211 --> 00:38:53,914
Hey.

380
00:38:55,781 --> 00:38:57,314
Where we going?

381
00:38:57,316 --> 00:39:00,954
You wanted to know
what happened to Sophie, right?

382
00:39:34,787 --> 00:39:36,921
Here.

383
00:39:36,923 --> 00:39:39,260
Found this spot a week ago.

384
00:39:44,731 --> 00:39:46,566
<i>Hey.</i>

385
00:39:57,276 --> 00:39:59,112
I'm sorry.

386
00:40:00,613 --> 00:40:03,147
Does anyone else know
about this?

387
00:40:03,149 --> 00:40:04,819
No.

388
00:40:06,185 --> 00:40:08,289
How long was she here?

389
00:40:09,622 --> 00:40:13,290
Three months. She disappeared
about two weeks ago.

390
00:40:13,292 --> 00:40:16,629
She and the Guruji
were very close.

391
00:40:18,832 --> 00:40:20,798
What's that supposed to mean?

392
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,933
I'm just telling you
what I heard.

393
00:40:22,935 --> 00:40:25,069
They spent a lot of time
together,

394
00:40:25,071 --> 00:40:27,607
made a lot of people jealous,
especially Chandra.

395
00:40:34,347 --> 00:40:36,180
What happened?

396
00:40:36,182 --> 00:40:37,915
I honestly don't know.

397
00:40:37,917 --> 00:40:42,252
The last couple of times
I saw her, she wasn't herself.

398
00:40:42,254 --> 00:40:47,058
Look, it's not really my place, but
instead of looking for Sophie,

399
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:50,030
maybe you should find out
what she was looking for.

400
00:40:51,196 --> 00:40:54,200
I better get back
before Chandra notices I'm gone.

401
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,970
Why are you helping me?

402
00:41:00,707 --> 00:41:02,643
It's the right thing to do.

403
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:06,981
She seemed very special.
I hope you find her.

404
00:41:38,745 --> 00:41:41,078
I have something for you.

405
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,247
What is it?

406
00:41:43,249 --> 00:41:45,783
<i>Two souls...</i>

407
00:41:45,785 --> 00:41:49,486
<i>You're bound to each other...
for all eternity.</i>

408
00:41:49,488 --> 00:41:52,890
So one's for you
and one's for me,

409
00:41:52,892 --> 00:41:57,263
and as long as we wear them...
we'll always be connected.

410
00:41:59,298 --> 00:42:01,198
<i>D'you make this?</i>

411
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,866
<i>Yeah.</i>

412
00:42:02,868 --> 00:42:05,403
Getting better.

413
00:42:05,405 --> 00:42:07,274
Shut up.

414
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:14,178
<i>Do you like it?</i>

415
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,116
It's beautiful.

416
00:42:18,283 --> 00:42:20,417
I love it.

417
00:42:20,419 --> 00:42:24,321
<i>I wanted to make something for us.
Kind of representing...</i>

418
00:42:24,323 --> 00:42:27,290
where we've been
and where we are

419
00:42:27,292 --> 00:42:29,028
and where we're going.

420
00:42:32,031 --> 00:42:34,133
<i>Where we going?</i>

421
00:42:35,968 --> 00:42:38,136
<i>I don't know.</i>

422
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:39,906
<i>Somewhere special.</i>

423
00:42:41,807 --> 00:42:43,309
<i>I hope.</i>

424
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:06,189
Jamie, where have you been?

425
00:44:06,191 --> 00:44:08,227
- For a walk.
- Have you seen Nitin?

426
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:10,528
What happened?

427
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:12,395
You can't just disappear
like that.

428
00:44:12,397 --> 00:44:14,131
Yeah, I know. I know.

429
00:44:14,133 --> 00:44:16,901
No, you don't know
what she's capable of.

430
00:44:16,903 --> 00:44:19,205
What do you mean?

431
00:44:20,339 --> 00:44:22,973
Just focus
on your own progress, okay?

432
00:44:22,975 --> 00:44:25,144
That's where
you'll find answers.

433
00:44:40,392 --> 00:44:42,028
Nitin?

434
00:44:58,443 --> 00:45:00,211
Nitin left.

435
00:45:00,213 --> 00:45:02,312
What do you mean?

436
00:45:02,314 --> 00:45:03,850
Left the Ashram?

437
00:45:16,963 --> 00:45:19,196
When you experience pain,

438
00:45:19,198 --> 00:45:22,301
you are functioning
at conscious level.

439
00:45:24,604 --> 00:45:27,307
But when you transcend pain...

440
00:45:29,975 --> 00:45:33,944
...you experience the true
nature of consciousness.

441
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:38,549
Confront the darkness
within you...

442
00:45:38,551 --> 00:45:42,153
and you will see the light.

443
00:45:44,089 --> 00:45:47,493
Consciousness
is not only within us.

444
00:45:48,627 --> 00:45:51,265
It's all around us.

445
00:45:53,499 --> 00:45:56,066
...your consciousness...

446
00:45:56,068 --> 00:45:58,171
...with that of the universe.

447
00:46:14,687 --> 00:46:17,191
<i>We're bound to each other.</i>

448
00:47:31,097 --> 00:47:33,533
You are making progress.

449
00:47:34,801 --> 00:47:38,272
But your journey
is far from over.

450
00:47:42,607 --> 00:47:44,611
We are running out of time.

451
00:47:45,644 --> 00:47:48,748
You still carry too much fear.

452
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:54,287
You must learn to let it go.

453
00:48:03,562 --> 00:48:05,162
Oh, Guruji.

454
00:48:05,164 --> 00:48:07,466
You must heal him.

455
00:48:08,767 --> 00:48:10,633
Are you sure?

456
00:48:10,635 --> 00:48:13,303
Be of pure intent.

457
00:48:45,671 --> 00:48:47,540
Oh, no!

458
00:48:58,917 --> 00:49:02,453
No, please. Let me try again.

459
00:49:02,455 --> 00:49:04,191
Give.

460
00:49:26,412 --> 00:49:28,578
We are finished here.

461
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:30,383
Please, Guruji...

462
00:49:31,850 --> 00:49:34,218
There is still time.

463
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:38,221
Time is not the issue.
It's your intention.

464
00:49:38,223 --> 00:49:42,562
You will never be
the caretaker.

465
00:49:58,743 --> 00:50:00,881
You can send the boy in.

466
00:50:34,446 --> 00:50:36,282
You found my spot.

467
00:50:41,521 --> 00:50:43,323
It's beautiful.

468
00:50:44,457 --> 00:50:47,461
It helps me remember
why I'm here.

469
00:50:50,463 --> 00:50:52,562
What do you want?

470
00:50:52,564 --> 00:50:54,934
I just wanted
to say thank you.

471
00:50:56,635 --> 00:50:58,669
I'm starting to understand...

472
00:50:58,671 --> 00:51:00,640
what it is you do here.

473
00:51:04,943 --> 00:51:07,310
Guruji knew this too.

474
00:51:07,312 --> 00:51:09,915
He's asked to see you.

475
00:51:11,484 --> 00:51:13,319
You can go up now.

476
00:51:15,955 --> 00:51:18,658
Jamie, you tell me
what happens up there.

477
00:51:37,977 --> 00:51:39,679
Hello?

478
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:47,521
May I offer you some tea?

479
00:51:49,854 --> 00:51:51,522
No, thanks.

480
00:51:51,524 --> 00:51:54,761
I need to tell you something
very important.

481
00:51:55,861 --> 00:51:57,761
Are you listening to me?

482
00:51:57,763 --> 00:51:59,833
Yeah.

483
00:52:02,602 --> 00:52:05,739
A cup of tea
is always a good idea.

484
00:52:10,542 --> 00:52:12,878
Come. Sit down.

485
00:52:14,546 --> 00:52:17,381
Do you know why you are here?

486
00:52:17,383 --> 00:52:19,616
To drink tea?

487
00:52:19,618 --> 00:52:22,622
You are here
because you know something.

488
00:52:23,622 --> 00:52:26,390
Not on conscious level,

489
00:52:26,392 --> 00:52:29,896
but deep down,
you always knew it.

490
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:33,564
And now,

491
00:52:33,566 --> 00:52:37,571
finally you have come here
to find the truth.

492
00:52:38,571 --> 00:52:40,404
What do I know?

493
00:52:40,406 --> 00:52:43,406
That there is
a universal consciousness

494
00:52:43,408 --> 00:52:45,743
that connects us all.

495
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:47,580
Is there?

496
00:52:48,914 --> 00:52:51,582
Of course there is.

497
00:52:51,584 --> 00:52:53,419
Your soul.

498
00:52:58,057 --> 00:53:00,823
- What are you doing?
- You have a secret here,

499
00:53:00,825 --> 00:53:03,796
which is causing you
great suffering.

500
00:53:10,935 --> 00:53:15,071
Guruji, I didn't come here
to find the truth.

501
00:53:15,073 --> 00:53:17,073
I came here to find a friend.

502
00:53:17,075 --> 00:53:18,776
I know.

503
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:23,113
But I'm talking
about what is in your brain.

504
00:53:23,115 --> 00:53:27,551
You must not carry this weight
alone.

505
00:53:27,553 --> 00:53:29,953
- It will destroy...
- Look...

506
00:53:29,955 --> 00:53:33,957
I don't know what you think
you know... but I'm fine.

507
00:53:33,959 --> 00:53:35,792
There's no secret.

508
00:53:35,794 --> 00:53:38,095
You can lie to others,

509
00:53:38,097 --> 00:53:40,734
but you can never lie
to yourself.

510
00:53:45,071 --> 00:53:47,071
You know what?

511
00:53:47,073 --> 00:53:50,841
Fine. Everybody else needs
your approval round here.

512
00:53:50,843 --> 00:53:52,979
I sure as hell don't.

513
00:53:55,013 --> 00:53:57,814
You have a gift.

514
00:53:57,816 --> 00:54:00,116
You can experience...

515
00:54:00,118 --> 00:54:03,486
the universal consciousness...

516
00:54:03,488 --> 00:54:05,824
that surrounds us.

517
00:54:08,827 --> 00:54:11,828
You can feel the beat

518
00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:14,166
of all living things.

519
00:54:24,176 --> 00:54:27,147
There are many things
within you.

520
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:30,913
Only you can choose
to see them.

521
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:41,026
What was that?

522
00:54:42,995 --> 00:54:44,864
We are done for today.

523
00:55:40,084 --> 00:55:43,020
Jamie?
What are you doing here?

524
00:55:43,022 --> 00:55:44,988
- What's in the bag?
- Nothing.

525
00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:47,827
- Gayatri?
- Nothing.

526
00:55:53,765 --> 00:55:55,234
Stop!

527
00:55:59,238 --> 00:56:00,940
Gimme the bag!

528
00:56:03,107 --> 00:56:05,111
No!

529
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:13,250
- What is this?
- Just herbs.

530
00:56:13,252 --> 00:56:15,352
- Are you drugging us?
- What?!

531
00:56:15,354 --> 00:56:17,354
- No!
- Is that what this is?

532
00:56:17,356 --> 00:56:21,091
Is that why I'm seeing all this shit?
Are you drugging us?!

533
00:56:21,093 --> 00:56:22,959
No! It's just medicine!
It's medicine.

534
00:56:22,961 --> 00:56:25,328
- For what?!
- I'm just taking it to Guruji.

535
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:27,767
What's wrong with him?

536
00:56:31,736 --> 00:56:33,238
He's dying.

537
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,841
What do you mean, he's dying?

538
00:56:37,843 --> 00:56:41,144
He's dying. Guruji's dying,
and we can't tell anybody.

539
00:56:41,146 --> 00:56:44,281
People here have devoted their lives
to him, and if they find out,

540
00:56:44,283 --> 00:56:46,752
can you imagine
what will happen?

541
00:56:48,821 --> 00:56:50,953
Gayatri...

542
00:56:50,955 --> 00:56:52,992
You knew Sophie.

543
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:56,896
I know you did.

544
00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:00,363
What did she say?

545
00:57:00,365 --> 00:57:03,902
If you know something,
you have to tell me.

546
00:57:07,673 --> 00:57:09,175
Is she alive?

547
00:57:11,676 --> 00:57:14,343
- Is she alive?
- I have to go.

548
00:57:14,345 --> 00:57:16,779
- No. Please.
- Yes. I have to go.

549
00:57:16,781 --> 00:57:20,053
No one talks to me.
You have to tell me.

550
00:57:21,185 --> 00:57:23,986
She's not the only reason
you're here.

551
00:57:23,988 --> 00:57:26,323
Please don't follow me.

552
00:57:26,325 --> 00:57:28,027
Please.

553
00:57:29,193 --> 00:57:30,696
Gayatri...

554
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:37,401
<i>One, two, three.</i>

555
00:57:37,403 --> 00:57:40,037
- Two. Pull it.
- Pull!

556
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:42,673
Slowly. Easy, easy...

557
00:57:45,276 --> 00:57:47,144
What?!

558
00:57:47,146 --> 00:57:48,879
You do this every time.

559
00:57:48,881 --> 00:57:50,680
Got it?

560
00:57:50,682 --> 00:57:53,015
- Yeah.
- Pull! Pull!

561
00:57:53,017 --> 00:57:56,188
- One more, one more...
- That's it. Pull!

562
00:57:57,722 --> 00:58:00,057
Wait, it's stuck.
Hold on, guys!

563
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:02,725
It's stuck. Hold on.
I can get it out.

564
00:58:02,727 --> 00:58:04,694
Okay? Hold on.

565
00:58:04,696 --> 00:58:07,430
Hold on, guys.
Almost got it, almost got it.

566
00:58:09,968 --> 00:58:12,069
Yeah! Hold on!

567
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:15,375
Come on! Only got two seconds,
guys, two seconds.

568
00:58:19,044 --> 00:58:21,912
- Watch out!!
- Argh!

569
00:58:21,914 --> 00:58:24,383
- - No!
- Ah!!!

570
00:59:02,955 --> 00:59:05,988
- <i>It's just a number!</i>
- <i>So the fact that the day we met,</i>

571
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:10,861
my birthday and your promotion all
happened on the 23rd means nothing.

572
00:59:10,863 --> 00:59:13,229
It's just a coincidence.
There's no higher meaning.

573
00:59:13,231 --> 00:59:16,966
It means something to me!
Why won't you just let me have...

574
00:59:16,968 --> 00:59:19,104
Because it's bullshit!
It's a fucking lie!

575
00:59:38,156 --> 00:59:40,059
I can't do this anymore.

576
00:59:41,093 --> 00:59:43,192
I'm not asking you
to do anything.

577
00:59:43,194 --> 00:59:45,263
I mean us.

578
00:59:46,464 --> 00:59:48,999
This isn't working.

579
00:59:49,001 --> 00:59:51,133
So what are you saying?

580
00:59:51,135 --> 00:59:53,470
We're different people.

581
00:59:53,472 --> 00:59:56,105
We want different things.
You want kids...

582
00:59:56,107 --> 00:59:58,575
Is that what this is about?
I told you, I'm okay waiting.

583
00:59:58,577 --> 01:00:01,944
No. It's not just that.
It's...

584
01:00:01,946 --> 01:00:03,849
Then what is it?

585
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:11,154
Whatever it is,
we can get through it.

586
01:00:11,156 --> 01:00:14,024
- No, we can't.
- Of course we can.

587
01:00:14,026 --> 01:00:17,093
Because we love each other and
that's what being in love means.

588
01:00:17,095 --> 01:00:18,962
It means being there
for each other.

589
01:00:18,964 --> 01:00:21,932
I don't love you anymore!

590
01:00:21,934 --> 01:00:24,169
Okay?

591
01:00:26,504 --> 01:00:30,809
So the sooner you get that
through your head, the better.

592
01:00:33,044 --> 01:00:36,214
- You don't mean that.
- Yeah, I do.

593
01:00:38,517 --> 01:00:40,520
It's over.

594
01:00:44,156 --> 01:00:46,059
<i>It's over.</i>

595
01:01:32,171 --> 01:01:34,173
Did you stop that beam?

596
01:01:35,173 --> 01:01:37,576
Did you know you could do that?

597
01:01:41,146 --> 01:01:43,950
Did the Guruji teach you
something, huh?

598
01:01:45,383 --> 01:01:48,120
Jamie, did he share a secret
with you?

599
01:01:55,459 --> 01:01:57,394
Jamie...

600
01:01:57,396 --> 01:02:01,064
he shared that secret
with Sophie as well.

601
01:02:01,066 --> 01:02:02,602
Yeah.

602
01:02:03,968 --> 01:02:05,905
She was here.

603
01:02:07,705 --> 01:02:09,608
And Jamie...

604
01:02:10,676 --> 01:02:12,609
...the realities...

605
01:02:12,611 --> 01:02:15,477
that you're beginning
to experience,

606
01:02:15,479 --> 01:02:17,482
Sophie experienced them too.

607
01:02:18,584 --> 01:02:21,183
It was too much for her,

608
01:02:21,185 --> 01:02:22,921
so she ran away.

609
01:02:23,988 --> 01:02:26,324
I figured she ran back to you.

610
01:02:27,626 --> 01:02:30,328
Then you come here
looking for her.

611
01:02:32,631 --> 01:02:35,167
I can tell you had hurt her.

612
01:02:38,636 --> 01:02:41,671
Why would you have
thrown her away?

613
01:02:41,673 --> 01:02:43,341
Why?

614
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:48,214
I'm dying.

615
01:02:52,517 --> 01:02:54,453
I have a brain tumour.

616
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:02,361
And I don't have long.

617
01:03:05,030 --> 01:03:07,033
And I never told her.

618
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:18,376
Maybe Sophie
came into your life...

619
01:03:20,044 --> 01:03:22,379
...just to lead you here.

620
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:24,216
Don't you see?

621
01:03:25,216 --> 01:03:27,052
You have a gift.

622
01:03:29,421 --> 01:03:32,388
We're meant to do great things
together.

623
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:35,560
Guruji doesn't have
much time left.

624
01:04:15,399 --> 01:04:17,734
No! No! No!

625
01:04:17,736 --> 01:04:20,339
No, no, no! No! No.

626
01:04:42,461 --> 01:04:45,127
I'm sure.

627
01:04:45,129 --> 01:04:46,631
I'm sure...

628
01:04:47,765 --> 01:04:49,769
Jamie?

629
01:04:52,636 --> 01:04:54,370
Jamie!

630
01:04:54,372 --> 01:04:55,772
Jamie...

631
01:04:55,774 --> 01:04:59,308
Jamie, you cannot go up there
like this!

632
01:04:59,310 --> 01:05:03,178
- Did you know?
- Know what? What's the matter?

633
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:05,615
- Nitin.
- Nitin what? What happened? What?

634
01:05:05,617 --> 01:05:07,616
Did you kill him?

635
01:05:07,618 --> 01:05:09,651
Don't lie to me.

636
01:05:09,653 --> 01:05:11,654
- Nitin...
- 'Cause he was helping me?

637
01:05:11,656 --> 01:05:13,659
No. I... I...

638
01:05:14,626 --> 01:05:18,294
Jamie, please. Please don't
bring this up to him!

639
01:05:18,296 --> 01:05:20,196
Get up.

640
01:05:20,198 --> 01:05:21,663
Wake up!

641
01:05:21,665 --> 01:05:23,332
You knew.

642
01:05:23,334 --> 01:05:25,769
You knew this whole time.

643
01:05:25,771 --> 01:05:28,604
Oh, Guruji, I'm so sorry.
I tried to stop him.

644
01:05:28,606 --> 01:05:30,372
And you want...

645
01:05:30,374 --> 01:05:32,674
Nitin. Nothing goes on here
without your knowledge!

646
01:05:32,676 --> 01:05:35,444
Are you accusing Guruji
of having something to do...

647
01:05:35,446 --> 01:05:38,448
- I'm not talking to you!
- Don't you yell in here, Jamie.

648
01:05:38,450 --> 01:05:40,850
- Don't you raise your voice.
- Chandra, please leave us.

649
01:05:40,852 --> 01:05:44,254
- Guruji is in no condition...
- Chandra!

650
01:05:44,256 --> 01:05:45,758
Do as I say.

651
01:05:57,535 --> 01:05:58,935
Come.

652
01:05:58,937 --> 01:06:01,207
- Sit down.
- No.

653
01:06:02,307 --> 01:06:03,939
Somebody's dead.

654
01:06:03,941 --> 01:06:06,709
He devoted his life to you
and you don't even care.

655
01:06:06,711 --> 01:06:08,214
Of course I care.

656
01:06:12,950 --> 01:06:15,852
She thinks she's protecting me,

657
01:06:15,854 --> 01:06:19,392
but her pain is blinding her.

658
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:24,861
I have a fear...

659
01:06:24,863 --> 01:06:27,466
what will happen after I go.

660
01:06:28,566 --> 01:06:29,868
Guruji.

661
01:06:31,870 --> 01:06:33,572
I need to know.

662
01:06:34,972 --> 01:06:39,477
If I keep digging out there, am I
gonna find Sophie's body, as well?

663
01:06:42,647 --> 01:06:43,883
Please.

664
01:06:44,883 --> 01:06:46,783
I need to know.

665
01:06:46,785 --> 01:06:48,754
I'm sorry.

666
01:06:50,455 --> 01:06:53,426
I was waiting
until you were ready.

667
01:07:00,598 --> 01:07:02,901
There is something you must see.

668
01:07:36,801 --> 01:07:38,634
What is this place?

669
01:07:38,636 --> 01:07:40,305
A doorway.

670
01:07:44,609 --> 01:07:46,743
Sophie.

671
01:07:46,745 --> 01:07:48,747
Sophie!

672
01:07:51,716 --> 01:07:54,283
Sophie. Sophie, hey. Hey, babe.

673
01:07:54,285 --> 01:07:56,653
Soph. Soph?

674
01:07:56,655 --> 01:07:58,854
Sophie.

675
01:07:58,856 --> 01:08:02,327
Hey, come here. It's me.
I found you. I found you.

676
01:08:04,796 --> 01:08:06,828
Sophie?

677
01:08:08,499 --> 01:08:10,235
Sop...

678
01:08:15,774 --> 01:08:19,008
Aren't those keeping you alive?

679
01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:21,480
It's for keeping her alive.

680
01:08:25,449 --> 01:08:28,518
Hey, baby. Hey, wake up.

681
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:30,256
Soph, wake up.

682
01:08:32,591 --> 01:08:35,791
- Why won't she wake up?
- She is in a state...

683
01:08:35,793 --> 01:08:38,694
of deep meditation.

684
01:08:38,696 --> 01:08:39,996
So deep...

685
01:08:39,998 --> 01:08:43,633
that her soul has left her body

686
01:08:43,635 --> 01:08:46,102
and cannot find
its way back in.

687
01:08:46,104 --> 01:08:49,339
- Is she in a coma?
- No.

688
01:08:49,341 --> 01:08:51,707
She is in a realm
between life and death.

689
01:08:51,709 --> 01:08:54,376
That's bullshit.
Wake up, Soph!

690
01:08:54,378 --> 01:08:57,013
Gently. Gently!

691
01:08:57,015 --> 01:08:59,349
We have to get her
to a hospital!

692
01:08:59,351 --> 01:09:02,488
If you remove her from here,
she will die!

693
01:09:11,029 --> 01:09:13,028
You did this.

694
01:09:13,030 --> 01:09:16,633
You did this and you left her
lying here for weeks.

695
01:09:16,635 --> 01:09:19,902
I was trying to help her...

696
01:09:19,904 --> 01:09:23,406
but she carried too much pain.

697
01:09:23,408 --> 01:09:27,943
I took her to the other realm
so she could transcend it.

698
01:09:27,945 --> 01:09:29,914
But she was trapped there.

699
01:09:30,914 --> 01:09:32,484
It's my fault.

700
01:09:38,056 --> 01:09:40,523
How can I believe
anything you say?

701
01:09:40,525 --> 01:09:43,596
Believing... is your choice.

702
01:09:50,601 --> 01:09:52,637
What do you mean, trapped?

703
01:10:53,498 --> 01:10:55,163
Sophie!

704
01:10:59,637 --> 01:11:02,074
Sophie!

705
01:11:07,846 --> 01:11:09,147
Jamie.

706
01:11:14,119 --> 01:11:15,854
Soph.

707
01:11:18,655 --> 01:11:20,156
Soph.

708
01:11:20,158 --> 01:11:23,526
You were right...
this whole time.

709
01:11:23,528 --> 01:11:25,161
You were right.

710
01:11:25,163 --> 01:11:27,866
Guruji, we gotta go back.

711
01:11:30,168 --> 01:11:32,171
Guruji.

712
01:11:33,538 --> 01:11:35,040
Guruji.

713
01:12:27,758 --> 01:12:32,027
No. No, no, no, no, no!

714
01:12:32,029 --> 01:12:33,598
No!

715
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:20,145
Come.
There's much to be done.

716
01:13:29,153 --> 01:13:30,987
<i>We will miss our Guruji.</i>

717
01:13:30,989 --> 01:13:34,624
But this is not his end,

718
01:13:34,626 --> 01:13:36,928
only his new beginning.

719
01:13:37,995 --> 01:13:40,795
And today we will celebrate...

720
01:13:40,797 --> 01:13:44,166
the sending of his spirit
to the next realm,

721
01:13:44,168 --> 01:13:48,073
so he may be born again
and return to us.

722
01:13:59,182 --> 01:14:01,787
Hey. Come on, okay?

723
01:14:19,037 --> 01:14:21,306
Where was she
when you saw her?

724
01:14:24,876 --> 01:14:28,310
- She was on a cliff.
- Jamie, when our soul crosses

725
01:14:28,312 --> 01:14:30,712
into the other realm,

726
01:14:30,714 --> 01:14:33,448
we must confront
our darkest moment.

727
01:14:33,450 --> 01:14:36,355
And overcome it
in order to come back.

728
01:14:37,721 --> 01:14:40,224
Does this cliff
mean something to you?

729
01:14:43,061 --> 01:14:45,027
Yeah.

730
01:14:45,029 --> 01:14:47,833
But if Guruji couldn't save her,
how can I?

731
01:14:51,069 --> 01:14:52,702
Sacred crossing.

732
01:15:09,253 --> 01:15:10,952
The sacred crossing

733
01:15:10,954 --> 01:15:14,959
provides a path for the
enlightened one to return.

734
01:15:17,729 --> 01:15:20,198
It's not the crossing of rivers.

735
01:15:21,966 --> 01:15:23,936
It's the crossing of souls.

736
01:15:25,203 --> 01:15:27,406
Sophie always said
we were soulmates.

737
01:15:29,473 --> 01:15:31,974
I didn't believe her.

738
01:15:31,976 --> 01:15:35,443
If you are connected
to each other beyond this life,

739
01:15:35,445 --> 01:15:38,246
then maybe you share
your darkest moment.

740
01:15:38,248 --> 01:15:41,052
Then we have to transcend it
together.

741
01:15:49,994 --> 01:15:52,294
Jamie... whatever happens...

742
01:15:52,296 --> 01:15:56,301
just be honest with yourself.

743
01:15:57,301 --> 01:15:59,471
You're getting a second chance.

744
01:16:13,083 --> 01:16:15,319
Chandra?

745
01:16:16,954 --> 01:16:18,487
- Where is he?
- Wait. No, no, no!

746
01:16:18,489 --> 01:16:20,959
He needs me right now!
He can't be in there!

747
01:16:52,056 --> 01:16:56,192
I am the caretaker, not you!
Not you!

748
01:16:56,194 --> 01:16:59,428
Sophie's not...

749
01:16:59,430 --> 01:17:01,999
Sophie's... inside?

750
01:17:18,583 --> 01:17:20,285
Hey.

751
01:17:27,458 --> 01:17:29,061
What are you doing here?

752
01:17:32,395 --> 01:17:34,065
Come home with me.

753
01:17:35,098 --> 01:17:37,867
Soph, you have to come
with me now.

754
01:17:37,869 --> 01:17:40,603
If you don't, I'm not sure
you're ever gonna be able

755
01:17:40,605 --> 01:17:43,275
- to come back.
- It's too late. It's over.

756
01:17:44,408 --> 01:17:48,042
- Doesn't have to be. Okay?
- Yes, it does.

757
01:17:48,044 --> 01:17:50,578
This is something I have to do
on my own.

758
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:53,581
I have to find it within me
to let you go.

759
01:17:53,583 --> 01:17:56,184
- What if we're not supposed to let each other go?
- Don't.

760
01:17:56,186 --> 01:17:58,586
- What if we're supposed to do this together?
- We're not together!

761
01:17:58,588 --> 01:18:01,557
- Yeah, we are.
- No, we're not! You left.

762
01:18:01,559 --> 01:18:03,427
You completely disappeared.

763
01:18:04,494 --> 01:18:07,395
We had something special,
but you threw it away.

764
01:18:07,397 --> 01:18:10,569
And you have no idea
how much that hurt me.

765
01:18:13,937 --> 01:18:15,970
I'm sorry I hurt you.

766
01:18:15,972 --> 01:18:18,443
You know what? I'm sorry too.

767
01:18:38,962 --> 01:18:42,197
I thought we were gonna be
together forever,

768
01:18:42,199 --> 01:18:44,602
but... I was wrong.

769
01:18:46,137 --> 01:18:47,606
No, Soph.

770
01:18:48,605 --> 01:18:51,273
You were right.

771
01:18:51,275 --> 01:18:53,612
You and I are always together.

772
01:18:54,712 --> 01:18:57,478
And we always will be.

773
01:18:57,480 --> 01:18:59,150
Jamie...

774
01:19:00,618 --> 01:19:03,488
How could I ever trust you
again?

775
01:19:14,030 --> 01:19:15,464
What are you doing?

776
01:19:15,466 --> 01:19:19,268
You and I were meant
to bring Guruji back,

777
01:19:19,270 --> 01:19:22,537
but you betrayed me
just like everyone else.

778
01:19:22,539 --> 01:19:26,075
You have to help me...
bring Sophie back.

779
01:19:26,077 --> 01:19:28,277
We don't need her.

780
01:19:28,279 --> 01:19:30,045
We never did.

781
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:33,285
It's a shame
she'll never know the truth.

782
01:19:34,284 --> 01:19:37,288
You're living on borrowed time.

783
01:19:52,470 --> 01:19:54,138
What happened?

784
01:19:56,473 --> 01:19:59,010
I need to tell you something.

785
01:20:02,245 --> 01:20:04,449
I'm dying.

786
01:20:06,150 --> 01:20:09,421
I was diagnosed
with a brain tumour.

787
01:20:11,288 --> 01:20:13,390
And they can't save me.

788
01:20:14,725 --> 01:20:16,561
That's why I left.

789
01:20:19,297 --> 01:20:21,596
Why didn't you tell me?

790
01:20:21,598 --> 01:20:24,168
I didn't want
to put you through it.

791
01:20:25,669 --> 01:20:29,406
But the truth is...
I was scared you'd leave me.

792
01:20:30,408 --> 01:20:32,707
You didn't even give me
a chance.

793
01:20:32,709 --> 01:20:34,678
I know.

794
01:20:37,515 --> 01:20:40,418
And not a day goes by
I don't regret it.

795
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:45,321
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

796
01:20:45,323 --> 01:20:48,389
I don't expect you to come back.

797
01:20:48,391 --> 01:20:51,492
You just deserve
to know the truth.

798
01:20:51,494 --> 01:20:53,198
I'm so sorry.

799
01:20:54,731 --> 01:20:57,269
I hope you can forgive me.

800
01:21:23,194 --> 01:21:26,131
I'll take care of Sophie, too.

801
01:21:37,307 --> 01:21:38,776
Ah!! Ah!

802
01:21:51,321 --> 01:21:52,790
Jamie!

803
01:21:54,324 --> 01:21:55,793
Jamie?

804
01:21:58,695 --> 01:22:00,895
Come back to me.

805
01:22:00,897 --> 01:22:03,232
Jamie...

806
01:22:03,234 --> 01:22:05,666
please come back.
Please come back, Jamie.

807
01:22:05,668 --> 01:22:08,370
I forgive you.
I forgive you, Jamie.

808
01:22:08,372 --> 01:22:10,842
Please...

809
01:22:23,354 --> 01:22:25,520
Oh, Jamie.

810
01:22:25,522 --> 01:22:27,191
Jamie!

811
01:22:33,631 --> 01:22:36,264
Don't let me go.

812
01:22:36,266 --> 01:22:37,866
Don't let me go.

813
01:22:37,868 --> 01:22:39,835
Don't let me go.
Don't let me go.

814
01:22:39,837 --> 01:22:41,539
I won't.

815
01:22:44,641 --> 01:22:46,310
I won't.

816
01:23:25,248 --> 01:23:26,684
<i>Yeah.</i>

817
01:23:28,586 --> 01:23:29,887
And?

818
01:23:36,427 --> 01:23:38,363
What does that mean?

819
01:23:42,833 --> 01:23:45,267
You got the bottle?

820
01:23:45,269 --> 01:23:46,771
Yeah.

821
01:23:51,441 --> 01:23:53,912
It was Dr. Michaels.

822
01:23:55,012 --> 01:23:56,781
Good news?

823
01:23:59,283 --> 01:24:00,819
Hey.

824
01:24:02,285 --> 01:24:04,452
Hey.

825
01:24:04,454 --> 01:24:07,788
Whatever happens,
we get through it together.

826
01:24:07,790 --> 01:24:09,461
All of us.

827
01:24:10,628 --> 01:24:12,464
Tumour's gone.

828
01:24:13,797 --> 01:24:16,801
- What?
- I'm in the clear.

829
01:24:18,002 --> 01:24:19,934
- Completely?
- Mm-hmm.

830
01:24:19,936 --> 01:24:23,307
Jamie... that's amazing!

831
01:24:25,943 --> 01:24:28,809
You hear that?
Daddy's gonna be okay.

832
01:24:28,811 --> 01:24:30,711
Shhh...

833
01:24:30,713 --> 01:24:32,950
Ah, shhh...

834
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:39,591
It's a miracle.

835
01:24:40,824 --> 01:24:42,590
What?

836
01:24:42,592 --> 01:24:44,863
It's a miracle.

837
01:25:29,877 --> 01:25:34,877
