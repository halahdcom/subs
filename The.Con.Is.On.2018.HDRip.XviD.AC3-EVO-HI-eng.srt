Where's Irina?

9
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,510
She sent me instead.

10
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,779
Let's look at the package.

11
00:02:23,767 --> 00:02:27,605
Give this to Irina,

00:03:26,762 --> 00:03:27,931
- I was at church.
- Oh.

- Hello, darling.

How'd it go?

00:03:33,236 --> 00:03:34,772
- [woman] Hmm.
- [man] Ooh.

18
00:03:35,005 --> 00:03:36,040
I see it went well.

19
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:38,907
- Irina will be pleased.
- Very.

20
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:41,745
- Fancy a bump?
- Just a tiny one.

21
00:03:42,713 --> 00:03:46,617

Irina won't miss a grand or two.

Why do we have to go
to Los Angeles?

46
00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:42,549
It's the safest place
we could possibly be.

47
00:07:42,551 --> 00:07:45,887
I mean, she'll be looking for us
in every hotel bar in London.

48
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:46,924
Oh, she'll do.

49
00:07:47,524 --> 00:07:51,095
She'll hunt us down.
She'll find us.

50
00:07:51,995 --> 00:07:53,364
She'll torture us.

51
00:07:53,997 --> 00:07:55,032
Me first.

52
00:07:55,932 --> 00:07:57,268
She's never liked me
for some reason.

53
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,204
Here. Take this.
You'll feel much better.

- [man] What was that?
- I don't know.

55
00:08:07,077 --> 00:08:09,077

No, no.

Bye, love.

Oh, yeah,
who was that then?

63
00:08:45,614 --> 00:08:47,417
Now, darling,
don't get upset.

64
00:08:48,017 --> 00:08:49,887
It was Sidney, wasn't it?
I might have known.

65
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,424
- He's an old friend.
- He's an evil old pederast.

I'm being asked to prostitute myself
for the sake of a criminal venture.

71
00:09:37,599 --> 00:09:41,070
All I'm asking is that you take
one for the team, all right?

72
00:09:41,704 --> 00:09:44,608
It's your own fault for being
so bloody beautiful, isn't it?

73
00:09:46,475 --> 00:09:50,010
- Here. Take this.
- I already took one.

74
00:09:50,012 --> 00:09:51,514
- Take another one.
- All right.

75
00:09:53,016 --> 00:09:55,685
And take one of these.

76
00:09:57,052 --> 00:09:58,087
All right.

- [Harry] Sidney.

82
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:27,984
My dear, dear Harry.
And, my own boy.

83
00:10:28,283 --> 00:10:32,488
[chuckles] Oh, my. Haven't
we been filling out, hmm?

84
00:10:33,022 --> 00:10:36,356
When I think back to how scrawny
you were when we first met.

85
00:10:36,358 --> 00:10:40,196
Like a little bird, a fledgling.
And now, look at you.

86
00:10:40,597 --> 00:10:41,999
Proud cock.

87
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:45,132
I do hope you've forgiven
your Uncle Sidney

88
00:10:45,134 --> 00:10:47,370
for that little mishap
in Turkey?

89
00:10:48,037 --> 00:10:50,440
I couldn't bear to think of you
being angry with me.

90
00:10:50,672 --> 00:10:54,377
Of course he's forgiven you.
It was only for a few months.

91
00:10:54,676 --> 00:11:00,149
I can't even imagine the horrors you
were subjected to in that sordid jail.

92
00:11:00,483 --> 00:11:05,155
I want you to tell me all about it.
Every little detail, hmm?

93
00:11:05,354 --> 00:11:07,422
All the ins and outs.

94
00:11:07,424 --> 00:11:10,127
[Harry]
Sidney? We need a word.

95
00:11:11,493 --> 00:11:13,329
Yes. This way, my pets.

96
00:11:19,401 --> 00:11:22,272
- [Harry] He's new.
- Yes, the last one split.

97
00:11:27,142 --> 00:11:31,714
[Sidney] You know, I don't think I've seen
you since Istanbul. It's been an age.

98
00:11:32,181 --> 00:11:34,247
What have you been doing
with yourself?

99
00:11:34,249 --> 00:11:37,217
Well, you know,
this and that.

100
00:11:37,219 --> 00:11:41,524
Import, export.
A little poker. How are you?

101
00:11:42,092 --> 00:11:44,158
Oh, much the same.

102
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,796
Still battling
this interminable ennui.

103
00:11:47,196 --> 00:11:50,564
You know, life is simply
insupportable without you, Harry.

104
00:11:50,566 --> 00:11:52,568
- Well, I'm back.
- So I see.

105
00:11:53,136 --> 00:11:55,539
- Staying with us long, I hope?
- Fuck, no.

106
00:11:56,439 --> 00:11:58,242
- That depends.

00:12:05,415 --> 00:12:06,450
Sidney...

110
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,620
- We need some work.
- [man] And money.

111
00:12:10,219 --> 00:12:13,056
- Shed loads of money.
- So I heard.

112
00:12:13,522 --> 00:12:15,691
How much do you owe Irina,
in fact?

113
00:12:16,158 --> 00:12:17,858
So you know about it, do you?

114
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,294
[chuckling] Yes.

115
00:12:20,296 --> 00:12:22,462
She is making
rather a fuss, you know.

116
00:12:22,464 --> 00:12:25,234
[Harry]
Is she? I can't imagine why.

117
00:12:25,468 --> 00:12:28,535
[scoffs] I borrowed a little
from her at poker.

118
00:12:28,537 --> 00:12:31,441
Nothing, really.
You know how it is.

- Get us some drinks, luv?

125
00:14:39,002 --> 00:14:41,001
- Drink?
- Yeah. Get us a round of drinks.

126
00:14:41,003 --> 00:14:42,535
- Yeah, you want?
- Yeah.

127
00:14:42,537 --> 00:14:43,839
Okay. I get.

Irina put a price
on your head.

133
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,843
You were aware of that,
I take it?

134
00:15:20,075 --> 00:15:21,444
I never knew she cared.

135
00:15:22,344 --> 00:15:25,449
Oh, I think we can both agree that
that just isn't true, is it, darling?

136
00:15:26,315 --> 00:15:28,816
And as for you.
You're a very naughty boy.

137
00:15:28,818 --> 00:15:32,022
I have a good mind to put you over my
knee and give you a very sound spanking.

138
00:15:32,789 --> 00:15:37,427
But as it is, I do have a small amount
of opium that needs delivering.

139
00:15:37,826 --> 00:15:39,526
Really? How small?

140
00:15:39,528 --> 00:15:40,930
Oh, uh...

141
00:15:42,431 --> 00:15:43,399
A comfortable amount.

142
00:15:44,533 --> 00:15:46,769
- [Harry] We'll do it for 50.
- [Sidney] Thirty-five.

143
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,037
Forty.

144
00:15:49,805 --> 00:15:53,844
[sighs] I'm so weak.
Because I love you, Harry.

145
00:15:55,945 --> 00:15:58,949
The, uh, usual method,
do you think?

146
00:15:59,648 --> 00:16:00,750
Of course.

147
00:16:03,485 --> 00:16:04,520
Gorgeous.

148
00:16:05,088 --> 00:16:06,456
I'm not doing it.

149
00:16:07,924 --> 00:16:10,060
Certainly not
for 40 fuckin' grand.

150
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:12,860
I mean it. I'm not doing it.

151
00:16:12,862 --> 00:16:14,595
[sighs]
We need the money, darling.

152
00:16:14,597 --> 00:16:16,364
I've had so many things
stuffed up my ass,

153
00:16:16,366 --> 00:16:18,531
I might as well get a boyfriend
and move to San Francisco.

154
00:16:18,533 --> 00:16:21,804
Don't be such a baby. It'll
be over before you know it.

155
00:16:22,537 --> 00:16:24,774
Quite frankly,
we have no fucking choice.

Don't fuckin' lie to me.

159
00:16:39,055 --> 00:16:40,089
I am not.

160
00:16:42,992 --> 00:16:45,362
That bitch still owes me.

Well, it's been such
a long time, hasn't it?

169
00:17:11,953 --> 00:17:16,692
I'd been meaning to call you up and
have a nice little chat with you.

170
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:20,194
But where does time go, hmm?
Where do you think?

171
00:17:20,196 --> 00:17:23,163
Sidney, I'm busy.

<i>Well, this won't take long.</i>

173
00:17:25,634 --> 00:17:27,700
I understand that you're
looking for a certain person,

174
00:17:27,702 --> 00:17:30,673
and that you're prepared
to pay a very handsome price.

- You nearly killed him!

- I am so sorry.
- Darling, are you all right?

00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:16,816
- He could've killed me.
- Where's the manager?

Uh, this way, please.
I...

towards making up
for this unfortunate accident.

191

It'll do.

192
00:18:29,131 --> 00:18:31,567
And call a doctor.

193
00:18:32,235 --> 00:18:34,968
- I need some painkillers.
- [man] Right away, sir.

194
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:38,639
Send us a personal shopper, will you?
We seem to have misplaced our clothes.

We're supposed to be going

[Harry] We've gone abroad, haven't we?
It's what you wanted.

202
00:18:58,861 --> 00:19:01,565
Los Angeles is not holiday.
It's a fuckin' lobotomy.

00:19:01,796 --> 00:19:06,100
And being hunted down by Joseph Stalin
is far from relaxing. Gin and tonic?

Lovely. What do you think?

205
00:19:08,938 --> 00:19:10,507
Fuckin' whore.

That's not the look
I was going for, but...

207
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:16,813
No. Not you. It's Jackie. Look.

208
00:19:17,813 --> 00:19:18,882
[Harry] Oh.

209
00:19:19,315 --> 00:19:21,151
Looks like she's
having trouble at home.

210
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,719
Perhaps we should
pay her a visit.

211
00:19:24,186 --> 00:19:26,156
No, no. Don't get
distracted, darling.

212
00:19:26,756 --> 00:19:27,958
You leave Jackie out of it.

- Four. You need to catch up.

Four martinis, please.

I hope seeing Sidney
isn't the extent of your plan.

219

How the hell are we gonna
pay Irina back?

220
00:20:05,628 --> 00:20:06,663
Any ideas, mate?

221
00:20:07,963 --> 00:20:10,132
I can always get in
on some games.

Are you insane?

223
00:20:12,334 --> 00:20:14,837
- What?
- My wife has a gambling problem.

224
00:20:15,237 --> 00:20:16,739
The problem is
she's no bloody good.

225
00:20:19,874 --> 00:20:21,874
And tell me one thing, my sweet.

226
00:20:21,876 --> 00:20:22,945
Hmm?

227
00:20:25,081 --> 00:20:26,616
Why does she hate you so much?

228
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,852
And it's not solely
because of the cash.

229
00:20:29,751 --> 00:20:30,886
There's some other reason.

230
00:20:32,755 --> 00:20:33,957
I want to know what it is.

231
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:36,293
- Oh, you do, do you?
- Yes, I do.

232
00:20:37,692 --> 00:20:40,026
Let's say she had
a little crush on me.

And when was this?

236
00:20:52,408 --> 00:20:55,145
Oh, years ago.
You didn't know me then.

237
00:20:55,644 --> 00:20:58,280
I was in Monte Carlo
doing some charity work.

238

Charity work? In Monte?

She's not after you

Fuck it! Why don't you watch where
you're fuckin' going, you...

316
00:26:06,488 --> 00:26:07,623
Hi, Jacks.

317
00:26:08,657 --> 00:26:10,560
[laughing]

318
00:26:12,294 --> 00:26:15,361
Peter! Peter!

319
00:26:15,363 --> 00:26:17,630
Oh, my God, I've missed you.

320
00:26:17,632 --> 00:26:19,265
Sorry about that.

321
00:26:19,267 --> 00:26:21,136
Oh, don't worry about that.
That's just a scratch.

322
00:26:21,569 --> 00:26:23,171
My God, what are the odds?

323
00:26:23,972 --> 00:26:27,607
- I know, right?
- I mean it must be fate or destiny or...

324
00:26:27,609 --> 00:26:29,078
Yeah,
something like that. Yeah.

325
00:26:29,978 --> 00:26:32,047
Oh, yeah, sorry. Come by.

326
00:26:33,215 --> 00:26:34,584
We had a wreck.

327
00:26:40,488 --> 00:26:42,288
So what are you doing in LA?

328
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:45,158
Oh, you know, hiding out
from gangsters and that.

329
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,525
[chuckles]

330
00:26:46,527 --> 00:26:48,664
- Are you alone?
- Oh, yes, quite alone. Yeah.

331
00:26:49,198 --> 00:26:50,700
Where's that crook you married?

332
00:26:51,767 --> 00:26:54,534
[Peter] You mean Harry?
Well, we're, you know...

333
00:26:54,536 --> 00:26:56,104
She's left you again?

334
00:26:57,372 --> 00:26:58,671
Well, thank God for that. Let's
hope it's for good this time.

335
00:26:58,673 --> 00:27:00,475
Now listen, Peter.

336
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:04,079
You should come by
the house tomorrow.

337
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,049
You and I
really need to talk.

338
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:11,219
Oh. Yes. It's new.

339
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:14,123
- Do you like it?
- It's, um...

340
00:27:15,391 --> 00:27:16,592
It's beautiful, Tiffany.

341
00:27:17,426 --> 00:27:19,429
- Gabriel bought it for me.
- Oh.

342
00:27:20,295 --> 00:27:22,998
Atonement for his sins.

343
00:27:24,432 --> 00:27:26,102
He must've been very bad.

344
00:27:27,036 --> 00:27:29,572
Yes. He was.

345
00:27:30,338 --> 00:27:34,009
He was very, very bad.

346
00:27:34,642 --> 00:27:35,678
Oh.

347
00:27:39,113 --> 00:27:41,515
- It's just a ring.
- Didn't need it.

348
00:27:41,517 --> 00:27:44,086
- Wouldn't miss it.
- Didn't even seem to like it.

349
00:27:45,453 --> 00:27:46,652
How much do you think
it's worth?

350
00:27:46,654 --> 00:27:48,557
A small fortune,
I should imagine.

351
00:27:49,324 --> 00:27:51,393
Certainly enough
to pay off Irina.

352
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:53,462
You deserve this, darling.

353
00:27:53,694 --> 00:27:55,364
- I do?
- Alimony.

354
00:27:55,697 --> 00:27:58,301
Compensation
for being married to her.

355
00:27:59,468 --> 00:28:00,633
- True.
- Yeah.

356
00:28:00,635 --> 00:28:01,671
- True.
- It is.

357
00:28:02,136 --> 00:28:03,038
Too bloody right.

358
00:28:04,172 --> 00:28:05,839
Hello, there. I'm Sandy.

359
00:28:05,841 --> 00:28:08,341
I'll be taking care of you guys
this evening. How are you doing?

360
00:28:08,343 --> 00:28:12,678
Well, a few seconds ago, I was fine,
but now I'm feeling rather depressed.

361
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,247
That's awesome.
So our philosophy is this:

362
00:28:15,249 --> 00:28:16,716
we're a farm-to-table
restaurant,

363
00:28:16,718 --> 00:28:19,186
it's all small plates,
and we like to share.

364
00:28:19,188 --> 00:28:20,623
Well, we don't.

365
00:28:21,155 --> 00:28:25,494
So, two very dry vodka martinis
with a twist, please.

366
00:28:29,264 --> 00:28:33,136
God, I love you. You're a
bloody genius, you are.

367
00:28:34,169 --> 00:28:36,171
Here's to you,
my little thief.

368
00:28:39,641 --> 00:28:42,745
Oi, Sandy. Sandy.

369
00:28:44,313 --> 00:28:45,680
Where's our fuckin' martinis?

370
00:28:48,316 --> 00:28:50,685
[lighter opens, clicks]

371
00:28:52,888 --> 00:28:58,061
Now, when you're in the house,
make an excuse to leave her.

372
00:28:58,794 --> 00:29:00,363
Do a little reconnaissance.

373
00:29:00,761 --> 00:29:02,294
Figure out where
the bedrooms are.

374
00:29:02,296 --> 00:29:04,066
Find the exits,
that sort of thing.

375
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:10,469
Right. So, get in there, get the
ring, get the fuck out of here.

376
00:29:10,471 --> 00:29:12,272
Pay Irina back and Bob's
your uncle, get it?

377
00:29:12,274 --> 00:29:14,177
- Got it.
- Good.

378
00:29:14,876 --> 00:29:16,645
Well, give us a kiss
for good luck.

379
00:29:21,216 --> 00:29:25,121
You don't need luck. I have
complete confidence in you.

380
00:29:26,854 --> 00:29:30,826
- Now, don't fuck it up.
- Right.

381
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,347
Looking for Jackie.

382
00:30:13,434 --> 00:30:14,536
Oi!
[echoing]

383
00:30:17,338 --> 00:30:18,640

00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,776

[whistles]

386
00:30:41,229 --> 00:30:42,265
Hey!

387
00:30:42,663 --> 00:30:44,764
This is my safe room!

388
00:30:44,766 --> 00:30:48,171
This is my safe room!

389
00:30:48,636 --> 00:30:49,804
Out!

390
00:30:50,505 --> 00:30:53,642
Out! Out, out!

391
00:30:56,978 --> 00:30:58,344
Fuck me, it's Gina.

392
00:30:58,346 --> 00:31:00,482
Surprise surprise.
Look who's back.

393
00:31:00,915 --> 00:31:04,719
Let me guess. Broke? No credit?
Bailiff's at the door?

394
00:31:04,952 --> 00:31:08,257
Abandoned by your criminal wife
in some foreign jail?

395
00:31:08,457 --> 00:31:09,859
Stop me when I'm getting warm.

396
00:31:10,792 --> 00:31:13,629
Unstable?
Medication's not working?

397
00:31:14,395 --> 00:31:16,932
Mine is. Now.

398
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:20,867
- Where's Jackie?
- You're looking for Jackie?

399
00:31:20,869 --> 00:31:24,507
You're looking for Jackie? You're
following crumbs, crumpet?

400
00:31:25,306 --> 00:31:26,675
Where's Jackie?

401
00:31:27,508 --> 00:31:28,810
Where's Jackie?

402
00:31:29,745 --> 00:31:30,680
Jackie?

403
00:31:31,013 --> 00:31:32,415
Jackie!

404
00:31:32,748 --> 00:31:34,316
Jackie!

405
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,451
Jackie!

406
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:39,654
She's downstairs.

407
00:31:40,689 --> 00:31:41,724
All right.

408
00:31:45,326 --> 00:31:46,595
[Hans] Peter Fox?

409
00:31:47,429 --> 00:31:48,430
Very nice.

410
00:31:48,697 --> 00:31:50,496
Very nice, indeed.

411
00:31:50,498 --> 00:31:53,469
- Who are you?
- I'm Jackie's assistant. I'm Hans.

412
00:31:54,001 --> 00:31:56,736
- I will fuck you.
- I seriously fuckin' doubt it, mate.

413
00:31:56,738 --> 00:31:59,938
- <i>Ja, ja,</i> it could happen.
- <i>Nein</i>, <i>nein.</i> You won't, mate.

414
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:02,612
- [Hans] <i>Ja, ja.</i> It will, I said.
- [Peter] <i>Nein.</i>

415
00:32:04,979 --> 00:32:07,346
Well, we can't have the
fireworks on the front lawn,

416
00:32:07,348 --> 00:32:09,582
because we can't have everyone
trudge across the grass to see them.

417
00:32:09,584 --> 00:32:11,351
What about their shoes?

418
00:32:11,353 --> 00:32:13,352
- Yeah, but we talked about...
- Well, don't contradict me.

419
00:32:13,354 --> 00:32:15,388
I don't think you quite
understand what's going on here.

420
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:17,791
And I do slightly feel I'm gonna
have to do it all myself.

421
00:32:17,793 --> 00:32:18,828
Oi, oi.

422

[hammering, distant]

423
00:32:23,565 --> 00:32:24,700
Peter Fox.

424
00:32:25,534 --> 00:32:26,535
There you are.

425
00:32:26,901 --> 00:32:27,937
You came.

426
00:32:29,203 --> 00:32:31,103
I brought you here today because
I wanted to tell you something.

427
00:32:31,105 --> 00:32:33,608
Can we be quiet,
please, everybody?

428
00:32:34,042 --> 00:32:35,878
- Shh. Thank you.
- [hammering stops]

429
00:32:38,113 --> 00:32:41,717
I've decided to forgive you
for everything.

430
00:32:41,982 --> 00:32:44,319
Oh. Right.

431
00:32:45,086 --> 00:32:46,953
Jolly good.

432
00:32:46,955 --> 00:32:49,892
Gurmukh wants me to forgive
everybody who's wronged me.

433
00:32:50,691 --> 00:32:51,826
So you're forgiven.

434
00:32:52,728 --> 00:32:53,763
This way.

435
00:32:55,564 --> 00:32:56,998
The fuck's a "Gurmukh"?

436
00:32:57,598 --> 00:32:59,131
See, I want
to hear everything.

437
00:32:59,133 --> 00:33:01,703
How have you been?
And what are you doing in LA?

438
00:33:02,003 --> 00:33:04,603
And how long are you here for?
And why haven't you called?

439
00:33:04,605 --> 00:33:06,438
- Om.
- Oh yes. Om.

440
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,344
Thank you, Gurmukh. Gurmukh
could help you too, possibly.

441
00:33:09,777 --> 00:33:13,846
See, I'm throwing a costume ball for
Gabriel's movie, which you must come to.

442
00:33:13,848 --> 00:33:17,550
<i>Ja,</i> Gabriel has been nominated for an
actual award for <i>Le Noir et le Rouge.</i>

Who gives a fuck?

00:33:20,689 --> 00:33:22,421
- I need a drink.
- They're right over there.

445
00:33:22,423 --> 00:33:24,359
Nothing for me, thanks.
I'm on a juice cleanse.

- Bollocks.

I'm not a communist.

Oh, this is that ring
that I was telling you about.

452
00:34:10,038 --> 00:34:12,908
This cost many millions of dollars.
I got it at an auction.

453
00:34:13,475 --> 00:34:17,011
- How many millions, exactly?
- 5.675.

454
00:34:17,546 --> 00:34:18,911
Oh.

gonna cost me this time?

00:35:37,993 --> 00:35:40,629
[Peter] The problem with attending a
party is that we have to attend a party.

474
00:35:40,828 --> 00:35:42,765
- [chips clattering]
- Her friends are gonna be horrible.

475
00:35:43,797 --> 00:35:46,035
You still haven't told me how
you expect to get away with it.

476
00:35:47,801 --> 00:35:48,937
You could switch it.

477
00:35:50,205 --> 00:35:51,006
Switch it?

478
00:35:52,573 --> 00:35:54,676
Switch the real ring
with the fake one.

479
00:35:55,009 --> 00:35:56,879
[Harry] You just need
to spike her drink.

480
00:35:57,779 --> 00:36:00,149
Is that the best you got, is it?
Knock her out and nick it?

481
00:36:00,649 --> 00:36:02,917
- You think it could work?
- It has to.

482
00:36:03,884 --> 00:36:08,556
Without that ring,
we're fucked 400,000 times.

483
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:11,026
And I promise you,
we will bleed.

484
00:36:11,792 --> 00:36:14,294
- [chips clattering]
- [speaking in Mandarin]

485
00:36:14,296 --> 00:36:17,533
[speaking in Mandarin]

486
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:45,127
[traditional Chinese music
playing]

487
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:50,763
[Peter] Can't get a decent
cup of tea in this country.

488
00:36:50,765 --> 00:36:52,998
Never mind tea.
I need a drink.

489
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,234
- Where the fuck is that old bitch?
- [toilet flushing]

490
00:36:55,236 --> 00:36:57,839
- She said it was ready.
- She did, didn't she?

491
00:36:58,073 --> 00:36:59,074
[door opens]

492
00:37:00,908 --> 00:37:02,243
<i>Xièxie,</i> Wendy.

493
00:37:05,913 --> 00:37:07,982
Not enough. More!

494
00:37:08,248 --> 00:37:10,185
Oi. You're welcome.

495
00:37:10,652 --> 00:37:13,222
- That was a bit priggish, wasn't it?
- That's the last of our cash.

496
00:37:13,821 --> 00:37:16,823
- We gotta do it tonight at the party.
- Go on?

497
00:37:16,825 --> 00:37:19,692
What the fuck am I gonna wear?
We spike Jackie's drink.

498
00:37:19,694 --> 00:37:20,728
Yes.

499
00:37:21,895 --> 00:37:23,798
- We do the switch.
- Yes.

500
00:37:24,165 --> 00:37:27,266
- And an hour later, we're on a plane.
- Yes! No, wait.

501
00:37:27,268 --> 00:37:29,301
Jackie does not react
at all well to drugs.

502
00:37:29,303 --> 00:37:30,939
They do not agree
with her at all.

503
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,076
- [Harry] I can imagine.
- No, you can't imagine.

504
00:37:34,843 --> 00:37:36,946
She's banned for life
from British Airways.

505
00:37:37,379 --> 00:37:39,248
She's not even allowed
in Canada.

506
00:37:39,647 --> 00:37:41,880
She is not
to be underestimated.

507
00:37:41,882 --> 00:37:43,151
I can handle her.

508
00:37:46,187 --> 00:37:47,221
Perfect.

509
00:37:48,022 --> 00:37:50,225
[jazz music playing]

510
00:37:56,897 --> 00:37:57,932
Fuck.

511
00:38:29,364 --> 00:38:32,234
Congratulations on your nomination.
I hear you're the frontrunner...

512
00:38:49,017 --> 00:38:51,317
- I'm so glad you're here.
- Fuck me.

513
00:38:51,319 --> 00:38:53,185
- I can't.
- Why not? I want you.

514
00:38:53,187 --> 00:38:55,120
Because Jackie's
right inside.

515
00:38:55,122 --> 00:38:56,788
Fuck that fat canary.

516
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:58,727
Yeah, but there's
photographers everywhere.

517
00:38:59,027 --> 00:39:00,225
[shutter clicks]

518
00:39:00,227 --> 00:39:01,229
Hey.

519
00:39:03,031 --> 00:39:04,464
This is a private party, man.

520
00:39:04,466 --> 00:39:05,901
Yeah, but I was hired.

521
00:39:08,937 --> 00:39:09,971
Hans.

522
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:12,441
- Take care of this.
- [Hans] Yes, sir.

523
00:39:14,975 --> 00:39:16,010
- Gabriel...
- Shh!

524
00:39:19,047 --> 00:39:24,053
I took Singapore Airlines first-class
from London. Much better than Virgin.

525
00:39:24,852 --> 00:39:27,922
I took Air France first,
and they had a chef.

526
00:39:29,823 --> 00:39:31,524
Well, I got a massage
on Virgin.

527
00:39:31,526 --> 00:39:34,997
It still doesn't compare
to Singapore.

528
00:39:37,031 --> 00:39:40,069
Those terrorists.
They ruined everything.

529
00:39:47,075 --> 00:39:49,841
I've never seen
so many ugly people in my life.

530
00:39:49,843 --> 00:39:53,011
Have any of these people ever even
seen a fashion magazine before?

531
00:39:53,013 --> 00:39:55,349
Mentally, I'm giving
everyone a makeover.

532
00:39:58,252 --> 00:40:00,221
Look at that bitch, Jackie.

533
00:40:00,922 --> 00:40:02,855
She's a revolting slut.

534
00:40:02,857 --> 00:40:06,395
[woman] Never mind a stylist,
she needs a psychiatrist.

535
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:13,035
They're saying that my films
are completely self-referential.

536
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,403
Because you are a genius.

537
00:40:16,069 --> 00:40:18,439
You're the finest actress
of your generation.

538
00:40:19,207 --> 00:40:20,873
I know.

539
00:40:20,875 --> 00:40:23,042
I'm so excited you guys
are making a movie together.

540
00:40:23,044 --> 00:40:24,877
How did the shoot
go today?

541
00:40:24,879 --> 00:40:26,982
It was a very
difficult scene, but...

542
00:40:28,382 --> 00:40:30,919
- I was magnificent.
- You were magnificent.

543
00:40:32,352 --> 00:40:33,387
Leave.

544
00:40:34,221 --> 00:40:35,990
- Chopped.
- Bitch.

545
00:40:40,093 --> 00:40:42,194
[Peter]
These fuckin' people.

546
00:40:42,196 --> 00:40:44,932
Makes me want to go on a three-day smack
binge in a brothel in Bangladesh.

547
00:40:45,466 --> 00:40:49,100
Darling, you're just too old-fashioned.
That's your problem.

548
00:40:49,102 --> 00:40:51,036
[Peter]
A fuckin' dying breed, I am.

549
00:40:51,038 --> 00:40:53,138
Here.
Give this to Jackie.

550
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,406
- When?
- Now.

551
00:40:54,408 --> 00:40:56,144
All right. Here you are.

552
00:40:57,879 --> 00:40:59,381
[sniffs]

553
00:41:01,114 --> 00:41:02,448
Well, drink it.

554
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:04,486
No, I'm not drinking,
just sniffing.

555
00:41:06,386 --> 00:41:10,057
Look at them. You know there are
rumors about them all over town.

556
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:14,060
- Who?
- My husband and that bad actress.

557
00:41:14,062 --> 00:41:14,997
Look at her.

558
00:41:15,495 --> 00:41:18,399
[Jackie]
She's such a slag.

559
00:41:19,234 --> 00:41:20,335
[groans]

560
00:41:20,535 --> 00:41:22,237
Two can play that game.

561
00:41:27,475 --> 00:41:28,509
Going.

562
00:41:29,277 --> 00:41:31,042
[laughs]

563
00:41:31,044 --> 00:41:33,414
She's going to pass out
in just a second.

564
00:41:34,082 --> 00:41:35,480
Wouldn't count on it.

565
00:41:35,482 --> 00:41:39,053
I don't know,
but I am on fire tonight.

566
00:41:39,319 --> 00:41:41,152
You are on fire tonight.

567
00:41:41,154 --> 00:41:44,859
- I'm like a tornado.
- You're like a tornado.

568
00:41:46,093 --> 00:41:50,031
- I am like the Fourth of July.
- You're like the Fourth of July.

569
00:41:50,665 --> 00:41:54,236
- I'm so sexy tonight.
- You are so sexy tonight.

570
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:58,904
And I have such
beautiful hair tonight.

571
00:41:58,906 --> 00:42:01,343
You have such
beautiful hair tonight.

572
00:42:03,243 --> 00:42:05,446
- Come with me.
- I'll come with you.

573
00:42:07,547 --> 00:42:08,549
[moans]

574

[sighs]

576
00:42:17,625 --> 00:42:18,527
[shudders]

577
00:42:21,328 --> 00:42:24,029
- You're so sexy to me right now.
- Oh, for fuck's sake.

578
00:42:24,031 --> 00:42:26,332
Why are married men
so attractive to me?

579
00:42:26,334 --> 00:42:29,270
- We're fuckin' not.
- Make love to me.

580
00:42:29,469 --> 00:42:31,670
- Fuck off.
- Please?

581
00:42:31,672 --> 00:42:33,341
- [straining] Fuck...
- [gasps]

582
00:42:37,277 --> 00:42:38,513
Where is everybody?

583
00:42:41,049 --> 00:42:42,515
We've had this date
from the beginning.

584
00:42:42,517 --> 00:42:44,419
Just close your eyes
and pretend I'm Jackie.

585
00:42:47,221 --> 00:42:48,556
Fuck's sake.

586

[humming]

587
00:42:52,359 --> 00:42:55,229
Am I havings a good time?

588
00:42:55,596 --> 00:42:57,565
She's bound to pass out soon.

589
00:42:58,665 --> 00:43:00,102
I wouldn't count on it.

590

Oh, Peter.

- You do it.
- You got a knife?

Whoo! [giggles]

613

[Gabriel] No. Vivien. Vivien, no.
I can't.

00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:51,513
- Fuck me.
- No.

615
00:44:51,745 --> 00:44:54,715
You haven't fucked me in days.

[chuckling]

617
00:45:02,189 --> 00:45:04,692
I made a promise
I'd stay faithful to Jackie.

618
00:45:05,393 --> 00:45:08,761
Fuck Jackie.
Don't be a pussy.

619
00:45:08,763 --> 00:45:12,267
Fuck me here. Fuck me now.

- Hello, Sidney.
- [sighs] My dear Irina.

633
00:46:19,533 --> 00:46:22,136
I do have a doorbell,
you know.

634
00:46:22,602 --> 00:46:25,172
One might almost suspect
that you didn't trust me.

635
00:46:25,605 --> 00:46:27,473
Why didn't you tell me
which flight you were on?

636
00:46:27,475 --> 00:46:29,810
I could have sent Kim Kim here
to come and collect you.

637
00:46:30,477 --> 00:46:31,712
Did you have a good crossing?

638
00:46:32,446 --> 00:46:33,482
Where is Harry?

639
00:46:34,181 --> 00:46:35,517
All in good time.

640
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:39,253
That information
comes at a price.

641
00:46:44,325 --> 00:46:46,160
[item slides across table]

642
00:46:46,928 --> 00:46:48,263
[exhales]

643
00:46:50,431 --> 00:46:53,468
[chuckles]
Oh, yes. Very nice.

644
00:46:54,234 --> 00:46:55,569
You came prepared.

645
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:57,439
I will not ask again.

646
00:47:00,207 --> 00:47:04,345
Well, if you mean her exact
geographical whereabouts,

647
00:47:04,779 --> 00:47:06,879
I haven't been able
to ascertain precisely...

648
00:47:06,881 --> 00:47:09,584
[laughing]

649
00:47:10,384 --> 00:47:13,221
- You lost her?
- It's not my fault.

650
00:47:13,721 --> 00:47:15,587
I set Kim Kim here
with the task of following...

651
00:47:15,589 --> 00:47:18,526
- Vlad, kill him.
- No, no, no.

652
00:47:18,859 --> 00:47:19,895
Please.

653
00:47:20,995 --> 00:47:22,697
Irina, my dear.

654
00:47:23,397 --> 00:47:26,531
Oh, still so impatient.

655
00:47:26,533 --> 00:47:28,569
If you'll just let me finish.

656
00:47:29,669 --> 00:47:33,874
I have been luring her
with the promise of a job.

657
00:47:34,408 --> 00:47:35,477
Hmm?

658
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:36,844
So,

659
00:47:37,377 --> 00:47:39,780
if we can, uh,
just calm down.

660
00:47:40,448 --> 00:47:43,248
And perhaps get
a good night sleep.

661
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:45,650
And tomorrow
we can drive all around town

662
00:47:45,652 --> 00:47:48,323
and discover which hotel
she's staying at.

663
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:50,525
I promise you we'll find her.

664
00:47:51,993 --> 00:47:53,228
Okay.

665
00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:57,364
Good.

666
00:47:58,665 --> 00:47:59,868
If not...

667
00:48:00,634 --> 00:48:03,404
I will slit you open
like the pig you are.

668
00:48:04,404 --> 00:48:05,806
[chuckles]

669
00:48:06,707 --> 00:48:08,743
Oh, you are wonderful.

670
00:48:09,542 --> 00:48:10,875
[snorting]

671
00:48:10,877 --> 00:48:12,279
Oh, fuck.

672
00:48:14,547 --> 00:48:19,921
The charm of this little escapade
is rapidly wearing thin.

673
00:48:20,888 --> 00:48:22,290
Why don't we just leave?

674
00:48:23,591 --> 00:48:25,926
- And go where?
- I don't know.

675
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:29,296
This is a fuckin' fiasco.

676
00:48:30,997 --> 00:48:32,900
What's the matter
with you, huh?

677
00:48:34,801 --> 00:48:37,738
You need a joint.
We need a joint.

678
00:48:38,839 --> 00:48:40,842
You said we're not gonna do
this sort of thing anymore.

679
00:48:42,375 --> 00:48:43,511
What sort of thing?

680
00:48:45,446 --> 00:48:46,480
This sort of thing.

681
00:48:47,881 --> 00:48:48,983
[sighs]

682
00:48:50,584 --> 00:48:53,020
- We've no choice.
- Oh, don't we?

683
00:48:54,821 --> 00:48:57,858
Wasn't me that lost hundreds
of thousands of pounds.

684
00:48:59,759 --> 00:49:01,962
It's not my ex-girlfriend
stalking us.

685
00:49:02,596 --> 00:49:03,632
It's not my fault.

686
00:49:03,931 --> 00:49:06,001
No. Never is.

687
00:49:07,033 --> 00:49:10,704
You reap what you sow, darling,
and you've sown fuck-all.

688
00:49:11,339 --> 00:49:12,373
Oh, well.

689
00:49:12,839 --> 00:49:15,776
Good night, and fuck off to you.

690
00:49:19,113 --> 00:49:20,511

Fuckin' hell.

694
00:49:57,752 --> 00:50:01,022
- How'd you get in here?
- I snuck in with the chambermaid.

695
00:50:01,589 --> 00:50:03,091
We need to talk.
Can you get up?

696
00:50:04,491 --> 00:50:05,627
Fuck's sake.

697
00:50:12,533 --> 00:50:13,935
- Here.
- What is it?

698
00:50:14,935 --> 00:50:15,969
It's breakfast.

699
00:50:18,071 --> 00:50:22,875
Oh, God, Peter. That's disgusting.
That is fucking disgusting.

700
00:50:22,877 --> 00:50:23,911
Did you see them?

701
00:50:26,013 --> 00:50:27,145
Who?

702
00:50:27,147 --> 00:50:29,181
Gabriel and Vivien.

703
00:50:29,183 --> 00:50:33,121
I woke up this morning and I
found this in my bed. It's hers.

704
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,857
He's fucking her,
and he's fucking her in my bed.

705
00:50:37,892 --> 00:50:40,395
No, I don't think so, mate.
Nope.

706
00:50:40,895 --> 00:50:41,930
Okay.

707
00:50:42,663 --> 00:50:44,866
Peter, baby.

708
00:50:45,799 --> 00:50:49,103
Please come back to the house
because he's threatened by you.

709
00:50:49,602 --> 00:50:52,072
And, he knows that
you never got over me.

710
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:57,846
And I could tell, by the way that
you looked at me last night,

711
00:50:58,546 --> 00:51:00,147
that you still want me.

712
00:51:01,681 --> 00:51:02,716
So...

713
00:51:04,218 --> 00:51:05,886
you can have me.

714
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:11,725
No, thanks.

715
00:51:13,127 --> 00:51:14,225
[Jackie] Listen, fuck it, Peter. I
need you to come back to the house.

716
00:51:14,227 --> 00:51:16,964
I need you to come and stay, okay?
I really need you.

717
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,100
Actually...

rather be in the company of...

- Okay.
- ...right now.

721
00:51:30,143 --> 00:51:32,446
- [Jackie] Okay.
- [Peter] I need laughs, you know.

722
00:51:32,812 --> 00:51:35,616
- With people who understand me.
- Come on.

723
00:51:35,815 --> 00:51:37,618
And I need to fuckin' relax!

So, I think we should start
at the Four Seasons

726
00:51:49,763 --> 00:51:52,433
and work our way down.
It shouldn't take too long.

727

How are you? Have you healed up?

Good. So...

Really?

732

Oh, really?

733
00:52:09,817 --> 00:52:12,116
Oh, now that's very interesting.
That's very interesting, indeed.

00:52:12,118 --> 00:52:14,154
Thank you, Cedric. I owe you.

and you'll be with her.

Good afternoon, madam.

743
00:52:52,192 --> 00:52:54,127
May I have a word about some of the
charges you've been placing on the room?

744
00:52:54,861 --> 00:52:58,499
I'm afraid we're going to need
some form of payment very soon.

745
00:52:58,866 --> 00:53:01,134
I'll be right down
with my card.

I'm going to take you

what you're talking about.

[Jackie] You've forgotten
about this, have you?

You've forgotten about the five million
dollar ring and everything you said?

Well, what about if I just
throw it in the toilet?

Should I just throw the ring
in the toilet? Should I?

Should I just throw it away?
Fuck the ring!

I don't have time for this.

00:57:07,281 --> 00:57:09,547
I have important decisions
I have to make every single day

794
00:57:09,549 --> 00:57:11,116
because I'm making a film.

795
00:57:11,118 --> 00:57:14,154
I'm making a film.
I am making a film.

796
00:57:14,888 --> 00:57:16,324
Boring.

797
00:57:17,357 --> 00:57:18,493
I'm gonna go to the set.

798
00:57:19,091 --> 00:57:20,327
[Jackie]
Not with Conchita, you're not.

799
00:57:20,593 --> 00:57:22,426
- Give me the dog.
- No.

800
00:57:22,428 --> 00:57:25,432
Give me the dog. The dog whisperer
is coming today. Let go.

801
00:57:26,466 --> 00:57:27,502
Let the fuck go.

802
00:57:35,542 --> 00:57:37,245
[gulps] Ahh.

803
00:57:37,977 --> 00:57:39,446
Oh, for fuck's sake.

804
00:57:43,517 --> 00:57:44,819
I need a drink.

805
00:57:47,087 --> 00:57:48,156
[glass breaks]

806
00:57:50,223 --> 00:57:51,992
Where's the vodka?

807
00:57:54,194 --> 00:57:55,163
You can't be here.

808
00:57:56,596 --> 00:58:00,200
- Irina's here in LA.
- Eh?

809
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,035
[groans]

810
00:58:03,035 --> 00:58:04,371
[Jackie]
<i>Juanita?</i>

811
00:58:05,138 --> 00:58:06,937
Juanita?

812
00:58:06,939 --> 00:58:09,440
Oh, hi. Uh, did I miss
the dog whisperer? Is he here?

813
00:58:09,442 --> 00:58:10,812
- Who?
- [softly] Shit.

814
00:58:13,614 --> 00:58:16,080
Oh, voicemail.

815
00:58:16,082 --> 00:58:18,318
Gina, it's me, and the dog whisperer
didn't show up. Can you please call?

816
00:58:18,986 --> 00:58:21,353
Oh, there you are.
Oh, you're here.

817
00:58:21,355 --> 00:58:23,224
How funny.
I thought you'd be a man.

818
00:58:24,223 --> 00:58:26,259
No, I'm not a man.

819
00:58:26,926 --> 00:58:29,229
- How's your Spanish?
- All right, I suppose.

820
00:58:29,495 --> 00:58:32,065
Well, I hope it's good enough for
you to communicate with her.

821
00:58:32,598 --> 00:58:34,098
With her?

822
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:37,534
[Jackie] I don't know how good her English
is. You know, we had her flown in.

823
00:58:37,536 --> 00:58:38,305
[whispers]
She's Mexican.

824
00:58:39,138 --> 00:58:40,341
Oh, I see.

825
00:58:41,107 --> 00:58:43,341
Which I suppose
might be part of the problem,

826
00:58:43,343 --> 00:58:46,547
you know, that she doesn't understand me.
How do you do it?

827
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:48,950
Communicate, I mean,
with them.

828
00:58:49,348 --> 00:58:52,150
What it is exactly
you want me to say to her?

829
00:58:52,152 --> 00:58:55,053
Tell her I clean up after her morning,
noon, and night and I want some respect.

830
00:58:55,055 --> 00:58:57,656
I mean, she's lazy. She's disagreeable.
She's spoilt.

831
00:58:57,658 --> 00:59:00,060
I'm sick of her pissing and
shitting all over the place.

832
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:02,896
- [doorbell rings]
- That's the door, Peter.

833
00:59:06,667 --> 00:59:08,935
- What?
- Dog whisperer.

834
00:59:09,669 --> 00:59:10,904
I've already got one, mate.

835
00:59:22,616 --> 00:59:25,453
<i>Hola, señora.</i>

836
00:59:25,953 --> 00:59:27,221
<i>¿Y ahora esta qué trae?</i>

837
00:59:28,422 --> 00:59:30,721
- <i>Con permiso.</i>
- <i>Ay, Dios, ella habla español.</i>

838
00:59:30,723 --> 00:59:33,894
<i>Su empleadora
quiere que le diga...</i>

839
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,962
<i>¿Qué? ¿Qué?</i>

840
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:39,730
- [whispering, indistinct]
- <i>¡Ay!</i>

841
00:59:39,732 --> 00:59:41,468
[speaking in Spanish]

842
00:59:48,241 --> 00:59:49,277
[Jackie]
Here she is.

843
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:51,946
[gasps]

844
00:59:52,645 --> 00:59:55,679
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Peter.

845
00:59:55,681 --> 00:59:58,451
You won't believe
what Juanita just did.

846
00:59:59,685 --> 01:00:01,087
That was incredible.

847
01:00:02,288 --> 01:00:04,624
Thank God that the dog whisperer
was here as a witness.

848
01:00:07,194 --> 01:00:10,163
I prefer pet communicator.

849
01:00:10,464 --> 01:00:11,699
Oh, for fuck's sake.

850
01:00:16,102 --> 01:00:17,268
<i>Buenos días.</i>

851
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:18,706
[whimpering]

852
01:00:19,138 --> 01:00:20,705
[Harry sighs]

853
01:00:20,707 --> 01:00:22,076
<i>¿Y tu problema?</i>

854
01:00:23,576 --> 01:00:24,611
<i>Sí.</i>

855
01:00:25,645 --> 01:00:26,681
<i>Sí.</i>

856
01:00:27,413 --> 01:00:28,448
<i>Sí.</i>

857
01:00:29,382 --> 01:00:30,417
<i>Sí.</i>

858
01:00:32,118 --> 01:00:33,219
<i>Entiendo.</i>

859
01:00:34,388 --> 01:00:35,719
Well, what's she saying?

860
01:00:35,721 --> 01:00:38,656
I'm sorry.
She has a lot of resentments.

861
01:00:38,658 --> 01:00:40,792
It's hard to keep track.

862
01:00:40,794 --> 01:00:43,294
Well, tell her that I have a few
complaints of my own. Firstly...

863
01:00:43,296 --> 01:00:44,332
<i>Sí.</i>

864
01:00:45,031 --> 01:00:46,196
<i>Sí.</i>

865
01:00:46,198 --> 01:00:47,233
<i>Sí.</i>

866
01:00:48,167 --> 01:00:49,069
<i>Sí, sí.</i>

867
01:00:49,569 --> 01:00:51,339
She says she's disappointed.

868
01:00:51,805 --> 01:00:54,408
This is not
what she was led to expect.

869
01:00:54,607 --> 01:00:56,209
Well, that's quite
ungrateful of her.

870
01:00:57,511 --> 01:00:59,044
I mean, does she have any idea
how privileged she actually is,

871
01:00:59,046 --> 01:01:00,614
and to be adopted
by a celebrity?

872
01:01:01,047 --> 01:01:03,049
She said she's never
heard of you.

873
01:01:03,549 --> 01:01:06,019
That little bitch.

874
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:09,654
And I suppose she's never heard
of Gabriel, either.

875
01:01:09,656 --> 01:01:11,325
[snorting]

876
01:01:11,792 --> 01:01:13,661
[Harry] She doesn't think
he's very talented.

877
01:01:14,493 --> 01:01:16,527
Rather mediocre, in fact.

878
01:01:16,529 --> 01:01:19,065
- Ha!
- Peter, shut the fuck up.

879
01:01:19,332 --> 01:01:22,636
[Harry] She's saying you
got off on the wrong foot.

880
01:01:23,169 --> 01:01:25,005
She thinks you're depressed.

881
01:01:25,672 --> 01:01:29,440
She says she sees you
crying sometimes,

882
01:01:29,442 --> 01:01:32,580
and it makes her very, very sad.

883
01:01:34,547 --> 01:01:36,750
Oh, Jesus Christ.

884
01:01:39,585 --> 01:01:41,756
I mean, I had no idea
that she was so insightful.

885
01:01:42,321 --> 01:01:44,190
She's trying
to tell me something.

886
01:01:45,591 --> 01:01:48,426
Something about
some new piece of jewelry.

887
01:01:48,428 --> 01:01:50,295
[Jackie] No, no, no.
It must be my... my ring.

888
01:01:50,297 --> 01:01:52,632
It's my ring. It's my ring.
Does she like it?

889
01:01:53,567 --> 01:01:59,707
She's saying that... that
she's jealous of the ring.

890
01:02:00,607 --> 01:02:05,413
She's saying that you wear it too much,
and I think she'd like to borrow it.

891
01:02:05,645 --> 01:02:07,114
What do you take me for?

892
01:02:08,314 --> 01:02:11,484
Dogs don't wear rings.
I'm not an idiot.

893
01:02:12,384 --> 01:02:13,687
Do you know what I think?

894
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:17,855
I think that she's having you on.
She's a little minx.

895
01:02:17,857 --> 01:02:19,424
[whimpering]

896
01:02:19,426 --> 01:02:20,728
[Jackie]
Do you promise me you'll stay?

897
01:02:21,227 --> 01:02:22,462
It's how I work.

898
01:02:23,196 --> 01:02:24,431
I move in...

899
01:02:25,464 --> 01:02:27,434
get to know the dog.

900
01:02:28,701 --> 01:02:30,337
Work with the family.

901
01:02:30,770 --> 01:02:35,205
It's a holistic thing.
A whole lot of healing.

902
01:02:35,207 --> 01:02:37,677
[liquid pouring]

903
01:02:42,582 --> 01:02:44,214
Who the hell are you?

904
01:02:44,216 --> 01:02:46,152
What do you mean?
It's the dog whisperer.

905
01:02:46,352 --> 01:02:47,754
Pet communicator.

906
01:02:48,187 --> 01:02:49,754
When I called and made
the appointment,

907
01:02:49,756 --> 01:02:53,227
the person on the other end
of the line was a man.

908
01:02:53,792 --> 01:02:55,195
I had a hangover.

909
01:02:55,728 --> 01:02:56,763
Literally...

910
01:02:57,897 --> 01:02:59,232
a man.

911
01:02:59,933 --> 01:03:03,201
Conchita warned me about her. She
doesn't like the way she touches her.

912
01:03:03,203 --> 01:03:04,701
- She touches her?
- Yes.

913
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:06,606
I only touch her with feeling.

914
01:03:07,573 --> 01:03:09,841
Chita, walkies.

915
01:03:09,843 --> 01:03:12,346
I don't think so, you weirdo. There's
been quite enough of that already.

916
01:03:13,212 --> 01:03:14,582
Chita's my twin.

917
01:03:16,415 --> 01:03:17,684
We have a connection.

918
01:03:19,685 --> 01:03:21,254
No one understands.

919
01:03:23,323 --> 01:03:26,727
[tapping]

920
01:03:35,468 --> 01:03:37,337
[cell phone ringing]
[clatter]

921
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:43,243
Oh, I better get a new glass.

922
01:03:44,277 --> 01:03:45,446
- Hi.
- It's Vivien.

923
01:03:45,779 --> 01:03:47,344
I can't really talk right now.

924
01:03:47,346 --> 01:03:49,350
- It's not a very good time.
- Vivien.

925
01:03:49,848 --> 01:03:50,884
Oh.

926
01:03:51,585 --> 01:03:52,786
- [Gina] Vivien.
- Right.

927
01:03:58,625 --> 01:03:59,593
Don't get up.

928
01:04:00,859 --> 01:04:03,393
[Jackie] Now, Peter,
I'm so glad you're here,

929
01:04:03,395 --> 01:04:05,730
and I really do want you
to stay as long as you like.

930
01:04:05,732 --> 01:04:07,431
Because now that bitch wife
has left you,

931
01:04:07,433 --> 01:04:09,636
I really feel it's my duty
to take care of you.

932
01:04:11,437 --> 01:04:13,439
Well, thank you, Jackie.

933
01:04:14,975 --> 01:04:17,475
She's always let me down.

934
01:04:17,477 --> 01:04:19,647
I know, and you're better off without her.
I did beg you not to marry her.

935
01:04:20,346 --> 01:04:21,582
[Peter]
If only I'd listened.

936
01:04:22,716 --> 01:04:23,817
Horrendous woman.

937
01:04:24,584 --> 01:04:26,583
- I hate her.
- You've never met her.

938
01:04:26,585 --> 01:04:28,386
I don't have to meet her
to hate her.

939
01:04:28,388 --> 01:04:29,422
Oh, right. Yeah.

940
01:04:30,422 --> 01:04:31,725
Yeah, I hate her, too.

941
01:04:32,491 --> 01:04:33,694
I loathe her.

942
01:04:34,794 --> 01:04:35,592
[Jackie] Yes, because she
fleeced you for all you had.

943
01:04:35,594 --> 01:04:37,864
I mean,
she treated you shamefully.

944
01:04:38,497 --> 01:04:40,797
You see, they met in rehab.

945
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:43,770
I mean, what kind of person
does one meet in rehab?

946
01:04:44,370 --> 01:04:48,441
Huh. Maybe it wasn't her fault.
Maybe it was a court order.

947
01:04:48,841 --> 01:04:52,342
Yeah. I suppose I wouldn't be surprised. I
mean, we know nothing about her, do we?

948
01:04:52,344 --> 01:04:54,314
We don't know about her
family, or anything. She's...

949
01:04:55,015 --> 01:04:56,482
She's probably trash.

950
01:04:57,716 --> 01:04:59,850
And, you know, don't forget
that time she abandoned you.

951
01:04:59,852 --> 01:05:03,487
For all those months on end, and
left you to fend for yourself.

952
01:05:03,489 --> 01:05:06,857
I mean, God knows what she got up to.
She's such a slag.

953
01:05:06,859 --> 01:05:10,328
I mean, when I think of all the
things that she did to you...

954
01:05:10,330 --> 01:05:13,063
[exhales] Everybody
makes mistakes, don't they?

955
01:05:13,065 --> 01:05:14,899
No, don't defend her.

956
01:05:14,901 --> 01:05:16,900
He went to jail because of her.
I had to bail him out.

957
01:05:16,902 --> 01:05:18,671
[Gabriel]
<i>I had to bail him out!</i>

958
01:05:21,308 --> 01:05:25,346
Vivien, I can't talk right now.

959
01:05:26,078 --> 01:05:27,978
- [Vivien] <i>Are you with her?</i>
- No.

960
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:29,984
- <i>Are you fucking her?</i>
- No.

961
01:05:31,384 --> 01:05:33,020
You stupid bastard.

962
01:05:33,852 --> 01:05:37,020
You said you loved me.
Now love me.

963
01:05:37,022 --> 01:05:38,422
[Gabriel sighs]

964
01:05:38,424 --> 01:05:41,594
Vivien...
[chuckles] I... No.

965
01:05:43,395 --> 01:05:47,998
I want you. I want you to fuck me.
[nervous laughter]

966
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,035
<i>No.</i>

967
01:05:49,535 --> 01:05:52,837
- I can't talk right now.
- <i>You coward.</i>

968
01:05:52,839 --> 01:05:55,073
It's the fucking awards
tomorrow.

969
01:05:55,075 --> 01:05:58,375
Why don't I just go on stage

970
01:05:58,377 --> 01:06:02,582
and I tell the whole world
that you're fucking me?

971
01:06:03,450 --> 01:06:04,752
Tomorrow...

972
01:06:05,451 --> 01:06:07,819
[sighs]
after the awards,

973
01:06:07,821 --> 01:06:12,860
I'll talk to you,
and we'll clear everything up,

974
01:06:13,593 --> 01:06:16,661
about Jackie and what to do.

975
01:06:16,663 --> 01:06:20,765
I am going to cut your little balls,
and I'm gonna feed them to you.

976
01:06:20,767 --> 01:06:22,799
- <i>Pendejo.</i>
- I've gotta... I've gotta go. Bye.

977
01:06:22,801 --> 01:06:27,071
You're not gonna sound like a
victim anymore. Piece of shit!

978

[phone clatters]

979
01:06:30,377 --> 01:06:32,042
If I met her,
I'd spit in her face.

980
01:06:32,044 --> 01:06:33,643
- Oh, would you?
- Yeah, I would.

981
01:06:33,645 --> 01:06:36,783
- Really? Astonishing.
- [footsteps]

982
01:06:39,051 --> 01:06:40,086
Wow.

983
01:06:40,953 --> 01:06:42,022
Wow.

984
01:06:43,089 --> 01:06:44,692
You look very, uh...

985
01:06:46,692 --> 01:06:47,627
Hmm.

986
01:06:47,893 --> 01:06:49,562
I'm a filmmaker.

987
01:06:50,897 --> 01:06:52,763
Have you acted?

988
01:06:52,765 --> 01:06:56,336
For God's sake, Gabriel. She's
the dog whisperer. I told you.

989
01:06:56,770 --> 01:06:58,835
Pet communicator.

[urine trickling]

01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:05,012
Oh. Conchita's pissing on my chair.
What do you think she wants?

992
01:07:05,611 --> 01:07:06,579
Oh.

993
01:07:06,779 --> 01:07:08,982
She said you have
a bad attitude.

994
01:07:09,982 --> 01:07:11,384
You talk to the dog?

995
01:07:12,785 --> 01:07:14,454
[whimpers]

996
01:07:15,654 --> 01:07:17,557
- Hi.
- [Gina] Hi.

997
01:07:18,924 --> 01:07:22,662
- Did you see my movie?
- I love your movie.

998
01:07:24,864 --> 01:07:26,033
Mediocre?

999
01:07:28,435 --> 01:07:29,870
Are you my enemy?

1000
01:07:30,169 --> 01:07:34,138
No. No. I'm your lover.

1001
01:07:34,140 --> 01:07:35,408
I love you.

1002
01:07:40,113 --> 01:07:43,584
- Mediocre.
- [Gina] No. No.

1003
01:07:47,786 --> 01:07:49,555
Mediocre.

1004
01:07:55,527 --> 01:07:57,598
Right. Well, you take her, then.

1005
01:07:58,064 --> 01:08:00,498
I have to say, I'm not particularly
impressed by your skills.

1006
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:01,702
She is worse than ever.

1007
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,171
Now, where's fucking Juanita
with the food?

1008

[sighs]

1011
01:08:23,989 --> 01:08:27,560
That cunt is really
starting to piss me off.

1012
01:08:30,529 --> 01:08:32,032
We need to sort this
right now.

1013
01:08:33,733 --> 01:08:35,035
Let's go speak to Sidney.

She's around.

1020
01:09:11,304 --> 01:09:14,208
[Sidney] Well, that was the
last of the five-star hotels.

1021
01:09:14,806 --> 01:09:19,145
I really can't see her slumming it
in some squalid motel, can you?

1022
01:09:19,578 --> 01:09:21,681
She is, if nothing else, a lady.

1023
01:09:22,549 --> 01:09:24,952
Take me somewhere.
I want to get fucked up.

1024
01:09:27,153 --> 01:09:29,156

01:10:16,035 --> 01:10:19,572
Thank you, Kim Kim.
Oh, you are a good puppy.

1030
01:10:23,209 --> 01:10:25,879
- Evening.
- Harry.

1031
01:10:26,211 --> 01:10:28,745
Oh, my word,
how wonderful to see you.

1032
01:10:28,747 --> 01:10:31,585
- I've been looking everywhere for you.
- Really?

1033
01:10:32,218 --> 01:10:34,285
Tea? Tea.
You'll have some tea.

1034
01:10:34,287 --> 01:10:36,757
Kim Kim,
fetch some tea for the lady.

1035

Oh, and Kim Kim, uh,

- [Harry] Sidney, darling?
- [Sidney] Hmm?

1038
01:11:00,947 --> 01:11:03,884
Something's come up,
something quite large.

1039
01:11:04,684 --> 01:11:07,187
I was hoping you might be
of some assistance.

1040
01:11:07,854 --> 01:11:10,724
Intriguing. Have some.

1041
01:11:12,190 --> 01:11:15,328

Oh, I...
Don't mind if I do.

[Sidney chuckles] Oh.

1051
01:12:09,448 --> 01:12:12,385
- Oh, that's plenty.
- Oh, no. Not quite.

- Mmm.

01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:26,667
Now, don't be wasteful.

You know what I love
about you, darling?

1057

You're a girl who knows
how to have a good...

You stole from me,
and then you leave me?

01:14:07,867 --> 01:14:11,134
Oh. I was just on my way
to pay you back.

Via Los Angeles?

1069
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:15,242
I got a little sidetracked.

1070
01:14:15,507 --> 01:14:18,545
You're good at so many things,
Harry, but not lying.

1071
01:14:19,511 --> 01:14:21,113
It was all Peter's fault.

1072
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:25,918
Yes, he blew all your cash
and made me run away.

1073
01:14:28,386 --> 01:14:30,023
But I knew you'd come for me.

1074
01:14:31,924 --> 01:14:33,160
God, I've missed you.

1075

Where is the money, Harry?

1076
01:14:37,563 --> 01:14:38,799
Well...

1077
01:14:40,933 --> 01:14:42,402
I'm working on it.

1078
01:14:43,402 --> 01:14:44,437
That's why I'm here.

1079
01:14:45,938 --> 01:14:47,107
So you don't have it.

[blade clicks]

1081

I love you, Harry.

1082
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:58,984
But now I'm going
to fuck you up.

1083
01:15:00,318 --> 01:15:05,088
There's a ring, a beautiful
one, worth millions of pounds.

1084
01:15:05,090 --> 01:15:06,323
And I'm gonna
nick it for you.

1085
01:15:06,325 --> 01:15:07,928
- You're lying.
- No.

1086
01:15:09,327 --> 01:15:10,496
It's for us.

1087
01:15:12,398 --> 01:15:13,533
Think about it.

1088
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:16,970
Me, you...

1089
01:15:18,069 --> 01:15:20,239
and millions of pounds.

[laughs]

1091
01:15:24,477 --> 01:15:26,276
And what about
the idiot you married?

1092
01:15:26,278 --> 01:15:31,248
[laughs] Oh, Peter. Oh, forget him.
Sidney can have him.

[laughing]

1094
01:15:33,385 --> 01:15:35,988
You really are a cold-hearted
bitch, aren't you?

1095
01:15:37,456 --> 01:15:38,592
Now...

1096
01:15:40,492 --> 01:15:41,527
come on, love.

1097
01:15:42,595 --> 01:15:44,564
Pour us a drink
and let's talk.

1098
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,167
I must have nodded off.

1099
01:16:22,702 --> 01:16:24,905
- What happened?
- It's all worked out.

1100
01:16:25,638 --> 01:16:27,340
I handled it expertly.

1101
01:16:28,541 --> 01:16:30,110
In what sense?

1102
01:16:32,044 --> 01:16:33,212
We're getting married.

1103
01:16:34,246 --> 01:16:36,516
Gabriel is leaving Jackie.

1104
01:16:38,216 --> 01:16:39,516
We're getting married.

1105
01:16:39,518 --> 01:16:41,618
- What, you and Jackie?
- Me and Gabriel.

1106
01:16:41,620 --> 01:16:43,119
Oh, I see.

Eh?

1111
01:16:56,568 --> 01:17:00,139
- Sidney's gonna stage a break-in.
- Well, Sidney's a fucking snake.

1112
01:17:00,438 --> 01:17:04,209
He's an expert in his field, so
I suggest you shut the fuck up.

1113
01:17:04,743 --> 01:17:05,577
Are you insane?

1114
01:17:06,479 --> 01:17:08,548
The next time I see you,
you'll be in jail.

1115
01:17:09,081 --> 01:17:11,117
- You going somewhere?

I'm a wreck.

1118
01:17:26,064 --> 01:17:29,102
I've never been so happy
in my life.

1119
01:17:29,667 --> 01:17:31,638
We have worked so hard for this.

1120
01:17:32,170 --> 01:17:33,472
So hard.

1121
01:17:35,041 --> 01:17:37,711
So hard. We've worked so hard.

1122
01:17:38,778 --> 01:17:40,013
So hard.

1123

Gabriel?

1124
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:43,716
Gabriel.

1125
01:17:45,251 --> 01:17:46,286
Ow.

Yes.

What did you take?

1132
01:18:22,087 --> 01:18:23,188
I don't know.

1133
01:18:24,122 --> 01:18:28,294
But it was very,
very, very good.

1134
01:18:30,362 --> 01:18:35,167
Oh, well. You might have saved some
for me, then, for fuck's sake.

1135
01:18:38,336 --> 01:18:39,705

What are you gonna do?

1138
01:18:47,645 --> 01:18:49,748
Cut her hand off
and stuff it up his cassock?

[laughing]

You think this'll work?

This won't work.

1142
01:18:57,656 --> 01:18:58,792
It's never gonna work.

We have no choice.

[Jackie]
I'm moving back to England.

1164
01:20:32,984 --> 01:20:35,688
I mean, you have no idea what I
have been through with Gabriel.

1165
01:20:35,955 --> 01:20:40,626
And to be humiliated like that,
in front of 500 million people.

1166

[groans] Conchita wants you to stay.

[Hans]
I have an announcement.

1168
01:20:48,099 --> 01:20:50,435
There's something you should
know about this woman who...

1169
01:20:52,737 --> 01:20:56,441
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know. He seemed upset.

1170
01:20:56,841 --> 01:20:58,411
I don't blame him.
What was he saying?

1171
01:20:59,245 --> 01:21:00,779
Something about Conchita.

1172
01:21:03,514 --> 01:21:06,783
Conchita knows,
and that's why she's so upset.

1173
01:21:06,785 --> 01:21:08,888
Gabriel has been
taking her to set.

1174
01:21:09,388 --> 01:21:12,925
And the three of them have been doing
it in his trailer and in his bed.

1175
01:21:14,026 --> 01:21:17,363
Right. I need to talk to her.
Come on. We're going.

1176
01:21:18,831 --> 01:21:21,301
What happened? Where am I?

1177
01:21:22,667 --> 01:21:23,702
Where is he?

1178
01:21:27,273 --> 01:21:28,775
He's a liar.

1179
01:21:31,910 --> 01:21:33,412
I'll kill him.

1180
01:21:35,546 --> 01:21:37,216
You will die.

1181
01:21:43,054 --> 01:21:45,457

- Gina, where are you?
- <i>I'm in the freezer. Peter locked me in.</i>

1190
01:22:06,612 --> 01:22:08,314
- Peter, is that true?
- No, no.

1191
01:22:10,581 --> 01:22:12,251
He said he loved me.

1192
01:22:12,684 --> 01:22:15,418
- Peter, you didn't.
- I'll kill you.

1193
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:17,553
Oh, Gina.
I know you're upset.

1194
01:22:17,555 --> 01:22:19,823
It's been a long day for everyone
and we are all very, very tired

1195
01:22:19,825 --> 01:22:21,557
and very emotional.

1196
01:22:21,559 --> 01:22:22,961
So why don't you go and
make us some hot cocoa?

1197
01:22:24,063 --> 01:22:26,466
Gabriel said
that he loved me.

1198
01:22:26,698 --> 01:22:28,565
Well, a second ago
you were in love with Peter.

1199
01:22:28,567 --> 01:22:30,002
It's all rather fickle,
I must say.

1200
01:22:30,635 --> 01:22:32,437
I'm really starting
to see your side of this.

1201
01:22:32,871 --> 01:22:33,906

[Vivien]
Gabriel and I are in love.

He's leaving you
because we're getting married.

1219
01:23:40,738 --> 01:23:42,442
I didn't say
I was leaving her.

1220
01:23:43,041 --> 01:23:45,008
- You said you loved me.
- He loves me.

Who is she? You're also

- Give me the ring. Now.
- [Jackie] What?

1233
01:24:36,828 --> 01:24:38,027
Give it to me or I shoot him.

Yes, go ahead. Be my guest.

1235

It's not in her possession.

1236

She fucked me.

Did she?
I am happy for you.

I suggest we start
in the kitchen.

Lots of hiding places there.

1249

I'll light it.

So, let me get this straight.

Who's getting fucked over
on this one, me or Irina?

Darling, I was just
trying to keep her sweet.

Oh, well, great work on that one.
Well done, mate.

Got the ring.
Just like I promised.

Peter, darling,
I really need your help.

the gun down now.

And I'll throw you the ring.
