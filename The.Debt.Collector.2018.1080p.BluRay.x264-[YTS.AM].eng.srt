VENICEAnsar..Srt

2
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,768
- He is here? - You know I do.

3
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:25,438
Can you call it? We would talk.

4
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:31,068
The class ended for today, boys.

5
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,863
Unless you want to sign up for the next.

6
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:39,827
- Do you know French? I like you. - Really?

7
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:41,996
But you can not run a business for nothing.

8
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:43,539
We do.

9
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:47,335
Our schools give profit but your traditional teaching

10
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,546
- is becoming more obsolete day. - Seriously? Why?

11
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,966
Why do you spread black belts like candy?

12
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:56,594
Hears! Tell him keep the tape measure.

13
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,596
It's just a matter of time, French.

14
00:02:59,472 --> 00:03:01,307
I have cash here today.

15
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,477
I can pay for you to transfer the rent to my account.

16
00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:08,022
You can leave a rich man! It is not a shame.

17
00:03:09,065 --> 00:03:11,692
- What do you say? - I mean you say stupid things.

18
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:16,405
French, ten thousand US dollars will buy your contract today.

19
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:18,991
Next week will offer seven o'clock.

20
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:20,618
The following five.

21
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,953
You see where it goes?

22
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:26,165
Would you mind taking my tatami feet?

23
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:28,584
For once in life, making a smart decision.

24
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:33,255
I said to take out my shoes tatami.

25
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:34,674
Or what?

26
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,474
We could do it the old, right?

27
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:45,059
Yes?

28
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:48,187
You and I could do a little dance on the mat.

29
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:50,314
See who wins.

30
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:54,235
If you win, well, I'm moving today.

31
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:56,320
But if I win,

32
00:03:56,737 --> 00:04:01,742
Largan and you three are not reappear here.

33
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:08,332
- You wanna fight me? - I will face the three idiots.

34
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:12,420
How in a kung fu movie?

35
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:16,966
Yes, that's right, friend. As a kung fu movie.

36
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:21,887
Let's go then.

37
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:24,890
Very good!

38
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:11,664
- How long I was passed out? - It's Tuesday friend.

39
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:14,125
Leave the ice on the nose. You'll be fine.

40
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,384
Close the door behind you, okay?

41
00:06:27,722 --> 00:06:29,015
Your kick back ...

42
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:31,851
It is very sloppy, French.

43
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:34,979
Yeah right if.

44
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:39,525
FINAL WARNING

45
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,864
That was a great show, French.

46
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:47,408
Hopefully not the place again and catch fire.

47
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:49,368
My insurance just defeated.

48
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:53,080
- You're in trouble, right? - Yes, you could say that.

49
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,669
I guess you did not talk with your man, do not you, Alex?

50
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:01,756
I mean, I could really use the extra money.

51
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:03,966
It's not for you.

52
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:07,470
You're a tough guy. You are also a good man.

53
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:10,431
I'm not so good, dude. You saw what I did, right?

54
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:12,993
French, your life would be much easier if shalt cause the rent.

55
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:15,811
Please! Why ten thousand? What shall I do with ten thousand?

56
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,855
I pay the bank first.

57
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,359
Then I'll have to buy a car, pay the rent and then what?

58
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:24,028
It's my gym. I built everything from scratch.

59
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:27,239
I myself revokes those walls. I cut the tatami.

60
00:07:27,365 --> 00:07:31,243
I worked very hard to come and destroy all those morons.

61
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:38,834
Come on, buddy, I need your help. I'll do whatever it takes to preserve this.

62
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:40,252
French...

63
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,051
People say that all the time, but rarely serious.

64
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:51,138
I'm serious. I am willing.

65
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:54,558
This kind of work does not give you a better life.

66
00:07:54,767 --> 00:07:56,977
It's good money, but it has a price.

67
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,979
It requires your consciousness.

68
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:02,775
I'm your friend, I will not let you get into this, French.

69
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:05,736
I am already big, Alex. I can take care of myself.

70
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,947
I remember you said that.

71
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:10,741
Not really up to me.

72
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:13,035
Tommy will have to sell.

73
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:16,455
- Tommy? - Yes, Tommy. It is your business.

74
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:19,166
Nobody works for Tommy if he does not approve.

75
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,710
I'll introduce you,

76
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:24,338
but you have to convince him that you are fit for work.

77
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:26,674
Thanks Alex.

78
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,470
Do not thank me, French. Not that kind of work.

79
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,972
I know you're there, French! I heard it on the fire escape.

80
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:16,724
You're wearing three-month delay!

81
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:19,560
I need to call a little cretins to charge you.

82
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:23,397
The gym is loose, but I hope to rebound.

83
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:26,025
Who cares? Pay me!

84
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,903
Yes very good. Give me a week. Yes? One week.

85
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:32,114
Meanwhile, you could fix the place of garbage!

86
00:09:32,323 --> 00:09:34,241
Pay the damn rent!

87
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:36,327
Failed!

88
00:09:38,037 --> 00:09:39,330
If, according.

89
00:09:54,387 --> 00:09:57,223
Watch how you behave. No fanfarronees, hurts you.

90
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,393
Speak softly, do you pay attention.

91
00:10:01,686 --> 00:10:03,437
Look at anyone who has real power.

92
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:07,233
They do not make extravagant gestures. They are terse, concise.

93
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:11,987
And above all, avoid eye contact.

94
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:14,448
Why?

95
00:10:15,491 --> 00:10:17,284
Because that's your trump card.

96
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,745
Save it for when you want to make something clear.

97
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,832
And do not get a reputation. Leave it to me.

98
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:26,377
I have a team of lawyers available 24 hours, you do not.

99
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:29,422
Just tell them to make charges for Tommy.

100
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:31,257
My name is all you need.

101
00:10:33,676 --> 00:10:35,011
You know take care of yourself?

102
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:36,512
Yes.

103
00:10:36,554 --> 00:10:38,347
Speak up other collections do for me.

104
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,141
Yes, I take care of myself.

105
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:44,562
I was a paratrooper in the service of his majesty, 15 years.

106
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:47,898
I saw a lot of shootings and brawls, then ...

107
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:50,735
- yes, I can do it. - Are you sure?

108
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:53,612
The roads that will cross the doors you call,

109
00:10:53,738 --> 00:10:56,240
They are far from His Majesty's service.

110
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:58,909
Escuche, Sr. Kowalski,

111
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,455
I need this job.

112
00:11:02,872 --> 00:11:05,082
You do not have to worry about me.

113
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:07,626
I've been fighting since I can remember

114
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,670
and I will leave one or two skulls if necessary.

115
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:11,130
I'll keep it in mind.

116
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:15,760
I have a man who does not mind sharing the Commission.

117
00:11:15,885 --> 00:11:17,553
He has a lot of work this week,

118
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:19,847
so it's a good time to learn the craft.

119
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:24,226
Perhaps he comes from a long spree, but it is one of the best.

120
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:27,313
- Seem right. - And buy yourself a nice suit.

121
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:29,732
You must look professional when represent me.

122
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:32,526
FRIDAY

123
00:11:51,796 --> 00:11:52,796
Dammit.

124
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:29,125
- You're early. - It is nine o'clock.

125
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:31,335
Goes up.

126
00:12:47,727 --> 00:12:49,270
Yes, you'll get used.

127
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:52,189
I'm Sue.

128
00:12:53,691 --> 00:12:54,775
French.

129
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:55,817
You do not look French.

130
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:57,945
I'm not.

131
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,698
¿Tommy speech made you dress when you represent?

132
00:13:00,823 --> 00:13:02,283
He did, actually.

133
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:07,621
Do you have the list of the commission?

134
00:13:15,171 --> 00:13:17,840
Skies, Tommy likes to assert your money, right?

135
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:19,508
It's okay,

136
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:22,136
but tell me, how did so many jobs?

137
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:25,806
Actually, no, friend. This is my first day.

138
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,476
Is not it great?

139
00:13:29,352 --> 00:13:30,811
I'll be honest with you, rookie.

140
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:34,190
It is not easy to earn a living. We earn it the hard way.

141
00:13:34,315 --> 00:13:35,733
Okay, because I'm working.

142
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:39,195
I do not need a worker, but someone brave and fast.

143
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:40,738
You're lucky, I have both.

144
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:42,156
- Agree? - You have it?

145
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:44,158
- Yes because? Are you going to a gym?

146
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:47,370
Look, pal, I manage, yes?

147
00:13:47,495 --> 00:13:49,246
No need to worry I'll cover you.

148
00:13:49,372 --> 00:13:52,708
You better. Or this society will be very brief.

149
00:13:53,918 --> 00:13:55,836
I could use a coffee well.

150
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:59,048
Leads you. I have a headache.

151
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:07,056
- Have you drove a car like that? - I never saw a car like that, friend.

152
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:09,684
Treat it with the respect it deserves.

153
00:14:10,101 --> 00:14:11,519
And do me a favor,

154
00:14:12,353 --> 00:14:14,105
careful with the tires.

155
00:14:14,647 --> 00:14:15,856
Anything else?

156
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:18,234
Yes, we drive on the right side here.

157
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:21,028
Yes, well said. I had never heard of that.

158
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,875
EAGLE ROCK WOOD AND FITTING

159
00:14:53,853 --> 00:14:55,229
- Hello. - How are you?

160
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,233
I want two pots and a coffee, please, okay?

161
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:00,568
Clear. With cream and sugar?

162
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:02,903
Yes please. One taste Italy and ...

163
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:05,197
one of vanilla.

164
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:09,076
Here, Frenchy.

165
00:15:17,043 --> 00:15:18,502
I brought one of vanilla.

166
00:15:21,005 --> 00:15:23,382
You know what? It's a bad idea to me, I think.

167
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:25,926
I'm fine. You want it?

168
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,887
I'm fine.

169
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:45,529
Here we go.

170
00:15:45,905 --> 00:15:48,449
Calle Vanowen, 27-31.

171
00:15:50,368 --> 00:15:51,786
No no. Save it.

172
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:54,789
I slept on last night lenses. I went to the middle.

173
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,293
Tommy did not tell me you were English.

174
00:16:00,628 --> 00:16:03,214
Yes, I'm English, but do not worry.

175
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:06,300
I have lived in EE. UU. enough to take it as a compliment.

176
00:16:06,384 --> 00:16:07,927
It was not.

177
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:12,181
Who do we have?

178
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:18,062
Oliver Waldstein. Ollie.
Debe 17.500 dólares.

179
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,022
What number next to the name there?

180
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:22,483
It's a ten. What is ten?

181
00:16:22,525 --> 00:16:24,610
Warning physical injury.

182
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:26,696
Does it say whether there were other charges of us?

183
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:28,747
The name beside the text says Serbian ...

184
00:16:28,906 --> 00:16:32,535
- The Serbian is a fucking idiot. - Why? Is that good or bad?

185
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,578
Neither. Come on?

186
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,717
Officially, we are intermediaries, not thugs.

187
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:53,931
But sometimes the boundaries are blurred and if that seems problematic ...

188
00:16:55,224 --> 00:16:57,018
takes away.

189
00:16:57,893 --> 00:16:59,395
It's easy to say.

190
00:17:00,271 --> 00:17:01,897
Not everyone can.

191
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:04,358
What if we are armed?

192
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:08,112
Probably are not. The role would tell.

193
00:17:08,237 --> 00:17:10,906
Do not worry, Doris. You'll be fine, okay?

194
00:17:23,586 --> 00:17:25,963
What do you do? You knock on the door, will you?

195
00:17:27,131 --> 00:17:28,466
Very good.

196
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:29,967
And then what?

197
00:17:30,051 --> 00:17:33,512
I do not know, ask if Ollie can go out and play or something.

198
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:41,763
It is CRAZY BUT IT'S MAGICAL. NO LIE IN YOUR PASSION.

199
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:53,407
Damn, Clive.

200
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:56,410
Shut your mouth. There's someone at the door. Be quiet.

201
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:00,915
One of them seems to Sue.

202
00:18:01,207 --> 00:18:04,335
- Are you kidding? - Sue? ¿Sue? What Sue?

203
00:18:05,378 --> 00:18:06,462
Who is she?

204
00:18:06,671 --> 00:18:09,924
- It's not a woman. Is a man. - strikes again. It was not strong.

205
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:15,513
Answers the door and say whatever, but stop them. Please!

206
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:17,932
They are cops?

207
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:20,393
I wish they were. Big charge for Tommy.

208
00:18:21,227 --> 00:18:23,688
- Is that a gun? - No, Trista is a gun!

209
00:18:23,771 --> 00:18:26,607
Where did you get it? And who is Big Tommy?

210
00:18:26,691 --> 00:18:30,611
- Stay here and serve. - I want you to go to the door

211
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:33,364
and ... Do not let them go, okay? Go.

212
00:18:33,489 --> 00:18:35,866
- Do not push me! - You will be fine!

213
00:18:40,788 --> 00:18:42,206
I told you no?

214
00:18:42,498 --> 00:18:44,917
Hi dear. Oliver came to see.

215
00:18:45,376 --> 00:18:46,627
He is not here.

216
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:48,713
We know he is there, then ...

217
00:18:48,796 --> 00:18:51,424
Get out, asshole. You got the wrong house.

218
00:18:59,265 --> 00:19:00,625
By the fund. Dude, for the background!

219
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:02,059
And, and, and.

220
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:05,521
- Give me the keys and go after it. - What?

221
00:19:05,646 --> 00:19:07,857
- Go, go! - What do you want? Go after him!

222
00:19:08,107 --> 00:19:11,694
I'll meet you at the ... Give me the keys, rookie! The keys!

223
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,280
holy heaven.

224
00:19:51,901 --> 00:19:53,402
He just shoot me!

225
00:19:53,611 --> 00:19:54,945
Where did he give you?

226
00:19:55,196 --> 00:19:56,572
- Do not! - Then go!

227
00:19:56,655 --> 00:19:58,657
- He just disp ...! - Go after him!

228
00:19:58,741 --> 00:20:00,409
- Dammit. - Go!

229
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:09,752
Motherfucker!

230
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:13,339
Put down the car! Get down, motherfucker!

231
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:15,216
Shit.

232
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:21,597
Shit!

233
00:20:24,183 --> 00:20:25,184
Dammit!

234
00:20:34,235 --> 00:20:36,612
- Shit! - Damn moron.

235
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:37,737
Dammit!

236
00:20:38,489 --> 00:20:41,033
- Dammit! - Sit down!

237
00:20:45,955 --> 00:20:47,456
So...

238
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,710
Police will arrive here in a minute, Oliver.

239
00:20:49,834 --> 00:20:51,728
Do I have to worry about what you're going to tell them?

240
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:52,670
No sir.

241
00:20:52,712 --> 00:20:55,172
You have fun with other people's money, Ollie.

242
00:20:55,464 --> 00:21:00,052
And yet there are the $ 17,500 that we should try.

243
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:02,847
- Yes sir! - Consider it a warning.

244
00:21:09,437 --> 00:21:12,440
- What's wrong? - I banged my head against the floor.

245
00:21:12,648 --> 00:21:15,776
And my feet are killing me. I did not know we were going to run as much.

246
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:18,446
You should have left your dancing shoes at home.

247
00:21:18,571 --> 00:21:21,741
- But I bought the suit, right? - You should not do it.

248
00:21:22,658 --> 00:21:26,120
Was it necessary to pull the door against the face of that girl?

249
00:21:26,287 --> 00:21:28,914
Actually, yes, it was necessary.

250
00:21:28,998 --> 00:21:31,208
Taking. Take us to the next.

251
00:21:49,435 --> 00:21:51,645
I thought we were bailiffs, right?

252
00:21:51,771 --> 00:21:53,189
We do not charge anything.

253
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,275
Ten is a warning prejudice.

254
00:21:56,817 --> 00:21:59,278
No commission, but Tommy pays us $ 300 each.

255
00:21:59,362 --> 00:22:00,613
So you already know.

256
00:22:00,946 --> 00:22:02,448
What's next on the list?

257
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:09,997
Harvey Small.
Bulevar Lankershim.

258
00:22:10,206 --> 00:22:12,416
You should have taken Sepúlveda. Frenchy, come on.

259
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:15,169
- Follow the program. - I am sorry. I am sorry.

260
00:22:15,294 --> 00:22:18,255
I'm still trying to recover from the shooting.

261
00:22:18,631 --> 00:22:22,176
I expect in Iraq. Do not expect it in the suburbs.

262
00:22:23,135 --> 00:22:25,554
Wait a minute. Saw action, right?

263
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:29,809
- Yes, I hurt some feelings. - So what is the problem?

264
00:22:30,935 --> 00:22:33,854
You said it, if they were armed, it would have said so.

265
00:22:34,146 --> 00:22:35,606
Yes? You remember?

266
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:38,192
A first friend. They were armed.

267
00:22:39,068 --> 00:22:41,112
So you were complaining there?

268
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:55,793
HARVEY SMALLS CAR FINANCING

269
00:22:55,835 --> 00:22:59,213
Okay, here we go. Harvey car financing.

270
00:22:59,255 --> 00:23:02,550
Yes, Harvey has a serious gambling problem.

271
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:04,176
Should more than one hundred thousand dollars,

272
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:07,221
that's a $ 4,000 commission number five.

273
00:23:07,346 --> 00:23:09,473
True, it's fine. The lower the number,

274
00:23:09,515 --> 00:23:11,726
harder the charge, but higher pay, right?

275
00:23:11,851 --> 00:23:15,938
Yes, and Harvey, an important type is created.

276
00:23:16,272 --> 00:23:18,941
He hired some cheap thugs South Los Angeles.

277
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:23,070
He was daring to put Tommy, what ... Tommy did not like.

278
00:23:25,448 --> 00:23:27,908
So we're going to charge $ 4,000 for this work.

279
00:23:27,992 --> 00:23:29,952
The last time came Crazy Alex and Serbian,

280
00:23:29,994 --> 00:23:31,754
but they left with their tails between their legs.

281
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:34,582
- What took Tommy? - it is the normal procedure.

282
00:23:34,623 --> 00:23:36,792
He climbed the commission and sent to us.

283
00:23:37,043 --> 00:23:39,670
Okay, let me clarify something, Sue, okay?

284
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:42,715
The last work was a ten, right? It must have been a walk

285
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,259
but I was shot, you ran over an idiot

286
00:23:45,343 --> 00:23:47,345
and dragged me from a moving car.

287
00:23:47,386 --> 00:23:48,763
Now this in five, okay?

288
00:23:48,804 --> 00:23:53,017
But you tell me that the Serbian Loco Alex and threw them thugs.

289
00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:54,977
I am sorry. I know I'm new at this,

290
00:23:55,019 --> 00:23:57,480
but I think Tommy should rethink its numbering system.

291
00:23:57,563 --> 00:23:58,606
Only that.

292
00:24:01,484 --> 00:24:04,236
Ten of a man is the fifth of another, I suppose.

293
00:24:04,362 --> 00:24:05,654
- Yes? - Yes.

294
00:24:05,905 --> 00:24:07,156
Yes.

295
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:23,047
The point is that we need to get some documents

296
00:24:23,172 --> 00:24:25,299
and then have everything ready.

297
00:24:25,508 --> 00:24:27,051
It's your turn.

298
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,220
Discúlpeme,

299
00:24:30,346 --> 00:24:32,431
We are looking for Harvey.

300
00:24:32,723 --> 00:24:34,323
What I can do for you gentlemen?

301
00:24:34,392 --> 00:24:35,726
- You're Harvey? - Do not.

302
00:24:35,851 --> 00:24:38,354
- Maybe you can take with Harvey. - He is busy.

303
00:24:38,437 --> 00:24:40,731
Is there something specific that you can help them?

304
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:45,986
Hey friend. Tell us where Harvey and go. Yes?

305
00:24:46,487 --> 00:24:49,240
Jeanette,
llama al Sr. Massey.

306
00:24:50,574 --> 00:24:52,910
I hope that this call is only Harvey.

307
00:24:56,872 --> 00:24:58,124
Hey, Sue.

308
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:07,675
It's time to show what you're capable, Frenchy.

309
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:12,013
It's just French ...

310
00:25:15,766 --> 00:25:16,976
Dammit.

311
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:29,739
No matter how much you pay for it,

312
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,980
I'll double, triple it so ...

313
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:37,413
OMG!

314
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:41,625
¡No!

315
00:25:43,044 --> 00:25:45,713
Give me your legs. Give me your fucking legs!

316
00:25:58,642 --> 00:26:00,144
I think you broke my nose!

317
00:26:00,269 --> 00:26:02,646
If I were you, I would not move me, Harvey.

318
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,069
¡Socorro!

319
00:26:08,986 --> 00:26:10,780
Are you going to do something, dammit?

320
00:26:11,155 --> 00:26:13,282
Excuse me! I'm watching Harvey, okay?

321
00:26:15,451 --> 00:26:17,453
- You can not get away with it! - Shut up now!

322
00:26:20,998 --> 00:26:21,998
¡No!

323
00:26:35,596 --> 00:26:37,556
CAR FINANCING CALL US NOW!

324
00:26:38,724 --> 00:26:40,101
No no.

325
00:26:41,477 --> 00:26:43,145
- Franchute. - No witnesses.

326
00:26:43,479 --> 00:26:46,107
They could go, leave me alone

327
00:26:46,232 --> 00:26:48,359
and I will make the best financial decision

328
00:26:48,484 --> 00:26:51,278
since I rented a limousine prom night.

329
00:26:53,406 --> 00:26:55,574
Look, tell Tommy that I was not here!

330
00:26:55,741 --> 00:26:59,286
Whatever the commission, I ... I cuadriplicaré.

331
00:26:59,829 --> 00:27:02,081
To be honest, Harvey, your commission is not so special.

332
00:27:02,748 --> 00:27:05,209
- What does he want to do? - You do not want to know.

333
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:08,421
What? What is it?

334
00:27:08,671 --> 00:27:10,256
- It is a ball joint. - Or two.

335
00:27:10,715 --> 00:27:14,510
- No, guys! No no no! - You let me?

336
00:27:24,562 --> 00:27:25,813
I'll call the police!

337
00:27:25,896 --> 00:27:26,772
OMG!

338
00:27:26,856 --> 00:27:28,941
You might want to discuss that with Harvey, Jeanette.

339
00:27:29,859 --> 00:27:34,280
No matter the police, Jeanette! Call an ambulance, dammit!

340
00:27:38,868 --> 00:27:42,663
- Okay, you park here. - Why? Not on the list.

341
00:27:42,788 --> 00:27:45,207
Relax, Frenchy. I have to pick something fast.

342
00:27:47,918 --> 00:27:50,212
- Dammit. Sorry. - What the hell did you do?

343
00:27:50,546 --> 00:27:54,383
What did you do? I only asked you to look after the tires, right?

344
00:27:57,094 --> 00:28:00,139
First, my friend, did lead me all the time.

345
00:28:00,222 --> 00:28:02,767
I take you everywhere like you're Mrs. Daisy

346
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:06,854
because you drank too much and lights and you smell like shit.

347
00:28:07,104 --> 00:28:10,066
Then I ask you to understand a job that never did.

348
00:28:10,191 --> 00:28:12,360
Then, after dodging bullets,

349
00:28:12,485 --> 00:28:16,072
They attacked me the biggest assholes I've ever seen in my life

350
00:28:16,155 --> 00:28:17,990
and it's not even noon!

351
00:28:18,074 --> 00:28:22,286
So forgive me if tires do not mind your damn boat!

352
00:28:24,246 --> 00:28:25,414
Did you finish the tantrum?

353
00:28:25,456 --> 00:28:28,626
No, I think not. Because I do not know if you paid attention,

354
00:28:28,751 --> 00:28:31,128
But I did go through a goddamn wall!

355
00:28:31,212 --> 00:28:32,963
I would not worry so much, boy.

356
00:28:33,005 --> 00:28:35,049
Especially after how you handled yourself.

357
00:28:35,132 --> 00:28:36,717
You're good at this.

358
00:28:36,842 --> 00:28:41,347
And sorry for making you drive my fancy Coup DeVille 1971.

359
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:44,392
I thought it would be a nice gesture to give you confidence on the first day,

360
00:28:44,517 --> 00:28:46,310
but I think it was not.

361
00:28:49,397 --> 00:28:50,523
It's a very nice car.

362
00:28:50,648 --> 00:28:53,567
When we pass this weekend, we do go this weekend,

363
00:28:53,693 --> 00:28:55,778
we can talk about my tires, right?

364
00:28:56,278 --> 00:28:58,989
That was five, right? Five.

365
00:29:00,449 --> 00:29:03,619
- More than five habitual fought. - Could you repeat it, friend.

366
00:29:04,453 --> 00:29:07,415
I'll tell you, Frenchy. You have a black, brother lake.

367
00:29:08,457 --> 00:29:10,459
You have overthrown those guys like a champ

368
00:29:10,584 --> 00:29:13,271
and like to train every day, I thought you'd appreciate the exercise.

369
00:29:13,295 --> 00:29:15,297
Actually, no, friend. I did not appreciate it.

370
00:29:17,174 --> 00:29:19,552
- Maybe a little. - Good.

371
00:29:20,261 --> 00:29:21,637
Be right back.

372
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,603
VIDEOCLUB VALLEY

373
00:29:42,158 --> 00:29:44,410
Wipe your face, you look like a vampire.

374
00:29:46,287 --> 00:29:47,287
Watch this.

375
00:29:47,329 --> 00:29:49,498
Exciting like a roller coaster FULL OF TIGERS!

376
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,417
THE RETURN OF THE LAST NINJA

377
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:54,420
Thrilling, is written with "C" right?

378
00:29:59,133 --> 00:30:00,426
- It was you? - Yes.

379
00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:01,677
Yes?

380
00:30:01,719 --> 00:30:03,554
- Shit. You have been to a movie? - Yes.

381
00:30:03,596 --> 00:30:04,513
Shit!

382
00:30:04,555 --> 00:30:06,098
A B-movie in the past.

383
00:30:06,223 --> 00:30:07,223
- Yes? - Yes.

384
00:30:07,266 --> 00:30:10,394
What a great friend, but it looks like crap.

385
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:13,564
Yes, it was, but at least I'm on the poster, right?

386
00:30:13,898 --> 00:30:15,441
It looks like you, friend.

387
00:30:15,566 --> 00:30:18,277
What did you do? They cut their eyes and stuck there, right?

388
00:30:18,402 --> 00:30:20,404
I'm hungry. Let's go eat something.

389
00:30:20,821 --> 00:30:22,615
You were a ninja, right?

390
00:30:33,209 --> 00:30:34,502
Gordon Karp.

391
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,506
What a horrible name, I hope it's a pseudonym.

392
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:43,511
This neighborhood is very nice.

393
00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:45,429
It should be. Fat is a deuce.

394
00:30:45,846 --> 00:30:49,308
Ten, five and two in the afternoon. It is a hard day.

395
00:30:49,975 --> 00:30:54,271
Gordo owe $ 40,000. We pay half, it's a good deal, right?

396
00:30:55,439 --> 00:30:58,317
Wait a minute. Harvey had a hundred thousand, right?

397
00:30:58,359 --> 00:30:59,944
But what was it? A five?

398
00:30:59,985 --> 00:31:03,280
This type should only $ 40,000 and is a deuce. How does it work?

399
00:31:03,406 --> 00:31:06,492
Tommy puts the numbers based on the level of violence.

400
00:31:06,534 --> 00:31:08,244
There is no logical reason, Frenchy,

401
00:31:08,327 --> 00:31:10,788
so do not waste gray matter trying to decipher it.

402
00:31:10,955 --> 00:31:12,373
Fat is a deuce.

403
00:31:12,873 --> 00:31:14,291
Bake it and take it.

404
00:31:14,417 --> 00:31:16,168
Did you bake and you take him?

405
00:31:16,293 --> 00:31:18,713
Yes. You do burn and you get the money.

406
00:31:20,089 --> 00:31:22,049
You do burn and you get the money ...

407
00:31:22,466 --> 00:31:23,759
Oh my God!

408
00:31:33,644 --> 00:31:34,937
What do you two want?

409
00:31:35,062 --> 00:31:37,273
Not you, queen bee. That is sure.

410
00:31:38,774 --> 00:31:39,774
What did you call me?

411
00:31:39,817 --> 00:31:43,070
For a big guy, you have beautiful eyes. You could be a model.

412
00:31:43,112 --> 00:31:45,364
It is better to come back on Halloween, clowns.

413
00:31:45,448 --> 00:31:47,783
Hey this guy. I eulogies ... no, Frenchy?

414
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:50,327
You should accept the compliment, friend. He does not say a lot.

415
00:31:50,411 --> 00:31:51,245
Yes.

416
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:52,496
I have things to do!

417
00:31:52,538 --> 00:31:55,499
I bet you can change a can. You're big!

418
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:58,753
There you two met row. Lucky, friend.

419
00:31:58,794 --> 00:32:00,546
Have to disappear, Dumb and Dumber.

420
00:32:00,671 --> 00:32:06,010
Okay, maybe we started badly. I'm Sue. He is French.

421
00:32:06,635 --> 00:32:08,429
Gordon came to see. He is?

422
00:32:08,554 --> 00:32:09,972
No, he is not here.

423
00:32:10,097 --> 00:32:14,477
My compliments are not good for you. Drop dead, Italian sh ...!

424
00:32:49,261 --> 00:32:51,263
- Gordie? - Do not say anything, Angelica.

425
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:54,475
Good morning, Mr. Karp, Ms. Karp.

426
00:32:54,642 --> 00:32:57,019
I suppose you both know why I came?

427
00:32:57,144 --> 00:32:58,312
- No no.

428
00:32:59,563 --> 00:33:01,023
Forty thousand.

429
00:33:01,315 --> 00:33:03,818
Yes! That is.

430
00:33:03,984 --> 00:33:06,696
Do not you take care of it, Gordie? Silly bastard.

431
00:33:08,322 --> 00:33:11,200
- Gosh, where is Manno? - What's going on here?

432
00:33:11,242 --> 00:33:13,869
Who do they think they are? Forajidas lonely star Are clearer?

433
00:33:14,036 --> 00:33:16,205
Do they come to my house and try to intimidate me?

434
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:19,291
Do you have any idea who I am? I'm a friend of Big Tommy!

435
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:22,294
Fat. Big work to Tommy, you fucking idiot.

436
00:33:22,586 --> 00:33:24,422
I guess that changes everything.

437
00:33:25,006 --> 00:33:27,008
Listen, tell me how much I pay

438
00:33:27,133 --> 00:33:29,552
and I will make sure they receive every penny,

439
00:33:29,593 --> 00:33:30,761
tomorrow at noon.

440
00:33:30,803 --> 00:33:32,013
This will be so, Gordo.

441
00:33:32,096 --> 00:33:35,850
You'll take Mr. French Wherever you keep all your money

442
00:33:35,975 --> 00:33:38,728
and thou shalt bring forth all the capital you can.

443
00:33:38,811 --> 00:33:41,897
Hopefully, when I tell him, he will not beat you up.

444
00:33:42,565 --> 00:33:44,734
The Ms. Karp can stay here with me.

445
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,737
If it does not hurt, maybe I start with her.

446
00:33:47,987 --> 00:33:49,321
Okay, dear?

447
00:33:49,405 --> 00:33:51,490
- He will not touch you, honey! - Fat...

448
00:33:51,907 --> 00:33:55,870
I've been doing this a long time. I'll do whatever it takes.

449
00:33:56,162 --> 00:33:58,414
- The safe is in the office. - Angelica!

450
00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:01,042
- Drop dead, Gordie! - That is, die, Gordie.

451
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:02,168
Come on.

452
00:34:16,974 --> 00:34:19,643
Look, I know I'm late. I can not help it!

453
00:34:19,769 --> 00:34:21,479
Postponed everything.

454
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,106
I do not pay no bills before the last notice.

455
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:26,525
That crazy to Angelica. No wonder, right?

456
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:29,111
- $ 40,000, Gordie. Come on. - Yes Yes Yes.

457
00:34:29,153 --> 00:34:30,613
You got a cut, right?

458
00:34:30,738 --> 00:34:33,115
A figure that would be enough, right? An agreement?

459
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,368
You'd I'll burst, Gordie!

460
00:34:35,493 --> 00:34:38,329
Stop negotiate and get the money!

461
00:34:38,537 --> 00:34:39,955
You earn a percentage, right?

462
00:34:40,122 --> 00:34:42,458
Hey, we could make a deal.

463
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:45,002
Five thousand for you and five for Tommy.

464
00:34:45,086 --> 00:34:47,963
You can buy a new suit with the $ 500 that he would pay you.

465
00:34:48,089 --> 00:34:48,923
Get up.

466
00:34:48,964 --> 00:34:50,341
- Yes? - Yes.

467
00:34:52,093 --> 00:34:53,260
Do you want more?

468
00:34:54,178 --> 00:34:55,638
Of course, why not?

469
00:34:57,556 --> 00:34:59,850
Your man was not a big bodyguard.

470
00:35:01,018 --> 00:35:02,478
Manno es mi lover,

471
00:35:03,479 --> 00:35:05,189
not my bodyguard.

472
00:35:06,857 --> 00:35:07,983
Really?

473
00:35:08,901 --> 00:35:11,153
Was he your gardener too?

474
00:35:13,406 --> 00:35:16,033
No, that vacancy is still available.

475
00:35:17,535 --> 00:35:20,705
I wonder ... Are you qualified?

476
00:35:29,505 --> 00:35:30,673
Come on, Gordie.

477
00:35:32,717 --> 00:35:34,093
¡Vamos, Gordie!

478
00:35:38,723 --> 00:35:41,017
Where is the key, Gordie? Where is the key?

479
00:35:41,142 --> 00:35:42,810
- Give me the key. - It's not there?

480
00:35:42,935 --> 00:35:44,687
No, it's not there! Where is the key?

481
00:35:44,729 --> 00:35:45,980
I do not remember, I'm nervous.

482
00:35:46,022 --> 00:35:49,025
- You're nervous, right? - Yes, I do not remember.

483
00:35:49,942 --> 00:35:52,820
Will not miss much your short-term memory, do not you, friend?

484
00:35:53,029 --> 00:35:55,990
Gordie, I do not have time for this. Where is the damn key?

485
00:35:56,907 --> 00:35:58,409
¡Date prisa!

486
00:35:59,994 --> 00:36:01,996
Is that? Give it to me. Come on!

487
00:36:02,455 --> 00:36:03,455
Dammit.

488
00:36:09,837 --> 00:36:11,547
What the hell is this?

489
00:36:11,714 --> 00:36:15,426
God, there are over one hundred thousand here, asshole masochist.

490
00:36:15,676 --> 00:36:18,113
You had the money from the start and chose to take a beating.

491
00:36:18,137 --> 00:36:19,430
What is your problem?

492
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,098
I am parsimonious.

493
00:36:21,682 --> 00:36:24,602
It's not a game, Gordie. Agree? It's not a game.

494
00:36:25,686 --> 00:36:28,689
You have to work more self-preservation. Do you hear me?

495
00:36:28,814 --> 00:36:30,649
- Yes Yes Yes. - Yes?

496
00:36:34,153 --> 00:36:35,654
Dammit.

497
00:37:08,896 --> 00:37:09,896
It's okay.

498
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,982
- You finished, right? - Yes Yes. I finished.

499
00:37:13,025 --> 00:37:15,528
You are very cute. You are good.

500
00:37:17,113 --> 00:37:18,406
Look at that, Frenchy.

501
00:37:18,489 --> 00:37:20,783
Das luck. This does not happen very often.

502
00:37:20,991 --> 00:37:22,410
Yes, I'm glad you enjoy it.

503
00:37:22,535 --> 00:37:25,329
Come on. Who do you spoiled the party? Yes.

504
00:37:27,581 --> 00:37:29,375
I know we had to be tough to type,

505
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,085
but you had to sleep with her?

506
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:33,587
Of course. She was very sexy.

507
00:37:33,754 --> 00:37:36,882
Opportunities and do not appear very often.

508
00:37:37,091 --> 00:37:38,926
- It's true, I guess. - Y?

509
00:37:39,677 --> 00:37:40,720
I do not know.

510
00:37:40,845 --> 00:37:43,806
I do not want to be the reason someone horrible day, that's all.

511
00:37:43,931 --> 00:37:45,850
Check your conscience, Jiminy Cricket.

512
00:37:45,891 --> 00:37:47,935
Or you have a long weekend, treasure.

513
00:37:47,977 --> 00:37:49,020
I'll keep it in mind.

514
00:37:49,061 --> 00:37:51,647
- she Not easily surrendered, right? - No, no, no, and understand it,

515
00:37:51,772 --> 00:37:54,150
the guy had enough money to be lender.

516
00:37:54,275 --> 00:37:55,443
No one owe.

517
00:37:56,027 --> 00:37:59,488
I still had to hit him, do not understand people sometimes.

518
00:37:59,572 --> 00:38:00,573
Tell me.

519
00:38:00,698 --> 00:38:02,884
Once I hung up the son of a guy by the window until paid.

520
00:38:02,908 --> 00:38:05,244
He had the money from the start. It was his own son.

521
00:38:08,706 --> 00:38:10,791
But you would not have dropped the child, right?

522
00:38:12,501 --> 00:38:14,503
Gosh, I hope not. I do not remember.

523
00:38:15,004 --> 00:38:17,465
But I admit that I was lazy that day.

524
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:19,467
I should have hung father.

525
00:38:22,595 --> 00:38:25,598
Moral principles in this business are like Granada uninsured.

526
00:38:47,787 --> 00:38:50,414
- Do you still have the energy, Frenchy? - Of course.

527
00:38:50,539 --> 00:38:51,665
Are they.

528
00:38:52,083 --> 00:38:54,752
Come on, Sue. These guys are not on our list, right?

529
00:38:54,877 --> 00:38:56,420
We have the money, right?

530
00:38:56,545 --> 00:38:58,464
We gain nothing metiéndonos with these idiots.

531
00:38:58,673 --> 00:39:00,633
Yes, we could run away from these thugs,

532
00:39:00,758 --> 00:39:03,135
but if Tommy finds out, maybe we should keep running.

533
00:39:03,803 --> 00:39:06,722
Besides, I hate to be the one to tell you,

534
00:39:06,931 --> 00:39:09,475
but part of your job is to cover me, okay?

535
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:12,978
Yes, but do not leave everything to me this time, would you?

536
00:40:54,789 --> 00:40:56,499
- Yes? - Yes.

537
00:40:58,751 --> 00:40:59,751
Shit.

538
00:41:08,469 --> 00:41:09,469
Dammit.

539
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,943
Number 127 ...

540
00:41:25,027 --> 00:41:28,447
127, your meal is ready. And I asked 129 ...

541
00:41:29,657 --> 00:41:31,701
129, your meal is ready.

542
00:41:31,826 --> 00:41:34,328
I will tell you something. Today was unreal to me.

543
00:41:35,454 --> 00:41:37,164
Is it always?

544
00:41:37,415 --> 00:41:38,958
No, I must be frank, Frenchy.

545
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,640
Today we had more than our share.

546
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:42,670
Yes, you can repeat it. Did you see my costume?

547
00:41:42,712 --> 00:41:44,088
Yes, I saw your suit.

548
00:41:44,171 --> 00:41:46,731
It's the cheapest suit I've ever seen. I would not worry about it.

549
00:41:46,757 --> 00:41:49,468
This suit cost me $ 99, Tie included.

550
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:52,430
You look like a used car salesman. Get rid of it. Chuck it.

551
00:41:52,513 --> 00:41:54,724
I will use my kimono, yes? Dammit.

552
00:41:54,932 --> 00:41:57,268
I did not have to break as many skulls in Iraq.

553
00:41:57,643 --> 00:41:59,395
Come on. It was not so bad, right?

554
00:41:59,812 --> 00:42:02,523
The first day of all is difficult. You'll get used to it.

555
00:42:02,857 --> 00:42:04,984
As for your technique, it was MMA, okay?

556
00:42:05,109 --> 00:42:06,610
Yes, MMA.

557
00:42:07,278 --> 00:42:09,697
You're a boxer, right? Your footwork is very good.

558
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,490
Yes, I have the strength yet, but ...

559
00:42:11,824 --> 00:42:14,285
I lost speed while.

560
00:42:15,161 --> 00:42:17,413
I'll tell you, Frenchy. Call it a day.

561
00:42:17,788 --> 00:42:19,999
Take me home and pick me up in the morning.

562
00:42:26,005 --> 00:42:28,174
Hey honey! Can you come get this, please?

563
00:42:28,215 --> 00:42:29,467
I'm coming, sir!

564
00:42:57,661 --> 00:42:58,788
Dammit.

565
00:43:07,797 --> 00:43:09,507
What's on the menu today?

566
00:43:09,632 --> 00:43:12,343
Coco got me working on the Westside.

567
00:43:12,802 --> 00:43:15,388
Two Arab sheiks or something.

568
00:43:16,055 --> 00:43:17,515
A lot of money.

569
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:24,188
Hey, wait a minute. Come here, look what I found.

570
00:43:24,355 --> 00:43:25,356
What?

571
00:43:27,942 --> 00:43:29,402
Is that?

572
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:32,655
Of course. That's me. I did wrong in this film.

573
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:34,740
So you write exciting?

574
00:43:37,201 --> 00:43:39,662
Yes, at that time it was different, you know?

575
00:43:40,413 --> 00:43:42,373
They are also low budget, you know how they are.

576
00:43:42,456 --> 00:43:43,642
SECONDS WITH LOLA sticky THROAT

577
00:43:43,666 --> 00:43:44,750
Yes I know.

578
00:43:46,752 --> 00:43:48,921
Hey, dear,

579
00:43:49,422 --> 00:43:52,758
I could use some green.

580
00:43:53,551 --> 00:43:54,802
How much do you need, honey?

581
00:43:56,345 --> 00:43:58,389
You could use about $ 300.

582
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:04,020
Here you have.

583
00:44:04,186 --> 00:44:05,938
- Thank you. - Let me get on the closure.

584
00:44:08,899 --> 00:44:10,026
Yes.

585
00:44:11,152 --> 00:44:13,738
Hey, I want you to be careful.

586
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,865
Barbosa called me today.

587
00:44:17,158 --> 00:44:19,618
He was asking about you.

588
00:44:20,411 --> 00:44:23,539
- Thats weird. What did he want? - Nothing, really, but ...

589
00:44:23,581 --> 00:44:26,834
I know well that scoundrel and I know you do not want to mess with him.

590
00:44:27,835 --> 00:44:29,337
He hurt a lot of people.

591
00:44:30,421 --> 00:44:33,090
Do not worry, I'll be careful. Thank you dear.

592
00:44:33,883 --> 00:44:35,760
SATURDAY

593
00:44:50,775 --> 00:44:53,152
- Hi, Sean. How are you? - Hi, Sue. How are you?

594
00:44:53,235 --> 00:44:56,113
Lola must be working. Is she coming today?

595
00:44:56,238 --> 00:44:57,990
You know how it is. She will come.

596
00:44:58,157 --> 00:44:59,700
One for the account, okay?

597
00:45:00,242 --> 00:45:03,120
- How's business going? - go well, how are you?

598
00:45:03,245 --> 00:45:05,122
- I'm fine, friend, health. - Health.

599
00:45:13,047 --> 00:45:14,215
You're good?

600
00:45:14,757 --> 00:45:15,757
Come on.

601
00:45:40,408 --> 00:45:42,159
What are you selling? Let me see.

602
00:45:42,451 --> 00:45:43,494
It is already sold.

603
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:46,205
Do not ask that. Let me see, I see what you sell.

604
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,461
What was it called?

605
00:45:52,878 --> 00:45:56,007
It is a German MP40. I doubt you've seen one.

606
00:45:56,132 --> 00:45:57,133
You doubt it?

607
00:45:57,216 --> 00:45:59,427
Do not be so condescending, miserable pedophile.

608
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:01,846
- Are you working on my order? - Do not worry, Tommy.

609
00:46:01,971 --> 00:46:04,265
It is a rare piece. It is hard to find.

610
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:06,684
Better to smile if you're gonna talk like that.

611
00:46:08,102 --> 00:46:10,521
Good job guys. In the three accounts.

612
00:46:12,648 --> 00:46:15,192
I just talked to Rick people in Reno.

613
00:46:16,235 --> 00:46:17,903
Harvey paid it all.

614
00:46:18,487 --> 00:46:21,699
So our reserves rose after yesterday.

615
00:46:21,866 --> 00:46:24,702
I will give this cute little job that fell into my hands.

616
00:46:25,578 --> 00:46:26,829
Hi boss.

617
00:46:27,705 --> 00:46:30,499
Hello, French. I knew you in this.

618
00:46:30,666 --> 00:46:31,500
Hello Friend.

619
00:46:31,625 --> 00:46:34,337
But it is a pity that you put this dirty fossil pee.

620
00:46:34,462 --> 00:46:37,173
- How are you, Alex? - I'm fine.

621
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:39,508
By the way, we got the call about Harvey.

622
00:46:39,633 --> 00:46:42,219
Neglected. We did the work for you yesterday, then ...

623
00:46:42,345 --> 00:46:44,555
Does not matter. Do you have it, Father?

624
00:46:45,931 --> 00:46:47,475
Let's go out?

625
00:46:47,725 --> 00:46:50,227
Clear. Tommy, French.

626
00:46:50,353 --> 00:46:52,229
Buy a cute copy, Alex. Very expensive.

627
00:46:52,271 --> 00:46:54,273
I understand you need a larger arsenal

628
00:46:54,357 --> 00:46:57,026
how strong must have shaken the cage, you know?

629
00:46:57,151 --> 00:46:59,820
I am sorry. It is a terrible thing to lose courage.

630
00:47:00,154 --> 00:47:01,697
Fuck, man.

631
00:47:01,822 --> 00:47:04,158
I'll show my courage when you're ready.

632
00:47:04,325 --> 00:47:06,077
I greet Lola from you.

633
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:08,621
Keep drinking falling asleep, Susan,

634
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:11,874
and remember something, when you kiss,

635
00:47:12,166 --> 00:47:14,585
I had him in the mouth after stuffing it into the ...

636
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:15,710
After.

637
00:47:17,129 --> 00:47:20,216
You have class, Alex. Very classy. Enjoy the day.

638
00:47:20,466 --> 00:47:21,550
Tommy.

639
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:28,307
- You're good? - I'm fine, Tommy.

640
00:47:28,474 --> 00:47:30,351
- You can drive? - Come on.

641
00:47:30,518 --> 00:47:32,228
Very good. We talk about the work.

642
00:47:32,353 --> 00:47:33,729
In the Cadillac.

643
00:47:34,689 --> 00:47:36,857
Actually, Frenchie, do you mind driving?

644
00:47:39,443 --> 00:47:41,904
- On the other lane, right? - Yes very good.

645
00:47:43,989 --> 00:47:46,450
I thought you had said that you will buy a nice suit.

646
00:47:47,034 --> 00:47:49,704
The suit did not last the first day, Tommy.

647
00:47:51,956 --> 00:47:52,956
Good,

648
00:47:53,416 --> 00:47:55,626
I heard good things about yesterday.

649
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:58,879
Sue said you behaved like a professional.

650
00:48:00,172 --> 00:48:03,050
- Yes thanks. - Did you enjoy that?

651
00:48:03,676 --> 00:48:06,178
He had its ups and downs but,

652
00:48:06,595 --> 00:48:07,680
it was good.

653
00:48:07,805 --> 00:48:11,183
All right? Not the brightest review.

654
00:48:13,102 --> 00:48:14,687
How about?

655
00:48:14,895 --> 00:48:18,274
- He has potential, Tommy. - The former potential.

656
00:49:05,237 --> 00:49:07,490
- Where is the? - In his lair.

657
00:49:23,964 --> 00:49:25,299
¡Tommy!

658
00:49:25,549 --> 00:49:29,512
- Tommy, my friend. - Good to see you, friend.

659
00:49:29,804 --> 00:49:31,972
Why not sit down and get comfortable?

660
00:49:32,139 --> 00:49:35,434
Friends, do you want to eat, drink?

661
00:49:35,726 --> 00:49:37,019
Anything to calm your nerves?

662
00:49:37,228 --> 00:49:38,771
My nerves are fine.

663
00:49:40,106 --> 00:49:41,148
How are you?

664
00:49:41,273 --> 00:49:44,318
Dude, I was never a fan of the morning.

665
00:49:44,777 --> 00:49:46,779
I do my best work at night.

666
00:49:46,987 --> 00:49:48,698
But I get out of bed for you, Tommy.

667
00:49:48,781 --> 00:49:49,990
You know why?

668
00:49:50,324 --> 00:49:52,076
Because we are together, right?

669
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:53,869
We have a history.

670
00:49:54,245 --> 00:49:56,038
That is very important to me.

671
00:49:57,123 --> 00:49:59,625
- It means I can trust you. - Of course.

672
00:50:01,168 --> 00:50:02,712
Do you remember Sue?

673
00:50:03,212 --> 00:50:04,672
Of course yes.

674
00:50:05,172 --> 00:50:07,258
How are you, Chico de Oro?

675
00:50:07,717 --> 00:50:09,093
I manage.

676
00:50:09,218 --> 00:50:12,138
He is French. The man I was talking about.

677
00:50:12,304 --> 00:50:15,433
- Pleased to meet you, Frenchy. - Nice to meet you too.

678
00:50:15,683 --> 00:50:17,059
It's just French, by the way.

679
00:50:17,184 --> 00:50:20,062
What is that English accent and franchute name?

680
00:50:20,104 --> 00:50:21,814
It's a man's world!

681
00:50:22,023 --> 00:50:23,524
Yes, I am different.

682
00:50:23,649 --> 00:50:28,362
- Of course. Mr. French. - still only French ...

683
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:30,698
What do you have for us, Barbosa?

684
00:50:30,823 --> 00:50:34,535
I have this bastard Irish small and charming.

685
00:50:34,869 --> 00:50:37,371
He ran one of my dives in Melrose.

686
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:42,168
I discovered that stole my box till you drop.

687
00:50:42,877 --> 00:50:48,174
This cretin was taking more than double tip.

688
00:50:48,507 --> 00:50:50,801
- You know what it means? - That happens.

689
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:54,930
I can be a reverend bastard! Ask my staff.

690
00:50:55,056 --> 00:50:56,557
Ask them to my girls.

691
00:50:56,682 --> 00:51:00,728
Tome este idiot, the ASEE, the freighter.

692
00:51:00,853 --> 00:51:02,688
I wiped my ass!

693
00:51:02,813 --> 00:51:07,026
This is unfortunate and bites the hand that feeds him.

694
00:51:07,485 --> 00:51:08,611
¡Amanda!

695
00:51:10,654 --> 00:51:11,739
Where are you going?

696
00:51:12,198 --> 00:51:14,575
You must stay. Listen out.

697
00:51:15,284 --> 00:51:20,623
I want everyone to know that you can not steal

698
00:51:21,832 --> 00:51:23,918
a Barbosa Fabioso.

699
00:51:24,585 --> 00:51:26,671
Not without paying the piper.

700
00:51:26,837 --> 00:51:28,589
How I fuck.

701
00:51:29,131 --> 00:51:31,133
Nurses language.

702
00:51:31,717 --> 00:51:35,304
It was not what you told me when I asked for my hand, my love.

703
00:51:36,138 --> 00:51:39,350
How much did you steal? The approximate figure you figure.

704
00:51:39,475 --> 00:51:41,102
I'm sorry, what does that make?

705
00:51:41,143 --> 00:51:43,145
We work by percentage.

706
00:51:43,437 --> 00:51:44,897
You get him, right?

707
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:47,274
You must have an idea of ​​how it was.

708
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,860
What has this to do with the way you do business?

709
00:51:49,985 --> 00:51:53,823
I'll pay a hefty sum in advance.

710
00:51:55,074 --> 00:51:56,992
I think I'll take that drink.

711
00:52:03,958 --> 00:52:05,918
What are we dealing with here?

712
00:52:06,961 --> 00:52:08,254
Amanda,

713
00:52:08,546 --> 00:52:10,673
Why do not you take your girls to the pool?

714
00:52:10,756 --> 00:52:12,258
Swim a little.

715
00:52:16,971 --> 00:52:19,974
This is a personal problem and I need you to handle.

716
00:52:20,141 --> 00:52:21,308
So can we proceed?

717
00:52:21,392 --> 00:52:24,478
The boys find it. Remember, we have a scale.

718
00:52:24,729 --> 00:52:29,358
One is the strongest and ten beating is a stern warning.

719
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:33,112
- Where did you put this guy? - Number one, dammit!

720
00:52:33,237 --> 00:52:36,157
That will cost twenty thousand dollars. Half in advance,

721
00:52:36,282 --> 00:52:38,743
- the rest afterwards. - Billy!

722
00:52:46,125 --> 00:52:47,668
Taking. Give me two.

723
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:57,428
That's his full name and his last job.

724
00:52:57,636 --> 00:52:59,263
It should be enough to start.

725
00:52:59,388 --> 00:53:00,514
Sue,

726
00:53:01,265 --> 00:53:05,019
Mr. French, pleased to meet you.

727
00:53:21,786 --> 00:53:24,080
What do you think of this type Barbosa?

728
00:53:24,413 --> 00:53:26,290
Typical of his tavern. You know?

729
00:53:26,415 --> 00:53:29,794
You think you can pay to get out of trouble. And to power.

730
00:53:30,086 --> 00:53:33,673
Twenty thousand. Twenty thousand to slap a guy.

731
00:53:33,714 --> 00:53:35,424
I do not know, no matter how much I win

732
00:53:35,466 --> 00:53:37,677
I never pay to do my dirty work.

733
00:53:37,718 --> 00:53:39,845
I begin to feel sorry for this guy Connor.

734
00:53:39,887 --> 00:53:42,765
I learned long ago to treat these guys like meat.

735
00:53:42,848 --> 00:53:45,518
Yes I know. I'm trying to get into that wave.

736
00:53:45,685 --> 00:53:47,019
So what do you think?

737
00:53:47,061 --> 00:53:50,147
Want to check the address of the last club where he worked?

738
00:53:50,356 --> 00:53:51,440
Give me a second.

739
00:53:52,191 --> 00:53:53,734
Here to the right.

740
00:53:54,443 --> 00:53:57,113
Would not it be better to call these places first?

741
00:53:57,238 --> 00:53:59,615
I think you would save a fortune on gasoline.

742
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:02,159
Some collectors like to use the phones.

743
00:54:02,243 --> 00:54:03,327
Not me, Frenchy.

744
00:54:03,369 --> 00:54:05,746
I like to go out. Take a little walk.

745
00:54:05,788 --> 00:54:06,997
Knocking on a door

746
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:09,875
I get more information than those idiots with twenty calls.

747
00:54:10,084 --> 00:54:11,502
Hope you're right.

748
00:54:11,752 --> 00:54:13,379
We need to fill the tank again.

749
00:54:14,296 --> 00:54:16,090
Because you have a heavy foot.

750
00:54:16,257 --> 00:54:17,591
Petting pedal.

751
00:54:19,468 --> 00:54:20,886
It's here then, yeah?

752
00:54:21,554 --> 00:54:23,264
Yes, this is good.

753
00:54:37,069 --> 00:54:38,946
- Are you sure it's here? - Yes.

754
00:54:40,781 --> 00:54:42,742
It's okay. You have the keys?

755
00:54:49,623 --> 00:54:53,169
They do not saw the sign out there? The one that says closed?

756
00:54:53,419 --> 00:54:56,422
No, we just want to talk. It's very fast.

757
00:54:56,881 --> 00:54:57,923
Yes.

758
00:54:58,924 --> 00:55:02,511
Well, obviously not read or understand English.

759
00:55:02,887 --> 00:55:05,348
It is closed, I'm busy. Agree?

760
00:55:05,473 --> 00:55:07,433
So do me a favor and get out.

761
00:55:07,725 --> 00:55:11,020
You see, why do you have to be so rude and insulting?

762
00:55:11,145 --> 00:55:14,023
- Since no manners. - It must be a tough guy, Sue.

763
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:16,525
What do you think, you want to get out and enter again?

764
00:55:16,567 --> 00:55:19,111
Would you like that, buddy? Do you bother?

765
00:55:19,612 --> 00:55:20,612
It's okay.

766
00:55:20,946 --> 00:55:23,282
You want good manners? DARE is.

767
00:55:23,783 --> 00:55:26,410
Were so kind, gentlemen,

768
00:55:26,535 --> 00:55:31,874
retiring because of our facility? Please...

769
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:34,085
motherfucker.

770
00:55:42,093 --> 00:55:44,011
The ruined now, friend!

771
00:55:44,428 --> 00:55:46,097
¡Joey!

772
00:55:47,598 --> 00:55:49,392
What the hell is going on here?

773
00:55:49,517 --> 00:55:52,937
holy heaven, everyone in this city have bodyguards.

774
00:55:58,818 --> 00:56:00,820
Shit! I know you!

775
00:56:01,487 --> 00:56:04,907
Yeah, you're Suliński. I saw you out there.

776
00:56:05,032 --> 00:56:09,078
- You work for Big Tommy, right? - That's treasure. It is.

777
00:56:10,371 --> 00:56:13,207
Dammit! I do not want to get you, Suliński.

778
00:56:13,332 --> 00:56:16,210
Would you give me a beating. Yes?

779
00:56:16,711 --> 00:56:17,962
But I do not know this cretin.

780
00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:21,132
You're to discover who he is!

781
00:56:30,099 --> 00:56:33,019
- Things get complicated, right? - What do you want?

782
00:56:34,812 --> 00:56:36,147
Are you all right, Frenchy?

783
00:56:37,106 --> 00:56:38,232
You think?

784
00:56:38,357 --> 00:56:40,151
That I'm fine?

785
00:56:40,276 --> 00:56:42,570
This would be a good time to use jujitsu!

786
00:56:43,154 --> 00:56:44,238
Shit!

787
00:56:50,745 --> 00:56:52,204
Let's talk about Connor Mulligan

788
00:56:52,246 --> 00:56:54,749
and tell me where I can find the elf, right?

789
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:55,791
¿Connor Mulligan?

790
00:56:55,875 --> 00:56:57,084
- Is that what it is? - Yes.

791
00:56:57,251 --> 00:56:58,627
Are you kidding?

792
00:57:01,047 --> 00:57:04,091
Connor resigned a month ago. He went to Barbosa.

793
00:57:04,216 --> 00:57:06,969
But I must tell you, he's a good guy.

794
00:57:15,478 --> 00:57:19,065
As Big Tommy is sent you must be a lie.

795
00:57:19,815 --> 00:57:21,400
Heavens, you want to finish?

796
00:57:30,159 --> 00:57:31,827
Well, listen, listen.

797
00:57:31,952 --> 00:57:35,539
He ... He moved a club bartender.

798
00:57:35,873 --> 00:57:38,876
Tell Big Tommy is all I know, dammit!

799
00:57:39,335 --> 00:57:42,254
Stop doing that with the toothpick!

800
00:57:46,217 --> 00:57:47,217
Wait!

801
00:57:47,301 --> 00:57:50,096
Bite the pipe! Put your face in that pipe!

802
00:57:50,554 --> 00:57:54,058
In the next ten seconds I'll kick the fucking neck.

803
00:58:06,821 --> 00:58:08,447
What do you know? It's solved.

804
00:58:08,906 --> 00:58:11,867
Frog! Come here! You could use your boot!

805
00:58:12,243 --> 00:58:14,745
It's okay. I'll ask again.

806
00:58:15,287 --> 00:58:18,290
- Where can I find this Irish? - Wait, very good, very good!

807
00:58:18,416 --> 00:58:20,209
You answer the damn question, will you?

808
00:58:20,334 --> 00:58:24,755
The guy who lived, Tim. He knows where to find it!

809
00:58:24,964 --> 00:58:26,799
Your damn address

810
00:58:26,924 --> 00:58:30,011
It is on the payroll over the bar, okay?

811
00:58:30,928 --> 00:58:33,723
Was it so difficult?

812
00:58:33,848 --> 00:58:35,182
We're all fine. Good.

813
00:58:35,266 --> 00:58:36,308
Frenchie, are you okay?

814
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:39,729
Yes friend. I'm great, so I am.

815
00:58:40,104 --> 00:58:43,065
- Dammit. - Good. That's. We did it.

816
00:58:43,983 --> 00:58:45,151
Let's move on.

817
00:58:52,867 --> 00:58:53,909
Dammit.

818
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:59,999
I'm sick of 20 questions. You can handle this, okay?

819
00:59:00,124 --> 00:59:01,959
- Can I handle this, Sue? - Of course.

820
00:59:02,084 --> 00:59:04,795
Yes? It looks like I'm handling all friend.

821
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,215
Rather do 20 questions to have another terrible fight.

822
00:59:08,341 --> 00:59:10,676
Here you have. You can ask questions.

823
00:59:10,801 --> 00:59:11,801
Well thank you very much.

824
00:59:11,886 --> 00:59:14,055
It's 4:20 somewhere

825
00:59:15,598 --> 00:59:16,766
Who will?

826
00:59:19,602 --> 00:59:23,105
Hello Friend. I saw smoke coming out the window. Everything is alright?

827
00:59:23,606 --> 00:59:26,317
Smoke out much the kitchen window, my friend ...

828
00:59:29,445 --> 00:59:31,447
Okay, do you see? Do you see how I did it?

829
00:59:31,572 --> 00:59:35,826
Cute and easy. No tears, no blood. No one was hurt. All right.

830
00:59:35,951 --> 00:59:37,912
Who of you is the lucky Tim?

831
00:59:38,371 --> 00:59:41,248
- You can not go like that! - It's okay.

832
00:59:43,125 --> 00:59:47,755
- I'm going to crush your face! - Is the! He is Tim!

833
00:59:48,214 --> 00:59:50,299
- Is the. Tim? - It's not me. Please no!

834
00:59:50,466 --> 00:59:52,343
- True. We will deal with this. - Outside.

835
00:59:52,551 --> 00:59:54,679
- Come on, get out of here. - Sure, you do. Scram.

836
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,098
- Get up! - Get out of here!

837
00:59:57,181 --> 01:00:01,102
Wait! No, I tried to call them for more than a week, right?

838
01:00:01,185 --> 01:00:02,812
I swear to God, I have no drugs.

839
01:00:02,937 --> 01:00:06,482
I sold almost all the rest and smoked. I am sorry.

840
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:14,281
I am so sorry. Look at me, I'm pathetic!

841
01:00:14,573 --> 01:00:16,992
If they kill me, they would do me a favor. Agree?

842
01:00:17,368 --> 01:00:20,329
Look, I'll pay to Davey. Yes? I swear.

843
01:00:20,496 --> 01:00:22,415
Davey sent, right?

844
01:00:23,624 --> 01:00:24,624
¿Davey?

845
01:00:25,418 --> 01:00:26,418
¿No?

846
01:00:28,254 --> 01:00:30,047
Well, heavens!

847
01:00:30,381 --> 01:00:32,591
What do you want? Who made him angry now?

848
01:00:32,633 --> 01:00:34,343
We are looking for Connor Mulligan. You saw it?

849
01:00:34,427 --> 01:00:35,594
To who?

850
01:00:36,095 --> 01:00:39,223
Gosh, enough! He no longer lives here! It's okay?

851
01:00:39,432 --> 01:00:40,850
He no longer lives here!

852
01:00:42,268 --> 01:00:43,477
Dammit!

853
01:00:45,438 --> 01:00:47,732
Wait. Why seek to Connor?

854
01:00:47,773 --> 01:00:49,693
He's a good guy, he would not hurt a fly.

855
01:00:49,734 --> 01:00:52,945
Yes, everyone tells us that, what good is this guy thief.

856
01:00:52,987 --> 01:00:55,865
Do not! Connor is not a thief, friend. Look...

857
01:00:56,824 --> 01:00:59,535
Take, look. He is an honest man!

858
01:01:00,745 --> 01:01:01,746
¿Ves?

859
01:01:02,288 --> 01:01:03,664
I'll stick with this.

860
01:01:03,956 --> 01:01:06,542
Come on, no. That's the only photo he ...

861
01:01:06,667 --> 01:01:07,793
Wait a minute...

862
01:01:08,002 --> 01:01:10,546
That son of a bitch Barbosa sent you two?

863
01:01:10,838 --> 01:01:12,590
Connor Mulligan, where is he?

864
01:01:12,673 --> 01:01:14,800
No, Barbosa is the guy who needs a spanking!

865
01:01:14,925 --> 01:01:16,987
The bastard should have a slow and painful death.

866
01:01:17,011 --> 01:01:19,180
And you know what? That damn Amanda,

867
01:01:19,221 --> 01:01:21,057
she is the cause of all this.

868
01:01:21,098 --> 01:01:23,642
Very interesting, my friend, but I'll ask one last time.

869
01:01:23,726 --> 01:01:26,771
Otherwise, my man will break his head blows.

870
01:01:26,812 --> 01:01:28,606
Where is Connor Mulligan?

871
01:01:28,731 --> 01:01:29,940
Good good.

872
01:01:30,316 --> 01:01:32,568
He moved with a girl.

873
01:01:33,027 --> 01:01:37,031
In Topanga, you know? One of those communities of artists?

874
01:01:37,490 --> 01:01:39,450
A bunch of rich white hippies

875
01:01:39,658 --> 01:01:41,619
They are living trust fund in Cambodia.

876
01:01:41,869 --> 01:01:44,747
What a charmer. This Connor has a girl in every port.

877
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:47,375
No, not you, friend. He's a good guy.

878
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:50,336
Where is the honest Connor? Do you have an address?

879
01:01:50,461 --> 01:01:53,631
- An address ... - Come on, buddy! One direction!

880
01:01:53,714 --> 01:01:56,175
- Yes, yes, take it. - Do something!

881
01:01:56,801 --> 01:02:00,054
- Hurry up. - No, no ... Take that.

882
01:02:01,681 --> 01:02:03,307
Be fair, guys, okay?

883
01:02:03,349 --> 01:02:05,434
He deserves nothing of what you go for.

884
01:02:05,476 --> 01:02:09,188
Hey friend. I'd stay away from drugs if I were you.

885
01:02:09,271 --> 01:02:10,271
It's okay.

886
01:02:19,365 --> 01:02:21,992
I do not understand this to give you a number one this guy Connor.

887
01:02:22,243 --> 01:02:24,286
I think it's a prince.

888
01:02:25,204 --> 01:02:28,582
not for us to question it, I just find him and beat him.

889
01:02:28,708 --> 01:02:31,168
Yes, but how you can not question it?

890
01:02:31,210 --> 01:02:35,923
We are not maniacs out there looking for prey, right?

891
01:02:36,215 --> 01:02:40,094
Debts are supposed to charge not we give beatings at will.

892
01:02:41,303 --> 01:02:43,305
Remember those blurred lines?

893
01:02:43,431 --> 01:02:46,851
Today, we are goons. Yes?

894
01:02:47,059 --> 01:02:49,311
This job can be a roller coaster, Frenchy.

895
01:02:49,687 --> 01:02:51,772
By the way, you assume the lead in this.

896
01:02:51,856 --> 01:02:55,151
- As expected. - You can quit anytime.

897
01:02:55,276 --> 01:02:57,236
You are not right. I'm ready for that.

898
01:02:57,820 --> 01:02:58,820
Good.

899
01:02:59,030 --> 01:03:00,781
I like that because of the smoke. It was good.

900
01:03:00,865 --> 01:03:01,866
Yes? You liked, right?

901
01:03:01,991 --> 01:03:03,117
- If I liked. - Yes?

902
01:03:03,242 --> 01:03:05,036
But not leave you always get.

903
01:03:05,077 --> 01:03:07,079
Wait. Come on, friend. What do you suggest?

904
01:03:07,204 --> 01:03:10,166
Besides, of course, break the door down,

905
01:03:10,291 --> 01:03:11,876
What is the best way to go?

906
01:03:12,001 --> 01:03:14,545
Give it a blow to the head. Just one tap. Yes?

907
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:17,506
Just one tap. You do not want to crush his nose

908
01:03:17,631 --> 01:03:20,217
because you keep it for when you need it. True?

909
01:03:20,259 --> 01:03:22,511
True. As you did to that guy in Tim's house.

910
01:03:22,595 --> 01:03:24,013
Precisely.

911
01:03:24,388 --> 01:03:26,057
- Just one tap. - Just one tap.

912
01:03:26,182 --> 01:03:27,266
Cute and simple.

913
01:03:27,308 --> 01:03:29,977
A simple tap. Very good. I understood.

914
01:03:30,102 --> 01:03:31,020
Good.

915
01:03:31,062 --> 01:03:32,355
simple tap.

916
01:03:33,272 --> 01:03:34,273
Just one tap.

917
01:03:59,173 --> 01:04:00,174
It's here.

918
01:04:17,108 --> 01:04:19,568
Hello Friend. We are looking for Sandy.

919
01:04:20,403 --> 01:04:21,779
Who asks, doll?

920
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:27,576
Damn, it was a bit harsh.

921
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:31,497
Heavens, friend. Said a tap, not to kill him.

922
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:33,416
I tried to hit him, but it's not so simple.

923
01:04:33,457 --> 01:04:34,291
Good.

924
01:04:34,333 --> 01:04:36,460
I have much experience, let me see.

925
01:04:39,505 --> 01:04:41,590
- Who the hell are you? - Are you Sandy?

926
01:04:43,259 --> 01:04:47,138
Tell me where I can find Connor Mulligan!

927
01:04:47,304 --> 01:04:49,974
Hey, take it easy. She is small.

928
01:04:53,436 --> 01:04:55,396
I'm Sue, he is French.

929
01:04:56,522 --> 01:04:58,649
Can you please,

930
01:05:00,818 --> 01:05:02,570
tell us where Connor Mulligan?

931
01:05:03,279 --> 01:05:05,031
I will not say anything.

932
01:05:05,239 --> 01:05:07,533
If you two fucking arrogant, they are now going

933
01:05:07,658 --> 01:05:09,785
perhaps we not denounce.

934
01:05:11,912 --> 01:05:13,497
So get out of here.

935
01:05:19,337 --> 01:05:21,380
I do not know. Did I do something to offend you?

936
01:05:21,505 --> 01:05:23,883
Was I a little rough? What do you think, Frenchie?

937
01:05:24,175 --> 01:05:26,802
- Was I a little rough? - Take me to your Pit Bull off.

938
01:05:27,678 --> 01:05:29,263
Wait wait!

939
01:05:30,264 --> 01:05:31,891
You really gonna shock desmayarla?

940
01:05:31,932 --> 01:05:34,101
Do not touch me, neophyte, and let the professional work.

941
01:05:34,143 --> 01:05:35,019
Professional?

942
01:05:35,061 --> 01:05:37,396
Only weak men hit women!

943
01:05:37,438 --> 01:05:39,357
Already Shut up, Sandy! Agree? Shut up.

944
01:05:39,482 --> 01:05:43,194
Because I can not stop you from breaking your sharp tongue.

945
01:05:44,403 --> 01:05:46,739
It is not the time to be brave, okay?

946
01:05:47,031 --> 01:05:48,407
It's time to be sensible.

947
01:05:50,451 --> 01:05:51,786
Sanctus Heavens!

948
01:05:52,328 --> 01:05:54,330
You're not being sensible!

949
01:05:58,668 --> 01:06:01,504
Connor has a heart of gold.

950
01:06:02,463 --> 01:06:05,716
He picked me up when I was wrong and I settled here.

951
01:06:06,509 --> 01:06:09,095
He is kind, compassionate and caring.

952
01:06:09,136 --> 01:06:11,180
Something that you two would never understand.

953
01:06:11,389 --> 01:06:13,182
Although I knew something,

954
01:06:13,307 --> 01:06:15,601
I would not tell you a couple of cockroaches like you.

955
01:06:15,643 --> 01:06:16,936
Yes Yes Yes.

956
01:06:17,144 --> 01:06:19,814
Tell us all the wonderful little angel who is this guy,

957
01:06:19,939 --> 01:06:22,108
but we want to know is where he is.

958
01:06:22,692 --> 01:06:24,610
In the end of the rainbow iris perhaps?

959
01:06:24,735 --> 01:06:27,822
This whole nightmare began when she dug her claws.

960
01:06:28,155 --> 01:06:29,407
Who is she?

961
01:06:29,865 --> 01:06:31,867
Amanda Barbosa's fiancee.

962
01:06:31,992 --> 01:06:34,662
That snotty badgered Connor until he relented,

963
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:37,123
but that was not stupid enough to like her.

964
01:06:37,164 --> 01:06:39,542
She had to tell Barbosa to please her.

965
01:06:39,583 --> 01:06:41,544
Please, can you tell us where Connor?

966
01:06:42,128 --> 01:06:43,838
No, I will not say, Sue.

967
01:06:44,588 --> 01:06:46,340
I will not tell you anything.

968
01:06:49,844 --> 01:06:52,388
The first blow you give a woman, perhaps resist.

969
01:06:53,014 --> 01:06:54,598
But there is a coup ...

970
01:06:55,516 --> 01:06:57,226
breaking the bone ...

971
01:06:58,394 --> 01:07:01,272
and clear the cartilage through the muscle.

972
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:03,524
Lose leg permanently.

973
01:07:04,025 --> 01:07:07,570
Yes. Do this permanent damage usually it works.

974
01:07:09,697 --> 01:07:13,325
If anyone knows where he is, I bet it's that stupid.

975
01:07:13,659 --> 01:07:16,620
I bet my life that she is still trying to see him now.

976
01:07:32,345 --> 01:07:34,388
Do you disapprove? You wanted this job.

977
01:07:34,472 --> 01:07:36,724
- it is. Get used. - I did not say a word.

978
01:07:36,766 --> 01:07:40,186
The last two days had no trouble to burst everyone.

979
01:07:40,311 --> 01:07:42,563
- Yes, it was different, right? - I do not see how.

980
01:07:42,688 --> 01:07:44,315
Every guy I fought so far

981
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:47,193
He had tried to take off my head, right? I can handle that

982
01:07:47,276 --> 01:07:49,111
and I'm ready to deal with those idiots.

983
01:07:49,153 --> 01:07:52,365
But hitting a hippie to find out where your ex-boyfriend,

984
01:07:52,573 --> 01:07:55,534
no thanks friend. I do not care, fuck!

985
01:07:56,243 --> 01:07:57,411
Not interested.

986
01:07:57,453 --> 01:08:00,206
Guess what. You better find a new interest.

987
01:08:00,581 --> 01:08:02,958
Because this guy does not like to waste time.

988
01:08:03,084 --> 01:08:04,835
I think you do not understand me.

989
01:08:05,044 --> 01:08:08,214
We are in trouble if we do not find this idiot and give it to Barbosa.

990
01:08:08,422 --> 01:08:11,384
Forget all smiles, handshakes all.

991
01:08:11,550 --> 01:08:13,594
This Barbosa is a fucking demon.

992
01:08:16,639 --> 01:08:17,639
Fuck me.

993
01:08:17,723 --> 01:08:20,768
Yes, Barbosa could fuck you. If I were you, back to work.

994
01:08:20,935 --> 01:08:24,063
Started this job you wanted, you finish it.

995
01:08:25,564 --> 01:08:26,607
I will tell you something.

996
01:08:26,732 --> 01:08:28,609
We call it a day, go home, think again.

997
01:08:28,693 --> 01:08:30,861
Let me at home and pick me up in the morning, okay?

998
01:08:33,030 --> 01:08:34,448
You do not want to drive?

999
01:08:34,699 --> 01:08:36,742
You can not go with a hangover, right?

1000
01:08:36,826 --> 01:08:39,495
If you drink as much as I surf ever happens,

1001
01:08:39,537 --> 01:08:41,617
but I'll tell you something. If it's too much work for you ...

1002
01:08:41,747 --> 01:08:43,582
No, it's okay, buddy. You're right.

1003
01:08:44,083 --> 01:08:46,419
Anyway, I like it now.

1004
01:08:47,378 --> 01:08:49,171
It distracts me from all this shit.

1005
01:09:28,836 --> 01:09:29,920
Dammit.

1006
01:09:44,602 --> 01:09:46,520
SUNDAY

1007
01:09:50,066 --> 01:09:51,609
What do you think, Sue?

1008
01:09:51,859 --> 01:09:53,903
Do you think this girl is worth all this trouble?

1009
01:09:55,780 --> 01:09:57,865
I think it's a slut.

1010
01:09:58,824 --> 01:10:00,409
Yes, you must be right.

1011
01:10:02,328 --> 01:10:04,955
We have a shitty job here, do not you, friend?

1012
01:10:05,081 --> 01:10:07,917
Our job is to help the lunatic Barbosa

1013
01:10:07,958 --> 01:10:10,211
keep the shackles on the dregs of his fiancee.

1014
01:10:11,128 --> 01:10:14,840
Yes, it is a well paid job and did not think much if I were you.

1015
01:10:15,841 --> 01:10:18,636
A week ago, I would have done anything for this job,

1016
01:10:18,678 --> 01:10:20,388
but after the last two days ...

1017
01:10:22,932 --> 01:10:25,643
I do not know if you've been doing this so long it does not affect you.

1018
01:10:26,018 --> 01:10:27,728
It affects me, do not worry.

1019
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:32,358
Yes? I did just two days and I want to drink himself to death.

1020
01:10:34,944 --> 01:10:36,320
Why you drink, right?

1021
01:10:36,946 --> 01:10:40,324
Does drinking helps you numb the pain you caused shit?

1022
01:10:40,741 --> 01:10:43,119
I not think there's much alcohol in the world.

1023
01:10:44,286 --> 01:10:47,164
Do me a favor, do not judge me, okay? Die.

1024
01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:51,752
You think I do not care about the horrible things I did? I care.

1025
01:10:52,503 --> 01:10:56,924
It is one of the reasons why I drink myself to sleep every night.

1026
01:11:01,846 --> 01:11:03,556
What does your wife think of this?

1027
01:11:05,266 --> 01:11:07,852
I am not married. I was, but not anymore.

1028
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:09,937
Why do you keep using the alliance?

1029
01:11:10,855 --> 01:11:14,191
- As a reminder, I guess. - Of what?

1030
01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:18,404
Not get close to anyone again.

1031
01:11:20,573 --> 01:11:22,825
That seems to me a lonely life, friend.

1032
01:11:24,285 --> 01:11:25,953
Well, it's my life.

1033
01:11:26,245 --> 01:11:30,249
It sucks, it's ugly, but it's mine and I like it, yeah?

1034
01:11:32,251 --> 01:11:34,003
I have a sort of girlfriend.

1035
01:11:35,296 --> 01:11:37,214
She is a prostitute, works at the club

1036
01:11:37,256 --> 01:11:39,800
and I doubt he cares if I was on fire, but ...

1037
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:43,220
Frenchy, you know,

1038
01:11:43,512 --> 01:11:47,683
it is rare that certain people like people like us.

1039
01:11:47,767 --> 01:11:50,311
US? No friend. Do not.

1040
01:11:50,478 --> 01:11:53,814
- You, you mean. Yes? - Yeah, well, I accept.

1041
01:11:56,484 --> 01:11:58,444
What happened to your wife?

1042
01:12:01,822 --> 01:12:03,115
Usual.

1043
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:04,593
I'm sorry friend. I do not want to intrude.

1044
01:12:04,617 --> 01:12:06,869
No, it's not okay. We got married young.

1045
01:12:07,495 --> 01:12:10,539
It was almost finished when we lost Milly, our daughter.

1046
01:12:11,791 --> 01:12:13,793
Shit. I'm sorry I brought it up, buddy.

1047
01:12:13,918 --> 01:12:16,671
Do not regret it. he did not cause leukemia, right?

1048
01:12:18,005 --> 01:12:19,048
Yes.

1049
01:12:25,471 --> 01:12:28,391
She was six when she could no longer fight.

1050
01:12:28,641 --> 01:12:29,934
So...

1051
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:33,270
I do not know, after that, it was all over.

1052
01:12:33,354 --> 01:12:37,400
All that remained was the memory of losing the most beautiful ...

1053
01:12:38,150 --> 01:12:40,486
from the earth. Then yes.

1054
01:12:42,196 --> 01:12:45,616
So it seems I drink myself to sleep every night,

1055
01:12:45,658 --> 01:12:50,037
because if not, I only see the face of Milly and sorrows I caused.

1056
01:12:51,288 --> 01:12:52,915
So think about it, Frenchy.

1057
01:12:55,042 --> 01:12:57,044
Yes, you have to see all this.

1058
01:12:58,379 --> 01:13:00,423
Let's see if you spend today.

1059
01:13:07,722 --> 01:13:08,848
There she is.

1060
01:13:44,175 --> 01:13:46,093
She has a hard life, right?

1061
01:13:47,386 --> 01:13:50,431
Personally, I do not think there are enough shopping in the world

1062
01:13:50,556 --> 01:13:52,767
to compensate live with Barbosa, but ...

1063
01:13:53,684 --> 01:13:55,269
Yes, maybe you're right.

1064
01:14:04,820 --> 01:14:06,447
What's your story, Frenchy?

1065
01:14:08,699 --> 01:14:10,368
Who said you have one?

1066
01:14:11,535 --> 01:14:13,329
You're here, right?

1067
01:14:14,538 --> 01:14:16,123
I made some mistakes.

1068
01:14:16,832 --> 01:14:18,626
I joined the military.

1069
01:14:18,876 --> 01:14:20,461
I had the best intentions.

1070
01:14:22,129 --> 01:14:23,798
It did not work out.

1071
01:14:25,633 --> 01:14:27,677
I was not the only one who suffered for that either.

1072
01:14:29,345 --> 01:14:32,515
Collateral damage? My specialty.

1073
01:15:15,891 --> 01:15:17,977
This is not the Paseo del Rodeo, Frenchy.

1074
01:15:18,436 --> 01:15:20,187
What is she doing here?

1075
01:15:20,604 --> 01:15:23,315
I do not know, my friend. She does not seem very happy.

1076
01:15:23,691 --> 01:15:26,444
- Die! IRISH idiot! - This could be good.

1077
01:15:26,485 --> 01:15:29,405
Too good for you! damn fool.

1078
01:15:30,781 --> 01:15:34,160
Yes Yes! Too good for you! Do you know who the hell am I?

1079
01:15:34,285 --> 01:15:36,078
I'm the best you'll ever have, darling!

1080
01:15:36,454 --> 01:15:39,123
Die! I'm done with you anyway!

1081
01:15:45,713 --> 01:15:47,214
What the hell are you doing here?

1082
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:49,175
Making sure you're all right, Amanda.

1083
01:15:49,216 --> 01:15:51,635
- I'm fine. Now, get the hell out! - Come here, damn ...

1084
01:15:51,761 --> 01:15:53,220
Get your hands off me!

1085
01:15:53,304 --> 01:15:55,848
You know what will make you my promise if you learn?

1086
01:15:55,890 --> 01:15:59,352
Also tell you were outside the apartment Connor.

1087
01:15:59,393 --> 01:16:01,270
What? Did you talk to your ex stupid?

1088
01:16:01,395 --> 01:16:04,231
- Chinese aspiring artist? - You have nowhere to run, Amanda.

1089
01:16:04,357 --> 01:16:06,442
You should not have off the bus in this city!

1090
01:16:06,484 --> 01:16:08,110
I will tell you something. You have two options.

1091
01:16:08,152 --> 01:16:11,238
You can go back to that bus or you can marry Barbosa.

1092
01:16:11,447 --> 01:16:13,491
The boy Connor is not for you.

1093
01:16:13,908 --> 01:16:15,201
Second thought,

1094
01:16:15,409 --> 01:16:17,787
Maybe he has always been too good for you, right?

1095
01:16:17,828 --> 01:16:19,330
Scram, grandfather.

1096
01:16:19,538 --> 01:16:21,207
As if I need to take the bus!

1097
01:16:21,457 --> 01:16:23,125
Conduzco a Maserati.

1098
01:16:23,292 --> 01:16:25,753
I think you did not understand what the bus, dear.

1099
01:16:26,003 --> 01:16:28,130
Then, they found.

1100
01:16:28,422 --> 01:16:31,592
My fiance will enjoy their subordinates.

1101
01:16:31,759 --> 01:16:34,637
Apartment 610. Do what you can.

1102
01:16:35,304 --> 01:16:37,014
And Send her affection.

1103
01:16:44,814 --> 01:16:46,190
610.

1104
01:16:54,782 --> 01:16:56,534
- Pass, ma'am. - Thank you!

1105
01:16:56,575 --> 01:16:57,660
After you.

1106
01:16:57,702 --> 01:16:59,829
- Thank you dear. - It was a pleasure.

1107
01:17:08,421 --> 01:17:09,463
The elevator is here.

1108
01:17:09,588 --> 01:17:11,966
No, no elevators. No elevators use.

1109
01:17:12,091 --> 01:17:13,718
Come up the stairs.

1110
01:17:13,926 --> 01:17:16,429
- Are you sure you can handle it? - If I can.

1111
01:17:33,029 --> 01:17:34,697
Who are you?

1112
01:17:35,990 --> 01:17:39,035
Wait, wait, wait a minute! I know what you ...

1113
01:17:41,662 --> 01:17:44,290
Please wait! Wait a minute! I know what you want!

1114
01:17:44,331 --> 01:17:45,332
Stay here.

1115
01:17:45,374 --> 01:17:47,626
I know what you want. Listen, you can not be here.

1116
01:17:47,668 --> 01:17:49,587
You can not be here.

1117
01:17:49,628 --> 01:17:51,672
Please, for God's sake, let's go outside.

1118
01:17:51,714 --> 01:17:53,066
You know why we came, right, Connor?

1119
01:17:53,090 --> 01:17:56,135
Yes. Amanda burst intercom, right?

1120
01:17:57,428 --> 01:17:59,930
Hey honey. Come here. Everything is fine.

1121
01:18:00,056 --> 01:18:02,308
Dad's just you are playing with your friends, right?

1122
01:18:02,475 --> 01:18:04,369
Dear, do not panic. Do not panic, do not panic.

1123
01:18:04,393 --> 01:18:06,771
What happens? Who are these men, papi?

1124
01:18:06,812 --> 01:18:11,317
They are friends dad, okay? We're just chatting.

1125
01:18:11,359 --> 01:18:13,194
Lainie, honey, look at me. Look at Dad.

1126
01:18:13,235 --> 01:18:16,405
I want you back to your room to play. It's okay?

1127
01:18:16,655 --> 01:18:19,617
Okay, but ... Hey, honey?

1128
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:21,952
These are adult games, okay?

1129
01:18:22,203 --> 01:18:24,914
It's a fun, Lainie game. Do you want to play?

1130
01:18:25,081 --> 01:18:27,667
Come on. Everyone, kneeling, right?

1131
01:18:28,376 --> 01:18:31,462
I'll tell you how to play, Lainie. We all took hands.

1132
01:18:31,587 --> 01:18:34,674
And we closed our eyes, and someone is hiding.

1133
01:18:35,716 --> 01:18:37,093
Can you sit sh ...?

1134
01:18:37,718 --> 01:18:40,054
Can you sit down, please, Mr. French?

1135
01:18:41,263 --> 01:18:42,598
There is.

1136
01:18:42,807 --> 01:18:45,810
You know what? That means you get to hide, Lainie.

1137
01:18:45,976 --> 01:18:48,771
- How long do I have? - Let's count to 50,

1138
01:18:48,896 --> 01:18:50,731
then we're all going to get you, okay?

1139
01:18:50,773 --> 01:18:53,442
Find a good place to hide.

1140
01:18:53,693 --> 01:18:56,612
- Wait a minute. What is that? - What?

1141
01:18:57,571 --> 01:18:58,906
Here.

1142
01:19:00,199 --> 01:19:03,202
Whoops! Where did that come from?

1143
01:19:03,452 --> 01:19:06,956
It's magic, love. Yes? Now, go inside and hide.

1144
01:19:07,081 --> 01:19:09,125
It's magic, love. Go inside, take that.

1145
01:19:09,542 --> 01:19:12,336
Let's get you into a weirdo. So one ...

1146
01:19:12,545 --> 01:19:14,088
of ...

1147
01:19:14,213 --> 01:19:15,798
three...

1148
01:19:16,007 --> 01:19:17,258
four...

1149
01:19:18,009 --> 01:19:19,760
Let's get something clear.

1150
01:19:19,885 --> 01:19:21,804
You understand that you can not run forever?

1151
01:19:21,929 --> 01:19:23,222
I'm not running away.

1152
01:19:23,347 --> 01:19:26,100
Just I am trying to get on with my life. With my daughter.

1153
01:19:26,434 --> 01:19:27,601
And where is his mother?

1154
01:19:27,727 --> 01:19:29,520
- She died. - How touching.

1155
01:19:29,645 --> 01:19:31,313
How did you get into this mess?

1156
01:19:31,439 --> 01:19:33,566
How a guy like Barbosa is hunting you?

1157
01:19:33,733 --> 01:19:35,818
I managed a few clubs in Dublin

1158
01:19:35,943 --> 01:19:39,363
and when I got here, I got a job at a club Barbosa.

1159
01:19:40,489 --> 01:19:43,826
- I came with ideas, friend! I ... - Come on, tell me more, what?

1160
01:19:43,909 --> 01:19:45,453
To sum up,

1161
01:19:46,287 --> 01:19:48,914
I fell in love with one of the dancers Barbosa.

1162
01:19:49,498 --> 01:19:50,583
Crystal.

1163
01:19:50,791 --> 01:19:52,209
She was perfect friend.

1164
01:19:53,669 --> 01:19:55,546
It was perfect for me, at least.

1165
01:19:55,838 --> 01:19:58,466
But the problem was that Barbosa, he's a ...

1166
01:19:58,591 --> 01:20:00,343
is a possessive idiot, right?

1167
01:20:00,801 --> 01:20:03,679
He hated that she was in love with me instead of him.

1168
01:20:03,888 --> 01:20:05,514
Crystal was pregnant

1169
01:20:05,931 --> 01:20:09,185
and when he discovered it, he gave him a terrible beating.

1170
01:20:09,977 --> 01:20:13,814
Even he stabbed! Yes. Can you believe it?

1171
01:20:14,273 --> 01:20:17,193
Damn snake stabbed a pregnant girl.

1172
01:20:17,610 --> 01:20:22,198
Lainie, she was born very prematurely. She was in the ICU long.

1173
01:20:24,325 --> 01:20:28,371
Crystal ... She never left the hospital.

1174
01:20:29,205 --> 01:20:32,750
- She died shortly after birth. - Where does Amanda in all this?

1175
01:20:32,875 --> 01:20:38,506
She wanted a bite of the forbidden fruit, I guess. I dont know.

1176
01:20:39,090 --> 01:20:44,261
She is the one who told him to Barbosa and that caused his psychotic rage ...

1177
01:20:44,303 --> 01:20:45,763
and here we are.

1178
01:20:46,430 --> 01:20:48,349
Listen to me, listen to me,

1179
01:20:48,599 --> 01:20:49,809
I beg you,

1180
01:20:49,934 --> 01:20:52,895
I beg you, please. For the sake of my daughter.

1181
01:20:56,857 --> 01:20:58,192
Sue...

1182
01:21:00,444 --> 01:21:02,655
- Very good. Listen to me, okay? - Yes.

1183
01:21:02,905 --> 01:21:04,657
You'll leave the city, right?

1184
01:21:04,782 --> 01:21:07,326
Never again you will tread Los Angeles? You understand me?

1185
01:21:07,535 --> 01:21:08,577
- I swear. - Yes?

1186
01:21:08,703 --> 01:21:09,912
Wait. I go slowly here.

1187
01:21:09,995 --> 01:21:12,206
You're in no position to make that decision.

1188
01:21:12,289 --> 01:21:14,125
Agree? Do not do that!

1189
01:21:14,166 --> 01:21:16,395
- Sue, if what he says is true ... - You have no authority!

1190
01:21:16,419 --> 01:21:18,087
If what he says it is true

1191
01:21:18,212 --> 01:21:21,966
and yield to Barbosa, we are terrible stupid,

1192
01:21:22,174 --> 01:21:23,676
it is not true?

1193
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:26,345
And the girl?

1194
01:21:33,853 --> 01:21:35,771
If we let you go,

1195
01:21:36,647 --> 01:21:38,607
you go now.

1196
01:21:39,025 --> 01:21:43,070
- Thank you! Thank you. I get it. - Do not thank us.

1197
01:21:43,195 --> 01:21:47,116
We are ruined to let you go. Save your daughter, right?

1198
01:21:47,324 --> 01:21:48,409
Agree.

1199
01:21:54,373 --> 01:21:59,337
Get out of where you are, Sal! You can not be far.

1200
01:22:03,341 --> 01:22:05,885
You walk by a line you should never cross.

1201
01:22:06,927 --> 01:22:10,723
It is the line between being respectable, serious,

1202
01:22:11,682 --> 01:22:13,934
and be a complete son of a bitch amoral

1203
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:15,519
and if you soften it,

1204
01:22:16,062 --> 01:22:17,229
it's over.

1205
01:22:20,066 --> 01:22:23,235
It was what had to be done, Sue. You know that, right?

1206
01:22:23,861 --> 01:22:26,197
¡Muérete, franchute!
¡Muérete!

1207
01:22:26,655 --> 01:22:29,200
What do you think when you discover Tommy?

1208
01:22:31,952 --> 01:22:33,913
Amanda saw us in.

1209
01:22:34,497 --> 01:22:36,999
She'll give us away. Die!

1210
01:22:38,209 --> 01:22:40,461
At least I can live with myself.

1211
01:22:40,670 --> 01:22:43,547
Maybe not for long, silly bastard.

1212
01:22:43,839 --> 01:22:46,759
I should my head examined for listening!

1213
01:22:50,012 --> 01:22:51,514
It could be good, right?

1214
01:22:51,639 --> 01:22:54,558
For once, to look in the mirror and not feel nauseated.

1215
01:23:01,399 --> 01:23:03,859
She was the same age of Milly. You know, Frenchy?

1216
01:23:04,318 --> 01:23:05,945
I could not.

1217
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:09,824
I could not. I could not let her see us beating his dad.

1218
01:23:10,533 --> 01:23:12,451
I just could not.

1219
01:23:21,877 --> 01:23:24,964
What are you doing here, Amanda? You should go home!

1220
01:23:25,172 --> 01:23:26,966
What are they doing? Where is Connor?

1221
01:23:27,049 --> 01:23:28,009
He was not there.

1222
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:29,593
Of course it was! I talked to him.

1223
01:23:29,719 --> 01:23:31,429
No, not you speak. It was not his voice.

1224
01:23:31,470 --> 01:23:34,765
I recognize his Irish accent when I hear it.

1225
01:23:35,057 --> 01:23:36,892
In addition, none of that matters.

1226
01:23:37,018 --> 01:23:40,521
Barbosa is here. They set a trap, morons.

1227
01:23:40,688 --> 01:23:43,024
They came to kill Connor and blame you two.

1228
01:23:43,566 --> 01:23:47,361
- They already went up the elevator. - And you're happy about that, right?

1229
01:23:47,570 --> 01:23:49,238
Damn bitch.

1230
01:23:50,364 --> 01:23:52,408
Have we got a set for this?

1231
01:23:52,992 --> 01:23:56,871
She set us up for this! Damn bitch!

1232
01:24:05,838 --> 01:24:07,381
I can not believe it.

1233
01:24:09,175 --> 01:24:10,885
What do you think we should do, Sue?

1234
01:24:11,052 --> 01:24:14,638
I do not know, beginner. I never went through this until you came.

1235
01:24:15,681 --> 01:24:18,351
We could call Tommy, gather the boys.

1236
01:24:18,642 --> 01:24:23,314
Let them know what plot Barbosa and obliterate their offspring.

1237
01:24:23,564 --> 01:24:24,564
Yes?

1238
01:24:25,691 --> 01:24:27,151
And the boy?

1239
01:24:52,009 --> 01:24:53,636
They have guns, Frenchy.

1240
01:24:54,261 --> 01:24:55,554
They have weapons.

1241
01:24:56,013 --> 01:24:58,432
No no no. We can with them.

1242
01:24:58,641 --> 01:25:00,059
We can with them.

1243
01:25:00,351 --> 01:25:01,936
We hit them hard, fast. True?

1244
01:25:02,061 --> 01:25:03,062
I took the gun,

1245
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:05,690
I shot a few shots the rest, they get scared.

1246
01:25:05,856 --> 01:25:08,776
We have to go find Connor and the girl. Then we go.

1247
01:25:08,984 --> 01:25:10,361
We can do it, buddy.

1248
01:25:13,572 --> 01:25:15,032
- Well, of course. - Yes?

1249
01:25:15,282 --> 01:25:16,909
Come on. We can.

1250
01:25:43,936 --> 01:25:47,273
Hey, Sue. We work well together this weekend, my friend.

1251
01:25:47,398 --> 01:25:49,316
But I do not think you come to work on Monday.

1252
01:25:49,567 --> 01:25:53,112
This is by far the worst job you've ever had in my fucking life.

1253
01:25:55,823 --> 01:25:58,743
I wish I'd had your wisdom 20 years ago, boy.

1254
01:25:59,243 --> 01:26:00,619
Come on?

1255
01:26:20,890 --> 01:26:21,890
¿Alex?

1256
01:26:21,974 --> 01:26:25,686
French, I warned you. It is a ruthless business.

1257
01:26:35,029 --> 01:26:36,072
And.

1258
01:26:50,628 --> 01:26:52,713
Connor, open the door now!

1259
01:26:54,256 --> 01:26:55,841
- Get in there! - Fast fast fast!

1260
01:26:55,966 --> 01:26:57,760
Lainie, come here! Come here.

1261
01:27:00,221 --> 01:27:01,639
Is there another way out of here?

1262
01:27:01,764 --> 01:27:04,034
Over there. The fire escape across the room Lainie.

1263
01:27:04,058 --> 01:27:05,535
It will take the stairs to the lobby.

1264
01:27:05,559 --> 01:27:08,020
You go down. Take it to her and see now. Go.

1265
01:27:11,315 --> 01:27:14,193
Sue, cover yourself with something!

1266
01:28:18,883 --> 01:28:20,092
Dammit.

1267
01:29:09,058 --> 01:29:14,105
Sue, you're not half the man that Tommy thought you were.

1268
01:29:15,731 --> 01:29:17,191
Look at that, friend.

1269
01:29:18,234 --> 01:29:20,194
You had've been gone.

1270
01:29:21,195 --> 01:29:23,614
Sorry formed with a knockout,

1271
01:29:23,948 --> 01:29:25,116
Golden Boy.

1272
01:29:35,835 --> 01:29:36,877
Tommy.

1273
01:29:37,461 --> 01:29:39,797
Your boys, friend. They began.

1274
01:29:40,047 --> 01:29:42,508
It was a bloodbath. I tried to stop them.

1275
01:29:42,925 --> 01:29:44,593
That's why I called you.

1276
01:29:45,261 --> 01:29:47,430
- My guys did this? - Yes.

1277
01:29:47,638 --> 01:29:49,223
As always says Sue,

1278
01:29:49,390 --> 01:29:53,561
There will always be a bigger and meaner cat waiting defeat.

1279
01:29:54,645 --> 01:29:55,980
Tommy...

1280
01:29:56,605 --> 01:29:58,357
we have a history.

1281
01:29:59,233 --> 01:30:00,401
Trash,

1282
01:30:01,110 --> 01:30:03,320
Do you think I know that You stretched a trap?

1283
01:30:04,113 --> 01:30:05,990
What really believed would kill a man

1284
01:30:06,073 --> 01:30:09,076
as Golden Boy Suliński Baker and you away with it?

1285
01:30:12,538 --> 01:30:15,750
Not after all these years, he was good to me.

1286
01:30:33,351 --> 01:30:34,560
Above.

1287
01:30:34,935 --> 01:30:36,855
- Your! Put a SWAT on the radio! - Yes sir!

1288
01:30:36,937 --> 01:30:38,522
You two, when I say!

1289
01:30:38,647 --> 01:30:42,151
I need SWAT in Eastside, 5610. Full equipment. Over and out.

1290
01:31:38,582 --> 01:31:39,792
Here they are!

1291
01:31:39,917 --> 01:31:41,711
- Thank you very much. Thank you. - You're welcome!

1292
01:31:41,836 --> 01:31:43,716
- This looks lovely. - Here you go, honey.

1293
01:31:43,921 --> 01:31:46,632
- Can I serve you something else? - No that's all. Thank you.

1294
01:31:46,799 --> 01:31:48,718
You let me cut it for you, okay?

1295
01:31:49,301 --> 01:31:51,595
You must not atragantarte after all.

1296
01:31:51,721 --> 01:31:55,224
Hey, eat spinach. It's delicious, right?

1297
01:31:57,268 --> 01:32:01,772
Do cows have a good life before becoming steak, papi?

1298
01:32:01,897 --> 01:32:06,068
Yes Yes Yes. Of course, dear. Yes.

1299
01:32:06,277 --> 01:32:11,365
Cows do fun things they love to do. You know? As...

1300
01:32:11,615 --> 01:32:16,746
Like eating daisies, wallowing in the grass. Like you.

1301
01:32:16,871 --> 01:32:18,831
Then, you know, he reaches the farmer.

1302
01:32:19,373 --> 01:32:21,834
He looks at the cow in the eye and says:

1303
01:32:22,501 --> 01:32:24,587
Time roast!

1304
01:32:29,383 --> 01:32:31,594
I'm glad they have fun, Daddy.

1305
01:32:31,844 --> 01:32:35,014
Yeah, me too, dear. Me too.

1306
01:32:41,771 --> 01:32:43,439
As dinner.
