A startling verdict
in what many are calling

4
00:00:43,232 --> 00:00:46,273
the most controversial
murder trial in years.

5
00:00:46,275 --> 00:00:49,525
Anthony Tucker found guilty
of first degree murder.

My client maintains
his innocence.

do that to your wife?

Anthony Tucker, I am
honored to formally invite you

10
00:01:15,982 --> 00:01:18,480
to participate as a
contestant on this year's

00:01:18,482 --> 00:01:20,313
Jurassic Games.

12
00:01:20,315 --> 00:01:21,482
Do you accept?

Yes.

I don't even care
about the contestants,

17
00:01:41,025 --> 00:01:43,771
I wanna see the hot host and
what he's gonna be wearing

18
00:01:43,773 --> 00:01:46,313
and saying, that's
what I wanna watch.

The sand on your skin.

27
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:34,648
The sun on your face,
the taste in your mouth.

28
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,023
Well to all of you this
world is absolutely real.

29
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:41,688
The danger is real
and the pain is real.

But so is the reward.

31

Oh, oh, be careful with that.

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,150
I'll need you to do
as I say or boom.

34

You all know that
when you die in here,

00:02:57,065 --> 00:02:58,482
you die for real.

36
00:02:59,732 --> 00:03:02,273
All of you are in
here for one reason.

37
00:03:02,275 --> 00:03:03,940
To win your freedom.

38
00:03:04,857 --> 00:03:05,775
To go home.

39
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,355
You can avoid the death you
justly deserve by surviving,

40
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,438
by fighting, by
confronting your fears

41
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,775
and proving your worthiness.

42
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,605
Your goal is to be
the sole survivor.

43
00:03:19,607 --> 00:03:21,730
Find yourself the last
man or woman standing

44
00:03:21,732 --> 00:03:23,938
and you will win a full
pardon, you will go home,

45
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,940
free, alive, exonerated.

46
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,105
Now it will be tempting
to kill each other,

47
00:03:31,107 --> 00:03:32,398
there's no rules against that,

48
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,605
but please if you
would be so kind,

49
00:03:34,607 --> 00:03:36,605
try to leave at least
some of you alive

your first objective awaits.

55

A temporary safe zone.

Now your collars will
alert you when you arrive.

Red, you're too far
away, yellow means

58
00:03:53,649 --> 00:03:56,147
you're getting closer, and
green means you have reached

59
00:03:56,149 --> 00:04:00,150
the safe zone and completed
your first challenge.

60
00:04:01,483 --> 00:04:04,813
Reach the safe zone in
one hour or you die.

Die here in the
game and as you know

62

you will die in real
life by lethal injection

being hunted by hungry dinosaurs

temporary safe zone.

A deadly labyrinth filled with
some of our fan favorites.

gonna give that away, do you?

Do you know where
the safe zone is?

171
00:10:21,066 --> 00:10:21,900
I'm lost.

What?

180
00:11:58,816 --> 00:12:01,650
You're kind of a
pussy, aren't you?

181
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,730
I'm not here to kill anybody.

182
00:12:08,732 --> 00:12:10,814
I'm here to kill everybody.

183
00:12:10,816 --> 00:12:11,983
Well, not you.

184
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:14,107
Not yet.

185
00:12:15,857 --> 00:12:16,732
Lighten up.

186
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:25,691
Come on, I think the safe
zone's this way and I'm scared.

[tense music]

192
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,900
Live in three, two.

193
00:12:56,816 --> 00:12:58,064
Thank you.

194
00:12:58,066 --> 00:12:59,648
I'm here with Bailey
and Andrew Tucker.

195
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:02,064
Thank you for taking the
time to meet with me.

196
00:13:02,066 --> 00:13:04,189
Bailey, let's start
with you, sweetheart.

197
00:13:04,191 --> 00:13:05,439
How do you feel
about your father

198
00:13:05,441 --> 00:13:08,898
being a contestant on
the Jurassic Games?

199
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,732
Um, this was his only
chance to get out, so.

200
00:13:14,025 --> 00:13:15,398
That's right.

201
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,898
If he wins, he will be
pardoned of all of his crimes.

202
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,564
He didn't commit any crimes.

203
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:21,064
And he didn't kill my mom!

204
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:23,439
Andrew stop, we're not
supposed to talk about it.

205
00:13:23,441 --> 00:13:25,023
It's alright.

206
00:13:25,025 --> 00:13:28,148
Your mother's death was tragic.

207
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,439
I'm very sorry she can't
be with you here today.

208
00:13:30,441 --> 00:13:32,105
Thank you.

209
00:13:32,107 --> 00:13:34,439
Is there anything you'd
like to say to your father?

210
00:13:34,441 --> 00:13:35,480
Look into this camera.

211
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,732
You can send him a message.

212
00:13:38,982 --> 00:13:40,940
Survive, Dad, please.

213
00:13:42,275 --> 00:13:43,523
We know you're innocent.

214
00:13:43,525 --> 00:13:44,605
Get him out of the games!

215
00:13:44,607 --> 00:13:46,440
- Stop the games!
- Andy.

216

No more games!

225
00:13:59,482 --> 00:14:00,939
I can't believe they
made me talk to his kids.

226
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:02,773
They think he's innocent.

227
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:05,023
What difference does it make?

228
00:14:05,025 --> 00:14:07,230
Well, what if
they found proof?

229
00:14:07,232 --> 00:14:08,730
You think they'd let him go?

230
00:14:08,732 --> 00:14:10,605
If they find proof,
we'll never hear about it.

231
00:14:10,607 --> 00:14:11,605
Trust me.

232
00:14:11,607 --> 00:14:12,605
Let's go!

233
00:14:12,607 --> 00:14:13,982
Move, move, move!

234
00:14:22,107 --> 00:14:23,314
So how close are they?

235
00:14:23,316 --> 00:14:24,398
The audience is
getting restless.

236
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,980
A few minutes most,
but they're good hunters.

237
00:14:25,982 --> 00:14:27,230
I thought we could
build tension.

238
00:14:27,232 --> 00:14:28,480
Build tension?

239
00:14:28,482 --> 00:14:30,898
Our viewers don't care
about tension, Brian.

240
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,773
They just wanna see the
contestants die horribly.

241
00:14:33,775 --> 00:14:36,107
Spawn them closer next time.

242
00:14:39,607 --> 00:14:41,314
And stay on Tucker.

243
00:14:41,316 --> 00:14:43,480
The audience already is
sympathetic with him.

244
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,773
Let's watch him die live.

245
00:14:45,775 --> 00:14:46,857
You got it.

246
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,480
So your wife.

247
00:15:01,482 --> 00:15:03,523
She was tortured.

248
00:15:03,525 --> 00:15:05,355
Leave it alone.

249
00:15:05,357 --> 00:15:08,980
I wonder what she was
thinking when she died.

250
00:15:08,982 --> 00:15:11,523
Some people can
just turn it off.

251
00:15:11,525 --> 00:15:12,357
The pain.

252
00:15:13,482 --> 00:15:15,525
I've always admired that.

253
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,939
I read your cast bio.

254
00:15:19,941 --> 00:15:21,858
Loving daddy, good man.

255
00:15:23,066 --> 00:15:26,648
It's clear why the world
thinks you're innocent.

256
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:30,566
If it makes you feel any
better, I believe you.

257
00:15:31,816 --> 00:15:32,650
Goodie.

258
00:15:33,525 --> 00:15:35,691
[kicking]

259
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:41,814
Get up!

[struggling]

262
00:16:27,107 --> 00:16:29,690
I'll see you in the next round.

00:16:37,441 --> 00:16:38,523
[laughing]

264
00:16:38,525 --> 00:16:40,647
Go you little bitch.

265
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:41,938
Hey, you know what?

266
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,563
Can we get some wind,
just to make him sway

267
00:16:43,565 --> 00:16:45,438
a little bit?

268
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,065
Roll her package.

269
00:16:49,024 --> 00:16:50,272
Bloodthirsty.

270
00:16:50,274 --> 00:16:51,647
Merciless.

271
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:53,147
Psychopath.

272
00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:56,647
Words used to describe
Sarah Laforte.

273
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:57,981
The youngest death row inmate

274
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:00,231
to ever enter the
Jurassic Games.

275
00:17:00,233 --> 00:17:02,356
I had the opportunity
to sit down with her

276
00:17:02,358 --> 00:17:07,275
and try to get inside the head
of this cold-blooded killer.

277
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,775
Sarah?

278
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,690
I just want to ask
you a few questions.

279
00:17:32,065 --> 00:17:32,900
Joy.

280
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,858
My friends call me Joy.

281
00:17:38,025 --> 00:17:40,688
Why do you prefer
to be called Joy?

282
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:43,525
Because I'm such
a happy person.

283
00:17:44,525 --> 00:17:45,400
Okay Joy.

284
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,688
What happened in your
life that brought you here

285
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,357
at such a young age?

286
00:17:53,108 --> 00:17:54,441
It's a secret.

287
00:18:00,858 --> 00:18:03,108

289
00:18:12,315 --> 00:18:13,900
Any more questions?

[beeping]

291
00:18:21,065 --> 00:18:22,815
Ah, well well well.

You are still hanging
in there, aren't ya?

293
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,400
Oh come on man, come on!

294
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,731
What do you got inside ya, huh?

295
00:18:32,733 --> 00:18:33,898
Are you gonna let
this little girl

296
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,648
take you out of the
game this early?

297
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,231
What about your kids?

298
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:38,688
You can't die now.

299
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:39,525
Jesus.

[speaking foreign language]

301
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:13,608
We must work together
as long as we can.

302
00:19:18,733 --> 00:19:23,148
There are things more
terrible than us in this game.

303
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:27,150
As individuals, we
don't stand a chance!

304
00:19:29,275 --> 00:19:31,813
There may still
be a way to escape

305
00:19:31,815 --> 00:19:33,482
if we work together.

306
00:19:34,565 --> 00:19:36,273
We must get to the safe zone.

307
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:37,940
We are being hunted.

308
00:19:43,525 --> 00:19:44,856
There are three of them.

309
00:19:44,858 --> 00:19:46,191
We must go, now!

[Savannah] You're not
planning on using that, are you?

313
00:20:20,983 --> 00:20:22,231
No.

314
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:24,691
We wouldn't want an uprising.

315
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,023
It almost sounds like you do.

316
00:20:29,025 --> 00:20:30,731
His children, Savannah?

317
00:20:30,733 --> 00:20:33,023
You made me interview
Tucker's children?

318
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:34,273
Well he's trending high.

319
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:35,813
People want him to win.

320
00:20:35,815 --> 00:20:37,898
It's been a while since we had
one that might be innocent.

321
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,856
His children
believe that he is,

322
00:20:39,858 --> 00:20:40,856
and they're about to see him

323
00:20:40,858 --> 00:20:43,688
get ripped to shreds on live TV.

324
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:46,231
Nobody's forcing
you to be here.

325
00:20:46,233 --> 00:20:49,148
There are a number of
people behind you that would

326
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,813
love your job.

327
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,815
Younger, smarter, prettier.

328
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,398
They would put their
first born in the game

329
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,563
to get a shot at your position.

330
00:20:57,565 --> 00:20:58,400
I know.

331
00:20:59,275 --> 00:21:00,731
I want to be here.

332
00:21:00,733 --> 00:21:01,566
Good.

333
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:06,856
Oh.

334
00:21:06,858 --> 00:21:09,563
If you ever question

Oh he should be easy.

339
00:21:47,025 --> 00:21:48,481
You want him?

340
00:21:48,483 --> 00:21:49,316
Wait.

341
00:21:52,608 --> 00:21:53,900
Don't be stupid.

342
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,233
Hi friend.

343
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:01,313
Do you happen to know which
way it is to the safe zone?

344
00:22:01,315 --> 00:22:04,563
We don't have much
time to find it.

345
00:22:04,565 --> 00:22:06,650
No, I have no idea.

00:22:07,983 --> 00:22:09,108
We're lost.

347
00:22:10,233 --> 00:22:13,563
We could die on the
first challenge.

348
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:15,606
Wrong answer, pal!

Wait, stop!

350

The raptors have
entered the canyon area.

What?

352
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,188
No, no no no.

353
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:25,023
How long until they get to them?

354
00:22:25,025 --> 00:22:26,483
Any second now.

355
00:22:27,483 --> 00:22:30,188
Do you know who I am?

356
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:34,275
I am El Avispa, The Wasp!

I'm The Wasp!

360
00:22:43,275 --> 00:22:44,856
I got a big stinger on my butt

361
00:22:44,858 --> 00:22:48,606
and when I sting
you I'm gonna die.

362
00:22:48,608 --> 00:22:49,688
I think that's a bee, man.

363
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:50,525
Shut up!

364
00:22:53,525 --> 00:22:55,398
I have very powerful friends.

Help me get to the
end, help me win.

368
00:23:03,108 --> 00:23:05,563
Why would we do that?

369
00:23:05,565 --> 00:23:08,356
Because I can
save your mother.

370
00:23:08,358 --> 00:23:10,563
What do you know
about my mama, huh?

371
00:23:10,565 --> 00:23:12,773
I know all about you.

372

Trust me.

373
00:23:14,608 --> 00:23:16,688
I can get us all out of here.

374
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:19,688
You will be able to
see your mother again.

What is happening in here?

389
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,023
Our ratings have dipped 4%.

390
00:24:06,025 --> 00:24:07,563
Why did you stop the raptors?

391

Listen, it's called
foreplay, Savannah.

You might wanna try it sometime.

[Woman] Alright we're back
in five, four, three, two.

That just happened.

395
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,481
Could this be an unholy alliance

396
00:24:22,483 --> 00:24:25,523
between the Mason
brothers and The Wasp?

And ladies and gentlemen,
I would hate to see

400
00:24:31,315 --> 00:24:35,148
what that means for
our other contestants.

401
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:38,231
Let's head back to the canyon.

I can save your

Come on.

You really think he's gonna
save anybody else but himself?

How stupid could you be?

412
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:04,481
She's dying of cancer, no?

413
00:25:04,483 --> 00:25:06,983
No one dies of cancer anymore.

Haven't you seen
this show before?

If he wins, we die, you idiot!

No he said he could
get us out too, huh?

Si.

If there's even a chance
that we can save Mom.

This is all bullshit!

426

If he knows anyone outside,
then what's he doing

427

in here in the first place?

tiny little brain.

I'll kill you myself.

But I promise that you are
gonna see the raptors soon

00:26:50,565 --> 00:26:53,481
That was a good
transition, right?

448
00:26:53,483 --> 00:26:54,688
That was good.

Nice work.

angle was a little forced

00:27:00,733 --> 00:27:03,231
but it was good drama.

Well, alright.

make sure we keep them alive

00:30:31,733 --> 00:30:33,023
Eh, nothing new.

505
00:30:33,025 --> 00:30:34,523
They've been
protesting for years.

506
00:30:34,525 --> 00:30:35,648
Yeah.

507
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:36,856
We should put some of
those Cavemen in the games.

508
00:30:36,858 --> 00:30:38,106
Yeah no shit.

509
00:30:38,108 --> 00:30:39,273
Come on.

510
00:30:39,275 --> 00:30:40,813
We're starting the maze.

511
00:30:40,815 --> 00:30:44,523
[Crowd] No more games, no
more games, no more games!

512
00:30:44,525 --> 00:30:47,525
[suspenseful music]

513
00:30:55,983 --> 00:30:57,938
Only eight remain.

514
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,023
What a cast though, huh?

515
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,608
The Mason brothers.

516
00:31:02,815 --> 00:31:04,938
Would you take out
one of your own

517
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,400
if it really came down to it?

518
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:09,731
We'll see.

519
00:31:09,733 --> 00:31:10,650
We got Joy.

520
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,440
Ah, Joy, Joy, Joy.

521
00:31:14,608 --> 00:31:16,231
I'm telling you, there
is something special

522
00:31:16,233 --> 00:31:18,813
about sweet little Joy.

523
00:31:18,815 --> 00:31:21,356
Then we got Albert,
the cannibal.

524
00:31:21,358 --> 00:31:24,441
Albert, you make me sick.

525
00:31:25,233 --> 00:31:27,563
In a good way, of course,
because people tune in

526
00:31:27,565 --> 00:31:29,481
just to see you die.

527
00:31:29,483 --> 00:31:31,481
[laughs]

528
00:31:31,483 --> 00:31:32,400
I like you.

529
00:31:33,565 --> 00:31:37,063
Keep you around for our
international viewers.

530
00:31:37,065 --> 00:31:40,563
And then we have
poor Anthony Tucker.

531
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:43,438
Doesn't really seem like
he's cut out for this,

532
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,313
but you know what, America
loves a tragic hero so I do too.

533
00:31:47,315 --> 00:31:49,606
Hang in there, buddy.

534
00:31:49,608 --> 00:31:50,441
Stephanie.

535
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:52,775
Oh Stephanie.

536
00:31:54,108 --> 00:31:57,813
I'd really hate for
someone or something

537
00:31:57,815 --> 00:32:00,481
to ruin that pretty face.

538
00:32:00,483 --> 00:32:02,773
Guess we'll have
to wait for that.

539
00:32:02,775 --> 00:32:04,775
And El Avispa, The Wasp.

540
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,188
I like you.

541
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,440
You're naughty.

542
00:32:10,065 --> 00:32:12,940
Alright, wake 'em
up, I wanna play.

543
00:32:30,483 --> 00:32:32,148
Welcome, contestants.

544
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,398
I hope you are ready for
your first challenge.

545
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,773
We like to call it the maze.

546
00:32:36,775 --> 00:32:38,063
A favorite segment of the games

547
00:32:38,065 --> 00:32:40,313
and our longest-running
challenge.

548
00:32:40,315 --> 00:32:41,856
The rules are simple.

549
00:32:41,858 --> 00:32:43,188
Be the first to
escape your chains

550
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:45,650
and you will be awarded this.

551
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:50,525
Right?

552
00:32:51,483 --> 00:32:52,981
Use it to protect yourself,

553
00:32:52,983 --> 00:32:54,981
use it to obliterate
your enemies.

554
00:32:54,983 --> 00:32:57,023
The choice is yours.

555
00:32:57,025 --> 00:32:58,938
I think in the right hands,
the hands of a fighter,

556
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,398
the hands of a winner,
this fine piece of hardware

557
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,313
could wind up ending
the game early.

558
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,856
Anything can happen
in the Jurassic Games.

559
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:08,106
That's what makes
it so much fun!

560
00:33:08,108 --> 00:33:09,313
So here we go!

561

I got it!

You're all dead!

566
00:33:52,483 --> 00:33:53,771
I win!

You have no honor if you
use that now against us.

Shut up!

Anybody else, any last words?

Please, please don't
shoot, I was kidding.

573
00:34:19,066 --> 00:34:21,271
- I won't kill anybody.
- Stay still!

574
00:34:21,273 --> 00:34:22,521
Please!

575
00:34:22,523 --> 00:34:23,481
Shoot him, what
are you waiting for?

576
00:34:23,483 --> 00:34:26,106
He's not gonna shoot him.

577
00:34:26,108 --> 00:34:28,606
He's the perfect
person for the gun.

578
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,774
The one that won't use it.

Because you were the
first to exit the maze

618
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:26,898
I am gonna reward you with this.

619
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,731
And not far from here
you will find a crate

containing a few potentially
game-changing supplies.

you get there safely.

choose to share it

First thought to
have been a hoax,

00:42:44,275 --> 00:42:46,648
Stephanie Rogers
brutally murdered 16 men

641

and broadcast her kills
live on the internet.

642

at the Starkweather
Federal Penitentiary

644

prior to her acceptance in
this year's Jurassic Games.

645
00:42:55,983 --> 00:42:59,314
She'll use her charms to
seduce the men in the game,

646
00:42:59,316 --> 00:43:02,481
just like a black widow
luring them into her trap,

I have to do some
fluff piece interview.

652
00:43:16,441 --> 00:43:18,648
I'm joined now
by Savannah Black.

653
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:20,689
She is the director of the
controversial sensation

654
00:43:20,691 --> 00:43:23,023
known around the globe
as the Jurassic Games.

655
00:43:23,025 --> 00:43:25,314
Savannah, thank you for
joining us this afternoon.

656
00:43:25,316 --> 00:43:26,898
Oh, my pleasure Jack,
thank you for having me.

657
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:27,898
Let's begin right off the bat

658
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,689
with the morality issue here.

659
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:31,481
Uh, excuse me?

660
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:32,856
Well you know
as well as anybody

661
00:43:32,858 --> 00:43:34,856
the show is
controversial, even still.

662
00:43:34,858 --> 00:43:36,523
Are we still discussing this?

663
00:43:36,525 --> 00:43:39,523
The contestants on our show
are going to die anyway.

664
00:43:39,525 --> 00:43:42,689
Now what we're doing, with
the support of the government,

665
00:43:42,691 --> 00:43:46,481
I might add, is giving
them a chance at freedom.

666
00:43:46,483 --> 00:43:47,939
But some say this is too much.

667
00:43:47,941 --> 00:43:49,606
Isn't this really nothing
more than exploitation

668
00:43:49,608 --> 00:43:53,523
of these contestants
for money, for ratings?

669
00:43:53,525 --> 00:43:57,148
And you are essentially torturing
them on live television.

670
00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:00,731
Well I'm not concerned
with a vocal minority.

671
00:44:00,733 --> 00:44:02,189
A lot more people
love the games.

672
00:44:02,191 --> 00:44:04,523
300 million the
last time I looked.

673
00:44:04,525 --> 00:44:06,148
It's what the people want.

674
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:07,606
You didn't answer my question.

675
00:44:07,608 --> 00:44:09,564
Well they are still
dying by lethal injection.

676
00:44:09,566 --> 00:44:11,314
- Yes, but...
- Listen.

677
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:13,106
We didn't invent this.

678
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,606
As much as I'd like
to take credit for it,

679
00:44:14,608 --> 00:44:16,898
public execution is nothing new.

680
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:19,314
Think back to the days
of the Roman Empire.

681
00:44:19,316 --> 00:44:20,939
The gladiators fought
tigers and there was

682
00:44:20,941 --> 00:44:23,856
a Coliseum filled with people
wanting the tiger to win

683
00:44:23,858 --> 00:44:26,148
and most often it did.

684
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:28,273
Now at least on our show
one of our contestants

685
00:44:28,275 --> 00:44:29,731
is guaranteed to live.

686
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:30,981
What about Anthony Tucker?

687
00:44:30,983 --> 00:44:32,564
There are a lot of folks
out there who believe

688
00:44:32,566 --> 00:44:34,564
he was wrongly convicted
of killing his wife.

689
00:44:34,566 --> 00:44:35,898
Well he was convicted
in a court of law

690
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,523
and sentenced to death.

691
00:44:37,525 --> 00:44:39,481
And that is the only
qualification required

692
00:44:39,483 --> 00:44:41,023
to enter the games.

693
00:44:41,025 --> 00:44:43,398
Oh, that and they
look good on camera.

694
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,314
But wouldn't you agree
having an innocent contestant

695
00:44:45,316 --> 00:44:47,148
killed on your show does
nothing more than fuel the fire

696
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:48,939
for groups like The Cavemen?

697
00:44:48,941 --> 00:44:50,273
I'm not familiar with them.

698
00:44:50,275 --> 00:44:51,481
You're trying to tell
me you've never heard

699
00:44:51,483 --> 00:44:52,981
of The Cavemen?

700
00:44:52,983 --> 00:44:56,439
I am aware of a very few
and extremely disorganized...

701
00:44:56,441 --> 00:44:59,106
Come on, it's well-known
they have promised

702
00:44:59,108 --> 00:45:01,606
to disrupt the ending
of this year's games.

703
00:45:01,608 --> 00:45:02,981
Surely you're aware.

704
00:45:02,983 --> 00:45:04,689
Well groups like
that have tried before.

705
00:45:04,691 --> 00:45:06,731
But our security is
tight, and I am confident

706
00:45:06,733 --> 00:45:09,314
that the games will go
on as they always do.

707
00:45:09,316 --> 00:45:10,898
Now we are approaching
our next challenge

708
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,106
and your audience
won't wanna miss that.

709
00:45:13,108 --> 00:45:16,023
Savannah Black, thank
you for joining us.

710
00:45:16,025 --> 00:45:17,898
Oh, thank you Jack.

711
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,733
Asshole!

712
00:45:19,858 --> 00:45:22,064
Volunteering for the games
is an admission of guilt!

713
00:45:22,066 --> 00:45:23,731
These aren't people,
they're murderers.

714
00:45:23,733 --> 00:45:26,023
God, I've had it up to
here with The Cavemen.

715
00:45:26,025 --> 00:45:27,398
People have a
right to protest.

716
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,814
Okay, protesting is one thing

717
00:45:28,816 --> 00:45:30,731
but threatening to
disrupt the show's ending,

718
00:45:30,733 --> 00:45:33,814
whatever the hell that's supposed
to mean, is unacceptable.

719
00:45:33,816 --> 00:45:35,648
You don't like the show?

720
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:37,314
Well neither do I,
and do you know why?

721
00:45:37,316 --> 00:45:38,773
Because there's a winner.

722
00:45:38,775 --> 00:45:41,148
One of these lunatics
gets to walk away free.

723
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:43,148
And it makes me sick.

724
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:45,066
If it were up to me they'd
all be dead already.

725
00:45:49,233 --> 00:45:51,733
[tense music]

726
00:46:02,358 --> 00:46:04,525
[roaring]

727
00:46:13,275 --> 00:46:15,025
That thing is huge.

728
00:46:31,608 --> 00:46:34,273
So why did you
enter the lottery?

729
00:46:34,275 --> 00:46:36,523
Same reason as everybody.

730
00:46:36,525 --> 00:46:37,358
Freedom.

731
00:46:40,108 --> 00:46:43,066
You really didn't
do it, did you?

732
00:46:44,108 --> 00:46:45,775
That's what I heard.

733
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:51,066
Doesn't matter
much now, does it?

734
00:46:56,983 --> 00:46:58,398
Why do you think
they picked dinosaurs

735
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,398
to be the things we're
running away from?

736
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,398
[laughs]

737
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,398
It tested better than robots.

738
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,023
[chuckles mirthlessly]

739
00:47:05,025 --> 00:47:06,314
Look I dunno
man, gimme the map.

740
00:47:06,316 --> 00:47:07,731
You don't even know
how to operate it.

741
00:47:07,733 --> 00:47:09,648
I don't give a
damn, gimme the map!

742
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:10,856
Kiss my ass!

743
00:47:10,858 --> 00:47:12,398
[screaming]

744
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,400

[hitting]

747
00:47:31,941 --> 00:47:32,775
Help me!

748
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,356
He's gonna die
anyway, leave his ass.

749
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:43,941
No, he's gonna finish,
he's gonna make it.

750
00:47:49,275 --> 00:47:50,941
This is it for me.

751
00:47:54,066 --> 00:47:58,483
I was never gonna help you
anyway, you piece of shit.

752
00:48:01,025 --> 00:48:05,983
Your mom's gonna
follow me to hell.

753
00:48:09,566 --> 00:48:14,066
[shouting]
[stomping]

754
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:19,481
It's nothing.

755
00:48:19,483 --> 00:48:20,689
Calm down!

756
00:48:20,691 --> 00:48:21,523
I'm not playing
this game anymore.

757
00:48:21,525 --> 00:48:22,358
I'm done!

758
00:48:25,066 --> 00:48:26,066
You hear me?

759
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:27,983
I quit!

760
00:48:28,983 --> 00:48:31,523
- Put me back in my cell...
- Hey!

761
00:48:31,525 --> 00:48:32,358
I quit!

762
00:48:33,733 --> 00:48:35,689
I'm not playing
this game anymore!

763
00:48:35,691 --> 00:48:38,398
Hey!
[punches]

764
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,733
It's you and me!

765
00:48:40,608 --> 00:48:41,814
It's you and me!

766
00:48:41,816 --> 00:48:44,606
We gotta stay together, focus!

767
00:48:44,608 --> 00:48:45,441
You focus.

768
00:48:46,525 --> 00:48:47,358
Focus.

769
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:59,023
Well you didn't see
that coming, did ya?

770
00:48:59,025 --> 00:49:01,689
Our contestants are
tired, they're hungry.

771
00:49:01,691 --> 00:49:04,023
The Wasp is gone, but I have
a feeling it's about to get

772
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:07,689
a whole lot tougher
for our remaining six.

773
00:49:07,691 --> 00:49:09,858
[Woman] And we're clear.

774
00:49:10,983 --> 00:49:12,439
How close are they
to the supplies?

775
00:49:12,441 --> 00:49:15,108
They're approaching right now.

776
00:49:16,025 --> 00:49:18,191
The buzzards are circling.

777
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:23,358
[pterodactyls squawking]

778
00:49:34,025 --> 00:49:36,773
Welcome, contestants, and
congratulations on your success

779
00:49:36,775 --> 00:49:38,273
and survival.

780
00:49:38,275 --> 00:49:41,439
We're down to the final six
but we seem to be missing one.

781
00:49:41,441 --> 00:49:43,441
Ah, there she is.

782
00:49:44,358 --> 00:49:46,691
The odds-on favorite to win.

783
00:49:47,733 --> 00:49:48,731
I'm gonna kill you.

784
00:49:48,733 --> 00:49:49,939
[laughs]

785
00:49:49,941 --> 00:49:51,858
I sincerely doubt it.

786
00:49:53,066 --> 00:49:55,689
Beyond the red barrier
you will find two items

787
00:49:55,691 --> 00:49:58,356
that may be of some use to you.

788
00:49:58,358 --> 00:50:01,773
A knife, and, more importantly,
some more ammunition

789
00:50:01,775 --> 00:50:04,106
for your laser gun there.

790
00:50:04,108 --> 00:50:08,358
All you have to do is just
walk from here to there.

791

00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:30,941
There are 17 mines...

Uh, well, maybe 20,
I can't remember.

795
00:50:36,275 --> 00:50:37,814
Between you and your reward.

796
00:50:37,816 --> 00:50:39,064
Don't worry.

797
00:50:39,066 --> 00:50:40,814
Stephanie's map will
guide you through.

798
00:50:40,816 --> 00:50:42,316
Use it to survive.

not going through!

00:50:56,608 --> 00:50:57,731

Come on brother, come
on through, come on.

Well there goes Cain and Abel.

822

I'm not gonna do another
interview like that,

823
00:52:23,566 --> 00:52:24,564
not during the games.

824
00:52:24,566 --> 00:52:25,731
That was an ambush.

825
00:52:25,733 --> 00:52:26,606
Hey, look at these
ratings though.

826
00:52:26,608 --> 00:52:28,106
Look at 'em.

827
00:52:28,108 --> 00:52:32,273
And nice work, by the way,
Brian, with the pterodactyl.

828
00:52:32,275 --> 00:52:37,231
I gotta say, I am really
happy with our final four.

829
00:52:37,233 --> 00:52:39,606
You know Jack mentioned a
direct threat from The Cavemen.

[sighs]

831
00:52:40,775 --> 00:52:41,814
He said they're
threatening to disrupt

832
00:52:41,816 --> 00:52:42,898
the ending of the show.

833
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,523
Oh, The Cavemen.

834
00:52:44,525 --> 00:52:46,314
What are they going to
do Savannah, huh?

835
00:52:46,316 --> 00:52:47,564
What are they gonna do?

836
00:52:47,566 --> 00:52:48,773
Every year they
say the same shit.

837
00:52:48,775 --> 00:52:51,023
Every year nothing
happens except for what?

838
00:52:51,025 --> 00:52:52,439
More controversy.

839
00:52:52,441 --> 00:52:55,939
Controversy leads to excitement,
more excitement leads to

840
00:52:55,941 --> 00:52:57,106
more viewers.

841
00:52:57,108 --> 00:52:59,398
Hell, I love The Cavemen.

842
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,773
Status report.

843
00:53:00,775 --> 00:53:01,606
Four remaining contestants
are relatively close

844
00:53:01,608 --> 00:53:03,314
to each other.

845
00:53:03,316 --> 00:53:04,939
Shut down most
of the main systems

846
00:53:04,941 --> 00:53:08,439
while I load the traps
and weather simulation.

847
00:53:08,441 --> 00:53:09,439
[sighs]

848
00:53:09,441 --> 00:53:10,689
You what, hey, hey.

849
00:53:10,691 --> 00:53:13,731
Why don't you let 'em
breathe for a minute?

850
00:53:13,733 --> 00:53:14,606
Never know.

851
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:15,608
Maybe one of the
girls'll get naked.

852
00:53:17,775 --> 00:53:18,775
[birds calling]

853
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:23,150
[tense music]

854
00:53:35,316 --> 00:53:37,816
She's watching us, you know.

855
00:53:44,233 --> 00:53:46,564
Maybe you oughta
give me that clip.

856
00:53:46,566 --> 00:53:48,066
Come and get it.

857
00:53:50,025 --> 00:53:52,689
I'd go look for her but I
don't wanna leave you alone.

858
00:53:52,691 --> 00:53:53,525
With him.

859
00:53:54,733 --> 00:53:55,733
Smart man.

860
00:53:57,525 --> 00:54:01,566
You move one inch closer
to me and I'll gut you.

861
00:54:03,066 --> 00:54:03,900
Alright.

862
00:54:05,316 --> 00:54:06,150
Alright.

863
00:54:11,025 --> 00:54:12,025
It's fine.

864
00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:00,233
You're not much
older than my daughter.

865
00:55:03,816 --> 00:55:04,900
I was asleep.

866
00:55:07,608 --> 00:55:11,108
And I heard a noise
and I went downstairs.

867
00:55:15,775 --> 00:55:18,566
And the door had
been pried open.

868
00:55:22,233 --> 00:55:25,731
And I went to the kids'
rooms and I made sure

869
00:55:25,733 --> 00:55:28,650
they were okay,
they were sleeping.

870
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:34,566
And then I went back to my room.

871
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:40,566
And I found my wife
with her throat slit.

872
00:55:45,525 --> 00:55:49,941
She was covered in blood
and her eyes were wide open.

873
00:55:55,816 --> 00:55:59,566
The murder weapon was
a knife from my kitchen

874
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:03,731
and they said that I had
pried the door open myself

875
00:56:03,733 --> 00:56:06,816
to make it seem like
a home invasion.

876
00:56:10,566 --> 00:56:13,900
And I was convicted
and I was sentenced.

877
00:56:18,983 --> 00:56:20,483
You're just a kid.

878
00:56:25,941 --> 00:56:29,439
I'm gonna take
you to the final two

879
00:56:29,441 --> 00:56:31,358
and I'm gonna kill you.

880

[gun firing]

884
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,233
Tucker!

885
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,398
I know you're close!

886
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,233
Tucker!

887
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:21,148
[branch snaps]

888
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:25,566

[shouting]

889
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,233
Tucker!

[laughing]

893
01:00:25,316 --> 01:00:26,814
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's come to my attention

894
01:00:26,816 --> 01:00:29,314
that one of our witnesses
would like to share something

895
01:00:29,316 --> 01:00:30,606
with us.

896
01:00:30,608 --> 01:00:32,691
[crying]

897
01:00:34,483 --> 01:00:39,439
He killed someone close
to you, didn't he?

898
01:00:39,441 --> 01:00:40,441
My husband.

899
01:00:43,108 --> 01:00:47,608
And now you feel like you
finally have some closure.

900
01:00:48,691 --> 01:00:51,358
Yes, yes I do.

901
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:55,483
Hey, hey, it's okay.

902
01:00:56,983 --> 01:00:59,898
That is a natural feeling.

903
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:01,733
And we all understand.

904
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:06,481
We're very close to finding out

905
01:01:06,483 --> 01:01:08,148
who will win this year's games.

906
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:09,316
Don't go away.

907
01:01:10,941 --> 01:01:12,814
Holy shit, who is this?

908
01:01:12,816 --> 01:01:13,981
[applauding]

909
01:01:13,983 --> 01:01:16,648
Whoa, the best
actress award goes to,

910
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:17,648
what was your name, sweetie?

911
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:19,356
- Alison.
- Alison.

912
01:01:19,358 --> 01:01:20,439
Give it up for Alison.

913
01:01:20,441 --> 01:01:21,606
She almost had me crying.

914
01:01:21,608 --> 01:01:23,023
[laughing]

915
01:01:23,025 --> 01:01:24,023
Can you believe that?

916
01:01:24,025 --> 01:01:25,273
We need more of her, seriously.

917
01:01:25,275 --> 01:01:26,814
Find out whoever her
acting class was.

918
01:01:26,816 --> 01:01:30,941
I'm gonna go get a drink,
I'm a little emotional.

919
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,608
[coughing]

920
01:02:54,108 --> 01:02:56,856

[breathing heavily]

923
01:04:00,566 --> 01:04:01,400
My kids.

924
01:04:03,566 --> 01:04:05,689
If you can hear me.

925
01:04:05,691 --> 01:04:07,398
I love you.

926
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:09,148
I'm coming home.

927
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:10,356
Dad!

928
01:04:10,358 --> 01:04:12,231
Do you hear that?

929
01:04:12,233 --> 01:04:13,566
I'm coming home!

930
01:04:14,691 --> 01:04:16,941
[groaning]

931
01:04:34,525 --> 01:04:36,775
[coughing]

932
01:04:59,733 --> 01:05:02,608
[Joy] You're not
looking so good.

933
01:05:14,191 --> 01:05:16,939
You're the one
that's gonna kill me?

934
01:05:16,941 --> 01:05:20,189
Oh honey, you're already dead.

935
01:05:20,191 --> 01:05:22,191
[kicks]

936
01:05:23,983 --> 01:05:26,233
[growling]

937
01:05:30,275 --> 01:05:31,439
We're getting immense
pressure from the press

938
01:05:31,441 --> 01:05:33,481
to comment on
Tucker's innocence.

939
01:05:33,483 --> 01:05:34,773
[groans]

940
01:05:34,775 --> 01:05:35,939
Okay, well here's my
comment to the press.

941
01:05:35,941 --> 01:05:38,398
He was sentenced to death.

942
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,814
Okay we have run the numbers

943
01:05:39,816 --> 01:05:42,398
and it could be a ratings
disaster if he dies in the game.

944
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,856
Are you out of your mind?

945
01:05:43,858 --> 01:05:44,856
What do you want?

946
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:46,106
You know what?

947
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:50,025
Come to me live as soon
as the tiger's finished.

948
01:05:53,483 --> 01:05:55,941
[flatlining]

949
01:05:56,941 --> 01:05:58,606
Only two remain.

950
01:05:58,608 --> 01:06:03,356
Joy, the heartless teenage
killer, ruthless and crazy.

951
01:06:03,358 --> 01:06:06,023
Who knows why, who cares?

952
01:06:06,025 --> 01:06:10,189
And Tucker, a family man who
callously murdered his wife

953
01:06:10,191 --> 01:06:12,191
in cold blood.

954
01:06:12,566 --> 01:06:15,316
Presumed innocent
by some of you.

955
01:06:17,025 --> 01:06:18,150
Listen to me.

956
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:20,983
I am not the judge.

957
01:06:22,108 --> 01:06:23,775
We are not the jury.

958
01:06:25,525 --> 01:06:26,650
But the game.

959
01:06:28,941 --> 01:06:31,275
The game is the executioner.

960
01:06:32,483 --> 01:06:36,150
And the game decides
who lives and who dies.

961
01:06:38,941 --> 01:06:40,814
Uh oh, we've got a problem.

962
01:06:40,816 --> 01:06:42,523
We just received an
encrypted message.

963
01:06:42,525 --> 01:06:43,773
From The Cavemen?

964
01:06:43,775 --> 01:06:46,398
No, from here,
inside the premises.

965
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:47,856
Open the final doorway.

966
01:06:47,858 --> 01:06:50,148
The last challenge begins now.

967
01:06:50,150 --> 01:06:52,858
[dramatic music]

968
01:07:13,233 --> 01:07:14,316
I told you!

969
01:07:15,733 --> 01:07:19,650
I told you I'd bring you
to the final two with me!

970
01:07:35,441 --> 01:07:37,856
Excuse me, I need to
get to master control.

971
01:07:37,858 --> 01:07:38,775
Sit down.

972
01:07:42,566 --> 01:07:45,064
We've intercepted an encoded
transmission coming from

973
01:07:45,066 --> 01:07:46,900
- the premises.
- Really?

974
01:07:48,066 --> 01:07:49,064
What did it say?

975
01:07:49,066 --> 01:07:50,064
We don't know.

976
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:52,648
I was hoping you could tell me.

977
01:07:54,648 --> 01:07:58,564
We traced the transmission
back to your edit bay, Laura.

978
01:07:58,566 --> 01:08:01,733
Have you been sending
encoded messages?

979
01:08:03,523 --> 01:08:05,314
I'm going to kill The Host.

980
01:08:05,316 --> 01:08:06,273
On live TV.

981
01:08:07,607 --> 01:08:08,440
Tonight.

[gun fires]

983
01:08:14,566 --> 01:08:18,064
No matter what you do,
the show will continue.

984
01:08:18,066 --> 01:08:20,314
It's bigger than me,
than you, than anyone!

985
01:08:20,316 --> 01:08:23,816
You'll never...
[gun fires]

986
01:09:00,357 --> 01:09:02,357
[spits]

987
01:09:03,982 --> 01:09:05,980
Let's do this.

988
01:09:05,982 --> 01:09:07,480
Patience, Tucker.

989
01:09:07,482 --> 01:09:09,980
Joy, you are the favorite
to win this thing, you know.

990
01:09:09,982 --> 01:09:11,146
Eat shit!

991
01:09:11,148 --> 01:09:12,646
That's the spirit.

992
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:16,189
Tucker, I'm not sure anyone
expected you to get this far

993
01:09:16,191 --> 01:09:19,105
but there are millions of people
rooting for you out there.

994
01:09:19,107 --> 01:09:23,690
In fact, we have a very
special message from your kids.

995
01:09:24,982 --> 01:09:26,898
Survive, Dad, please.

996
01:09:28,523 --> 01:09:29,689
We know you're innocent.

997
01:09:29,691 --> 01:09:30,773
Get him out of the games.

998
01:09:30,775 --> 01:09:32,607
- Stop the games!
- Andy.

999
01:09:35,857 --> 01:09:37,275
Bring 'em back.

1000
01:09:39,107 --> 01:09:41,814
Bring 'em back, bring 'em back!

1001
01:09:41,816 --> 01:09:43,566
Bring 'em back to me!

1002
01:09:44,566 --> 01:09:45,398
Ow!

1003
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,691
[groaning]

1004
01:09:52,857 --> 01:09:54,107
Why so upset?

1005
01:09:55,525 --> 01:09:57,730
We are giving you a
chance to see them again.

1006
01:09:57,732 --> 01:09:59,564
I mean really if it wasn't
for our little show here,

1007
01:09:59,566 --> 01:10:01,400
you'd already be dead.

1008
01:10:02,732 --> 01:10:05,565
And let the final
challenge begin.

1009
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,898
Well, this is an easy game.

1010
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:22,564
Now you will notice that
you are each chained

1011
01:10:22,566 --> 01:10:24,314
to those locks.

1012
01:10:24,316 --> 01:10:25,939
There are padlocks at
the end of your chains

1013
01:10:25,941 --> 01:10:28,189
that need to be unlocked
for you to cross the outer

1014
01:10:28,191 --> 01:10:29,191
finish line.

1015
01:10:30,566 --> 01:10:34,064
Be the first to do so, and your
opponent will be eliminated.

1016
01:10:34,066 --> 01:10:34,900
You win!

1017
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:37,273
The keys.

1018
01:10:37,275 --> 01:10:38,980
Excuse me?

1019
01:10:38,982 --> 01:10:41,105
I don't think I
quite caught that.

1020
01:10:41,107 --> 01:10:43,730
Where are the keys
to unlock the padlocks?

1021
01:10:43,732 --> 01:10:44,855
There are two.

1022
01:10:44,857 --> 01:10:46,773
One for each of you.

1023
01:10:46,775 --> 01:10:48,480
Buried in the sand
somewhere between

1024
01:10:48,482 --> 01:10:51,023
where you stand and the locks.

1025
01:10:51,025 --> 01:10:54,107
Are you ready in
three, two, one, go!

1026
01:10:55,691 --> 01:10:58,316
[intense music]

1027
01:11:07,941 --> 01:11:08,775
Tucker.

1028
01:11:10,691 --> 01:11:14,773
Do you know why I threw
in my name for the games?

1029
01:11:14,775 --> 01:11:17,148
I don't care about my freedom.

1030
01:11:17,150 --> 01:11:20,189
Hell, being in here is as
close as I could ever hope

1031
01:11:20,191 --> 01:11:21,358
to being free.

1032
01:11:25,107 --> 01:11:27,773
A girl that does things that
I do won't last very long

1033
01:11:27,775 --> 01:11:30,439
in the real world
anyway, you know?

1034
01:11:30,441 --> 01:11:32,814
[kicks]

1035
01:11:32,816 --> 01:11:34,523
I wanted to meet you!

1036
01:11:34,525 --> 01:11:35,814
[cries out]

1037
01:11:35,816 --> 01:11:38,855
Convicted killer that
the whole world loves.

1038
01:11:38,857 --> 01:11:40,814
The man that wanted
to join the games

1039
01:11:40,816 --> 01:11:44,564
so he could see his
precious kids again.

1040
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:46,064
The man that everyone cried over

1041
01:11:46,066 --> 01:11:47,898
when his sentence was given.

1042
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:48,980
I mean what the hell?

1043
01:11:48,982 --> 01:11:50,650
You talk too much.

1044
01:11:51,566 --> 01:11:54,105
[laughs]

1045
01:11:54,107 --> 01:11:56,355
She cried for you.

1046
01:11:56,357 --> 01:11:57,525
She missed you.

1047
01:11:58,732 --> 01:12:00,355
She said that you were
gonna come save her

1048
01:12:00,357 --> 01:12:02,689
and I really wish you
would have because I was

1049
01:12:02,691 --> 01:12:04,605
so tired of waiting.

1050
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:07,064
[hits]

1051
01:12:07,066 --> 01:12:09,900
I'm here to finish
what I started!

1052
01:12:11,691 --> 01:12:15,773
I can't let the whole
world see you go free!

1053
01:12:15,775 --> 01:12:20,939
I'm gonna cause one more
moment of chaos and heartbreak

1054
01:12:20,941 --> 01:12:24,191
before I leave this
disgusting world!

1055
01:12:28,066 --> 01:12:31,314
I killed your bitch of a
wife and I would do it again

1056
01:12:31,316 --> 01:12:34,480
[punching]
and again and again

1057
01:12:34,482 --> 01:12:37,400
if I could!

1058
01:12:38,357 --> 01:12:39,523
Yes.

1059
01:12:39,525 --> 01:12:41,273
Yes, this is perfect,
this is perfect.

1060
01:12:41,275 --> 01:12:43,148
This is awesome!

1061
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:44,355
You knew?

1062
01:12:44,357 --> 01:12:47,065
Well, I mean,
you know, we hoped.

1063
01:12:51,066 --> 01:12:54,066
See you in hell,
you piece of shit!

1064
01:12:56,941 --> 01:12:58,105
What did you say to me?

1065
01:12:58,107 --> 01:13:00,357
I said I killed your wife.

1066
01:13:01,816 --> 01:13:04,023
What did you say to me?

1067
01:13:04,025 --> 01:13:05,355
Uh, give me a rex.

1068
01:13:05,357 --> 01:13:06,564
Bring in a rex.

1069
01:13:06,566 --> 01:13:09,064
I said I killed her, ah!

1070
01:13:09,066 --> 01:13:10,648
I'm gonna kill you.

1071
01:13:10,650 --> 01:13:11,939
Where, Savannah!

1072
01:13:11,941 --> 01:13:13,108
We need a rex.

1073
01:13:14,107 --> 01:13:15,355
Will you just, where is she?

1074
01:13:15,357 --> 01:13:16,730
Do I have to do
everything myself?

1075
01:13:16,732 --> 01:13:18,023
Just bring it out.

1076
01:13:18,025 --> 01:13:19,023
Savannah!

1077
01:13:19,025 --> 01:13:21,273
[laughing]

1078
01:13:21,275 --> 01:13:23,441
[roaring]

1079
01:14:11,816 --> 01:14:13,189
Come on.

1080
01:14:13,191 --> 01:14:14,814
Oh God, get out of the way!

1081
01:14:14,816 --> 01:14:17,316
Let's have some fun, shall we?

1082
01:14:24,150 --> 01:14:26,316
[roaring]

1083
01:15:01,316 --> 01:15:03,064
What are they doing, why
aren't they attacking them?

1084
01:15:03,066 --> 01:15:04,523
We programmed them
to behave the same way

1085
01:15:04,525 --> 01:15:06,480
that they would in nature
and they're very territorial.

1086
01:15:06,482 --> 01:15:07,689
We've never had
this many at once

1087
01:15:07,691 --> 01:15:08,564
so I don't know what
they're gonna do.

1088
01:15:08,566 --> 01:15:09,898
Well then fix it!

1089
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:12,066
[roaring]

1090
01:15:45,732 --> 01:15:48,565
Oh shit!

[eerie music]

- Pull him out now.
- What?

1097
01:17:57,941 --> 01:17:59,189
[gun cocks]

1098
01:17:59,191 --> 01:18:02,230
Whoa, whoa, Laura,
what are you doing?

1099
01:18:02,232 --> 01:18:03,898
Wake him up, slowly.

1100
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:05,439
Brian, go to
commercial, right now.

1101
01:18:05,441 --> 01:18:07,564
No Brian, bring it here, now.

1102
01:18:07,566 --> 01:18:08,814
Laura, look at me, look at me.

1103
01:18:08,816 --> 01:18:11,355
This has to be some kind
of a misunderstanding.

1104
01:18:11,357 --> 01:18:13,773
The game is over for good.

1105
01:18:13,775 --> 01:18:14,773
Okay.

1106
01:18:14,775 --> 01:18:15,773
Where's Savannah?

1107
01:18:15,775 --> 01:18:16,730
Savannah!

1108
01:18:16,732 --> 01:18:17,939
This has gone on long enough!

1109
01:18:17,941 --> 01:18:19,230
Tonight this is over.

1110
01:18:19,232 --> 01:18:21,230
There will be no
more Jurassic Games.

1111
01:18:21,232 --> 01:18:23,023
Okay, Laura, what are you,
stop, what are you doing?

1112
01:18:23,025 --> 01:18:23,939
This is crazy.

1113
01:18:23,941 --> 01:18:24,855
Jeff.

1114
01:18:24,857 --> 01:18:25,773
Are you serious?

1115
01:18:25,775 --> 01:18:26,814
I've known you 10 years.

1116
01:18:26,816 --> 01:18:27,689
Are you kidding me?

1117
01:18:27,691 --> 01:18:28,648
What is happening right
now, are you crazy?

1118
01:18:28,650 --> 01:18:29,648
[Laura] You're going in.

1119
01:18:29,650 --> 01:18:30,480
What?

1120
01:18:30,482 --> 01:18:31,314
No!

1121
01:18:31,316 --> 01:18:32,148
Stop!

1122
01:18:32,150 --> 01:18:32,980
Stop it right now!

1123
01:18:32,982 --> 01:18:33,815
Stop it!

1126
01:18:47,607 --> 01:18:49,900
If I don't call off that
T-Rex, it will kill him.

1127
01:18:51,650 --> 01:18:52,730
You're not gonna shoot me.

Bring it to me live, now.

It's over, everyone.

1132
01:19:00,025 --> 01:19:01,564
It's over.

1133
01:19:01,566 --> 01:19:04,855
Now watch this evil piece
of shit learn his lesson.

1134
01:19:04,857 --> 01:19:05,855
Back to the desert.

1135
01:19:05,857 --> 01:19:06,690
Do it!

Alright.

Come on baby, make it good.

[Reporter] We all know by now

1148
01:21:38,691 --> 01:21:40,230
the terrible events
that occurred

1149
01:21:40,232 --> 01:21:42,939
during the finale of this past
season of the Jurassic Games.

1150
01:21:42,941 --> 01:21:44,814
People all over the
world are still mourning

the death of the beloved host.

1152
01:21:46,857 --> 01:21:49,148
It was tragic for sure.

1153
01:21:49,150 --> 01:21:50,980
But, you know what they say.

1154
