<i>September 30th, 1939.</i>

3
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:11,213
<i>We were herded
onto prison trains near Grodno.</i>

4
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,382
<i>Conditions were
very cramped and damp.</i>

5
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,519
<i>It is very hard to sleep.</i>

6
00:01:19,853 --> 00:01:23,891
<i>I don't know how long some of
the other injured men can last.</i>

7
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:28,028
<i>The icicles that form
on the window grill</i>

8
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,999
<i>provide the only drinking water.</i>

9
00:01:36,237 --> 00:01:38,874
<i>October 9th, 1939.</i>

10
00:01:40,841 --> 00:01:42,676
<i>We are off the train at last.</i>

11
00:01:44,044 --> 00:01:47,948
<i>Now, apparently, we are
no longer prisoners but guests.</i>

12
00:01:49,216 --> 00:01:51,952
<i>On several occasions,
NKVD officers</i>

13
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,890
<i>have summoned some of us for
interrogation during the night.</i>

14
00:01:57,525 --> 00:02:00,961
<i>With this sort of madness,
it is little wonder</i>

15
00:02:01,128 --> 00:02:04,332
<i>that we are at a loss
as to what should be done.</i>

16
00:02:08,034 --> 00:02:10,237
<i>March 20th, 1940.</i>

17
00:02:11,906 --> 00:02:15,576
<i>It seems the Soviets are taking
a softer line with us now.</i>

18
00:02:16,944 --> 00:02:20,948
<i>Rumors are rife among the men
that our release is imminent.</i>

19
00:02:24,117 --> 00:02:26,420
<i>April 15th, 1940.</i>

20
00:02:27,855 --> 00:02:31,125
<i>At last. My prayers
have finally been answered.</i>

21
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:33,994
<i>My name was read out
this morning.</i>

22
00:02:35,162 --> 00:02:36,629
<i>Spring is in the air,</i>

23
00:02:37,164 --> 00:02:40,000
<i>and I have not felt this alive
in many months.</i>

24
00:02:41,368 --> 00:02:44,004
<i>My hope is that
this is the last time</i>

25
00:02:44,137 --> 00:02:46,908
<i>I will ever have to
travel like this.</i>

26
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:21,742
No need to be so keen, lad.

27
00:03:24,212 --> 00:03:25,814
Suicide, most likely.

28
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,015
Sir.

29
00:03:33,386 --> 00:03:34,288
Oh, wonderful.

30
00:03:40,427 --> 00:03:42,363
Hopefully, that will be
his suicide note.

31
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,067
Poor sod.

32
00:03:48,002 --> 00:03:50,571
- Right. Let's get him up.
- Yes, sir.

33
00:03:52,105 --> 00:03:53,007
Mind your step.

34
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,780
British military
occupation ends in Iraq.

35
00:04:01,248 --> 00:04:04,619
Western Post! British
military occupation ends in Iraq.

36
00:04:05,218 --> 00:04:07,254
So... Sandy can cover the docks.

37
00:04:07,987 --> 00:04:09,523
McCloud, the Redcliffe stuff,

38
00:04:10,525 --> 00:04:14,162
and John gets the union story...
for his sins.

39
00:04:15,062 --> 00:04:16,063
Nothing too controversial.

40
00:04:17,063 --> 00:04:19,165
Underwood, the Cider Festival.

41
00:04:19,265 --> 00:04:21,236
That's it.

42
00:04:22,036 --> 00:04:22,837
Off you go.

43
00:04:28,008 --> 00:04:30,245
Hey, I said no.

44
00:04:31,445 --> 00:04:34,049
No one wants to hear
about suicide, Stephen.

45
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:35,315
Not now.

46
00:04:36,183 --> 00:04:38,053
It's bad for circulation.

47
00:04:39,152 --> 00:04:40,254
What if it's not suicide?

48
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,023
I have a contact up at the camp.

49
00:04:43,858 --> 00:04:45,059
Stephen, dear boy,

50
00:04:45,592 --> 00:04:49,063
did the police
give any indication

51
00:04:49,597 --> 00:04:52,767
that they thought it might be
anything other than suicide?

52
00:04:55,234 --> 00:04:56,104
No.

53
00:04:56,203 --> 00:04:57,204
Exactly.

54
00:04:58,037 --> 00:05:00,140
So please don't try my patience.

War's a terrible thing
and many can't cope,

57
00:05:05,044 --> 00:05:06,347
and there's the end of it.

58
00:05:07,582 --> 00:05:09,084
There's no story here.

59
00:05:10,484 --> 00:05:11,785
Do I make myself clear?

60
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:14,254
Yes.

61
00:05:14,654 --> 00:05:16,291
Right. Thank you. Off you go.

62
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,137
Can you file this, Maisie?
Thanks.

63
00:05:34,974 --> 00:05:36,743
- Rose?
- Yes, Mr. Underwood.

64
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,649
Have you, er, ever been
to the Cider Festival?

65
00:05:56,097 --> 00:05:57,298
Good evening, Mr. Underwood.

66
00:05:58,065 --> 00:06:00,135
- Late again?
- I had to work.

67
00:06:01,436 --> 00:06:02,169
I see.

68
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,140
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

69
00:06:42,342 --> 00:06:46,212
<i>Despite the passing of the Polish
Resettlement Act earlier this year,</i>

70
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:50,183
<i>the West Country is witnessing a growing
number of unexplained suicides.</i>

71
00:06:51,185 --> 00:06:54,655
<i>The men are all ex-servicemen
from the Polish Second Corps.</i>

72
00:06:55,488 --> 00:06:58,859
<i>A coincidence? Or could this be
something more sinister?</i>

73
00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:23,318
- Morning.
- Morning.

74
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,419
- Can I help you?
- I'm here to see the Captain.

75
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,722
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

76
00:08:05,058 --> 00:08:05,926
One moment, sir.

77
00:08:09,063 --> 00:08:12,267
Sir, Colonel Pietrowski's arrived
with the two DPs from Stowell Park.

78
00:08:14,068 --> 00:08:14,969
Once we're done here,

79
00:08:15,368 --> 00:08:16,337
tell the Quartermaster
to make an inventory

80
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,905
of everything we're short of. Double
it, and put in a written order.

81
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:19,774
Yes, Captain.

82
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:21,308
Morning.

83
00:08:33,786 --> 00:08:35,355
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

84
00:08:41,528 --> 00:08:43,130
This all seems to be in order.

85
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,131
If you'd like to
bring them in, Colonel,

86
00:08:45,265 --> 00:08:46,634
there are just a few
signatures required.

87
00:08:47,034 --> 00:08:47,769
Of course.

88
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,805
Colonel, perhaps you
and your man

89
00:08:51,905 --> 00:08:53,741
would like a spot of breakfast
before the drive home?

90
00:08:55,108 --> 00:08:56,910
We don't have much,
but it's hot.

91
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:59,379
- Thank you. That's very kind.
- Er, Jeanette...

92
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,515
once you're finished, would you drop
the Colonel's aide off at the mess?

93
00:09:02,616 --> 00:09:03,451
Yes, sir.

94
00:09:04,485 --> 00:09:05,286
John.

95
00:09:12,558 --> 00:09:13,895
I'll talk to you later.

96
00:09:14,327 --> 00:09:15,395
- This way, Colonel.
- Colonel.

97
00:09:17,063 --> 00:09:20,601
My name's Stephen Underwood.
The Captain is my brother.

98
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,969
I'm a journalist for
The Western Post.

99
00:09:23,602 --> 00:09:25,238
Colonel Janusz Pietrowski,

100
00:09:25,338 --> 00:09:26,806
formerly of the Polish
Second Corps,

101
00:09:26,906 --> 00:09:28,508
Acting Resettlement
Corps Liaison.

102
00:09:29,776 --> 00:09:32,145
- Colonel, pleased to meet you.
- And me you, Mr. Underwood.

103
00:09:32,746 --> 00:09:33,514
Shall we?

104
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,859
Colonel?

105
00:09:45,358 --> 00:09:46,726
I said no, Stephen.

106
00:09:47,361 --> 00:09:49,496
Please, Captain.
Your brother's very welcome.

107
00:09:49,663 --> 00:09:51,698
I was wondering if
you'd like to comment on the...

108
00:09:52,366 --> 00:09:54,401
suicide of another
Polish soldier yesterday?

109
00:09:55,334 --> 00:09:56,570
Sosnowicz.

110
00:09:57,672 --> 00:09:59,373
You don't look
very surprised, Colonel.

111
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,309
Well, Mr. Underwood,
it's always most distressing

112
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:04,477
when a proud man loses all hope.

113
00:10:05,312 --> 00:10:06,513
And why
would that be, Colonel?

114
00:10:07,514 --> 00:10:11,552
Men like Sosnowicz spent the war
fighting for their homeland, Mr. Underwood,

115
00:10:11,885 --> 00:10:13,419
which is now part
of the Soviet Union,

116
00:10:13,553 --> 00:10:15,622
which regards them
as enemies of the state.

117
00:10:16,557 --> 00:10:19,260
He'd just learned his entire
family had been murdered.

118
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,595
Colonel, please,
we have no proof of that.

119
00:10:22,395 --> 00:10:25,232
Clearly, he believed it
enough to take his own life, Captain.

120
00:10:25,665 --> 00:10:27,200
And why do you believe it,
Colonel?

121
00:10:28,401 --> 00:10:31,237
Because we all seem to have
forgotten that in 1939

122
00:10:31,371 --> 00:10:33,274
the Soviet Union invaded Poland,

123
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:37,178
in alliance with the Nazis and with
the same intent, Mr. Underwood.

124
00:10:38,478 --> 00:10:39,979
To wipe Poland from the map.

125
00:10:40,614 --> 00:10:43,418
To destroy its culture,
and its people.

126
00:10:45,052 --> 00:10:47,989
When the Soviets
retook Poland in 1944,

127
00:10:48,622 --> 00:10:51,424
they allowed the Nazis
to crush the Warsaw Uprising

128
00:10:52,358 --> 00:10:54,895
to help eliminate any possible
threat to their own occupation.

129
00:10:56,429 --> 00:11:00,267
The recent so-called "free"
elections in Poland

130
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,303
are no more than
a Soviet puppet show.

131
00:11:04,438 --> 00:11:06,907
No, Poland's true government
is still exiled in London,

132
00:11:07,406 --> 00:11:10,610
but it is no longer recognized
by Britain or the United States.

133
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:13,480
And last year,
the Free Polish Armed Forces

134
00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:15,715
were excluded from
your Victory Parade.

135
00:11:16,683 --> 00:11:18,685
So as not to antagonize
Comrade Stalin.

136
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,521
What does this tell you,
Mr. Underwood?

137
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:23,925
That all is well?

138
00:11:28,728 --> 00:11:30,797
I understand the world
is weary of war.

139
00:11:31,631 --> 00:11:32,732
We all are.

140
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,036
But that's no excuse
for naivety.

141
00:11:37,438 --> 00:11:38,505
Your brother knows this.

142
00:11:40,606 --> 00:11:43,209
He still has the unenviable
task of trying to persuade

143
00:11:43,309 --> 00:11:45,611
my fellow compatriots
to return to Poland,

144
00:11:46,447 --> 00:11:48,881
knowing full well he cannot
guarantee their safety.

145
00:11:49,683 --> 00:11:51,852
No one has to go back
if they don't want to, Colonel.

146
00:11:54,454 --> 00:11:56,523
Yes, Captain. Of course.

147
00:12:00,293 --> 00:12:03,331
Colonel, please.
Breakfast is waiting.

148
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,679
- Mm.
- I have to see you tonight.

149
00:12:20,347 --> 00:12:23,583
- Eight thirty, at the King's Arms.
- No, that's too public.

150
00:12:23,717 --> 00:12:25,318
No, there are only ever
locals there.

151
00:12:25,819 --> 00:12:27,554
Mm. Fine.

152
00:12:28,356 --> 00:12:29,155
Eight-ish?

153
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,529
I have to go.
Mason wants to see me.

154
00:12:35,661 --> 00:12:36,696
Do you have to?

155
00:12:37,364 --> 00:12:39,100
You know I do.

156
00:13:07,528 --> 00:13:08,262
Come.

157
00:13:09,597 --> 00:13:11,598
Ah! Thank you, Stanley.

158
00:13:17,337 --> 00:13:18,404
You're still on duty?

159
00:13:18,972 --> 00:13:20,574
I hardly ever see you
out of uniform these days.

160
00:13:23,577 --> 00:13:24,712
You hardly see me at all.

161
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,181
I know, I'm sorry. There's a bit
of a flap on at the moment.

162
00:13:27,747 --> 00:13:28,616
Anyway, good of you to come.

163
00:13:29,817 --> 00:13:33,587
We've been invited to the
annual ball at the Robinsons'.

164
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:36,257
Oh, God. Is it that
time of year already?

165
00:13:36,356 --> 00:13:38,757
I know, tedious in
the extreme, but, er...

166
00:13:38,924 --> 00:13:41,661
I would really appreciate it if we
could attend together this year.

167
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:45,366
- Your parents will be there.
- I'd rather not, if it's all the same to you.

168
00:13:46,601 --> 00:13:49,169
It might look at bit odd if, er,
if I go alone.

169
00:13:49,836 --> 00:13:52,573
Might set a few tongues wagging.

170
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,241
- If we must.
- Splendid.

171
00:13:56,643 --> 00:13:57,611
Oh!

172
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,379
One more thing before you go.

173
00:14:00,045 --> 00:14:01,848
You might be in
the perfect place

174
00:14:02,582 --> 00:14:04,250
to do me another favor,
if you would?

175
00:14:04,651 --> 00:14:07,621
Er... Loboda and Nowak,

176
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,556
two DPs who arrived
in your camp this morning.

177
00:14:09,655 --> 00:14:11,925
You're very well informed,
as always.

178
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:16,096
Could you be a real brick and keep
me appraised of their whereabouts?

179
00:14:16,563 --> 00:14:18,665
Movements, visitors, friends,
that sort of thing.

180
00:14:19,432 --> 00:14:20,200
Why?

181
00:14:20,768 --> 00:14:23,771
It's probably nothing.
Some vague memo from London.

182
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,674
Nothing to worry about.
Just so I know.

183
00:14:28,741 --> 00:14:30,777
I wouldn't expect you to run
across town every morning.

184
00:14:30,877 --> 00:14:32,711
A simple telephone call
will suffice.

185
00:14:33,246 --> 00:14:36,850
I know you must be busy with your
whole repatriation commotion.

186
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:38,919
- Yes.
- Mm.

187
00:14:40,821 --> 00:14:41,889
Is that all?

188
00:14:44,256 --> 00:14:45,859
Well, I should be getting back.

189
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,496
Oh, please, don't let me
detain you any longer.

190
00:14:49,663 --> 00:14:51,664
Er, but if we could, er...

191
00:14:52,097 --> 00:14:53,700
keep this just
between ourselves?

192
00:14:54,168 --> 00:14:54,935
Of course.

193
00:14:56,669 --> 00:14:57,804
So we're happy then?

194
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,707
What?

195
00:15:01,741 --> 00:15:05,045
- The Robinsons' ball?
- Yes. Yes.

196
00:15:05,712 --> 00:15:06,680
- Fine.
- Hmm.

197
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,973
You know why he
married you, hmm?

198
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:40,814
He is not the monster
you want him to be.

199
00:15:41,715 --> 00:15:45,086
So your father has the right to
sell you to the highest bidder?

200
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:51,025
They genuinely thought
he would make a good husband.

201
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,763
They only want
what's best for me.

202
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:03,404
Did they know?

203
00:16:07,507 --> 00:16:09,542
Marriage isn't
about love for them.

204
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,279
And I wanted to marry him.

205
00:16:14,948 --> 00:16:15,949
I was in love with him.

206
00:16:18,851 --> 00:16:21,188
Obviously, I didn't know then
what I know now.

207
00:16:22,755 --> 00:16:24,625
But our love
is of a different kind now.

208
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,764
Stephen, he's my friend.

209
00:16:32,765 --> 00:16:33,767
It's a lie.

210
00:16:34,867 --> 00:16:36,569
So what do you want me to do?

211
00:16:37,938 --> 00:16:40,073
You want me to just
leave my husband, my job,

212
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,976
turn my back on my family
and run off to London with you?

213
00:16:43,776 --> 00:16:44,978
That's impossible.

214
00:16:48,781 --> 00:16:50,916
I'm not sure how much faith
I have in your big story

215
00:16:51,016 --> 00:16:52,986
because if what the Polish
Colonel says is true,

216
00:16:53,086 --> 00:16:53,854
you have no proof.

217
00:16:54,821 --> 00:16:56,490
And as unfortunate as they are,

218
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,225
these suicides
are still just that.

219
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:01,861
Suicides. Nothing more.

220
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:19,780
- Evening, gents. What can I get you?
- Er, how much for this?

221
00:17:21,381 --> 00:17:23,016
- Fourpence.
- Hmm.

222
00:17:23,117 --> 00:17:25,052
- And for this?
- Thruppence-ha'penny.

223
00:17:27,352 --> 00:17:28,823
Two pints of the Special,
please, sir.

224
00:17:30,923 --> 00:17:31,825
Slops for swine.

225
00:18:16,069 --> 00:18:17,504
- Same again, sir?
- Please.

226
00:18:19,104 --> 00:18:20,473
Bloody scab labour.

227
00:18:22,042 --> 00:18:23,677
There's talk of letting 'em
down the mines next.

228
00:18:24,111 --> 00:18:27,179
The war's over.
Send the buggers back, I say.

229
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,883
Instead of giving 'em
our boys' jobs.

230
00:18:32,084 --> 00:18:33,920
Can't go back
because of the Bolshies?

231
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,092
Well, you won't escape
the Reds here, son.

232
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,928
Not with the Labour Party
running the country.

233
00:18:43,096 --> 00:18:46,966
- You know nothing.
- Who's asking you, Polak?

234
00:18:52,304 --> 00:18:54,908
I am not Polak. I am Russian.

235
00:18:55,007 --> 00:18:57,844
What do I care? You're all
the bloody same. Now go home!

236
00:18:57,945 --> 00:18:59,846
- All right, we're going.
- Well, go on then!

237
00:18:59,946 --> 00:19:01,115
- Hey, we are going.
- And don't come back!

238
00:19:02,082 --> 00:19:03,382
You're not welcome here!

239
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,120
All right, Bill. It's still my name
above the door. That's enough.

240
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:17,798
We're leaving.

241
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,772
Eh, lad, what about your drinks?

242
00:19:29,976 --> 00:19:31,011
Stephen?

243
00:19:34,046 --> 00:19:34,814
Stephen?

244
00:19:48,928 --> 00:19:50,997
Mr. Nowak, it's me, Jeanette
Mitchell, from the camp.

245
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,634
Yes, er...
we have to get back, sorry.

246
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,970
He said he was a Russian.

247
00:19:59,105 --> 00:20:00,606
I write for a newspaper.

248
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,976
I just want to ask you
a few questions.

249
00:20:04,011 --> 00:20:05,546
No.

250
00:20:07,013 --> 00:20:09,949
You're a Russian,
pretending to be a Pole, why?

251
00:20:11,784 --> 00:20:13,253
Mr. Loboda, please!

252
00:20:16,989 --> 00:20:19,625
I am not pretending
to be anyone.

253
00:20:21,194 --> 00:20:25,032
If you saw what I saw,
then you understand.

254
00:20:26,432 --> 00:20:28,534
- What have you seen?
- Ivan.

255
00:20:30,003 --> 00:20:32,840
They kill you like
they want to kill me.

256
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:38,077
Who wants to kill you?

257
00:20:39,012 --> 00:20:40,047
They all do.

258
00:20:43,582 --> 00:20:44,351
Stephen?

259
00:20:57,996 --> 00:20:59,565
- Stephen...
- I'm fine.

260
00:21:10,043 --> 00:21:11,145
Please, Stephen.

261
00:21:13,446 --> 00:21:16,082
- What did he have?
- I don't remember.

262
00:21:16,682 --> 00:21:18,618
Clothes mainly. Hardly anything.

263
00:21:21,854 --> 00:21:24,557
Don't do this.
You heard what he said.

264
00:21:26,292 --> 00:21:28,093
Don't you think if, er...

265
00:21:29,062 --> 00:21:31,064
someone wanted to kill him,
they would have done so already?

266
00:21:31,864 --> 00:21:33,299
Not if they don't know
who he is.

267
00:21:33,323 --> 00:21:35,323

268
00:21:42,242 --> 00:21:43,911
He could be involved
in the suicides.

269
00:21:44,843 --> 00:21:46,179
Loboda could be the story.

270
00:21:50,048 --> 00:21:50,883
Let me do this.

271
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:53,719
For us.

272
00:24:58,103 --> 00:24:58,971
It's Polish.

273
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,476
He could be keeping it
for a friend.

274
00:25:04,509 --> 00:25:05,278
No.

275
00:25:06,912 --> 00:25:09,448
Rose. Rose Miller,
the typist at work.

276
00:25:10,416 --> 00:25:11,784
Her family's from Poland.

277
00:25:13,085 --> 00:25:14,220
She could translate it for me.

278
00:25:14,321 --> 00:25:17,457
No! What about Loboda?
What if he discovers it's gone?

279
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,692
Tell me things don't go missing
around here all the time.

280
00:25:19,792 --> 00:25:21,761
Are you drunk?
What if he thinks it was me?

281
00:25:22,261 --> 00:25:25,065
Mm, just put him off
for a while.

282
00:25:27,266 --> 00:25:29,535
I thought this was supposed
to be about us?

283
00:25:34,506 --> 00:25:35,308
It is.

284
00:25:36,543 --> 00:25:39,313
Because it seems like you want
me to take all the risks.

285
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:46,019
Give me the box.

286
00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:53,994
I need to do this.

287
00:26:46,379 --> 00:26:47,380
Huh!

288
00:26:54,387 --> 00:26:56,990
Ah.

289
00:27:49,708 --> 00:27:50,476
Mr. Underwood?

290
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:54,080
I did it.
The story, the Cider Festival.

291
00:27:56,415 --> 00:27:59,452
Thank you.
I need another favor.

292
00:27:59,753 --> 00:28:02,254
- Of course, anything.
- I need this translated.

293
00:28:02,755 --> 00:28:04,489
If you can ask your father.

294
00:28:05,057 --> 00:28:07,460
- What's it about?
- I don't know.

295
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,729
Again, just between us.

296
00:28:13,431 --> 00:28:14,601
As soon as you can.

297
00:28:24,444 --> 00:28:25,645
Stephen Underwood.

298
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,261
Stephen!

299
00:28:43,795 --> 00:28:45,465
They can't find him anywhere.

300
00:28:49,268 --> 00:28:51,003
My sincere apologies
again, Colonel.

301
00:28:51,103 --> 00:28:53,805
The truth is, Captain, Mr. Loboda
has a habit of disappearing,

302
00:28:54,474 --> 00:28:57,677
as Mr. Nowak knows all too well.
He's a very troubled man.

303
00:28:58,076 --> 00:29:00,313
Sometimes his imagination
gets the better of him.

304
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:01,848
We'll find him.

305
00:29:19,265 --> 00:29:20,800
Are you going to tell them
about the box?

306
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,369
Still think I did
the wrong thing?

307
00:29:37,882 --> 00:29:39,552
He can't just have disappeared.

308
00:29:40,152 --> 00:29:43,622
The Poles have moved him again.
Find out where!

309
00:29:56,768 --> 00:29:58,771
<i>Morning, Mabel.
Is Richard in yet?</i>

310
00:30:00,739 --> 00:30:03,175
My father wanted to know
where you got these from.

311
00:30:08,581 --> 00:30:09,381
Why?

312
00:30:10,417 --> 00:30:11,516
He said they're extremely
valuable

313
00:30:11,617 --> 00:30:12,652
and that you should be careful.

314
00:30:15,187 --> 00:30:16,022
Thank you.

315
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:27,632
<i>I don't
understand what is happening.</i>

316
00:30:28,266 --> 00:30:30,635
<i>Earlier, our train
stopped at a siding.</i>

317
00:30:31,169 --> 00:30:33,872
<i>We were met by Soviet guards
and ordered to disembark.</i>

318
00:30:34,841 --> 00:30:36,409
<i>There is a large forest here.</i>

319
00:30:37,776 --> 00:30:39,746
<i>We have loaded into
black prison vans.</i>

320
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:41,815
<i>I have to stop writing now.</i>

321
00:32:19,711 --> 00:32:21,146
Yes, sir, can I help you?

322
00:32:21,813 --> 00:32:23,382
I'm looking for
a Colonel Pietrowski.

323
00:32:23,716 --> 00:32:24,751
Yes, sir, follow me.

324
00:32:27,719 --> 00:32:28,755
Colonel Pietrowski.

325
00:32:31,923 --> 00:32:32,958
Can I get you anything?

326
00:32:36,896 --> 00:32:37,731
You don't mind?

327
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:50,776
Why would a Russian...

328
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:56,216
have the diary, letters
and personal effects

329
00:32:56,315 --> 00:32:57,883
of a young Polish cadet,

330
00:32:58,383 --> 00:33:01,887
interned in a POW camp
in the Soviet Union?

331
00:33:02,721 --> 00:33:03,756
And, er...

332
00:33:05,557 --> 00:33:07,192
why does he think
everyone wants to kill him?

333
00:33:10,729 --> 00:33:13,966
I really have no idea what you are
talking about, Mr. Underwood.

334
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,601
If you'll excuse me,
I have things to attend to.

335
00:33:16,735 --> 00:33:17,603
I have the box.

336
00:33:20,104 --> 00:33:21,073
I want to help.

337
00:33:21,774 --> 00:33:24,407
No, Mr. Underwood,
you want a story.

338
00:33:24,409 --> 00:33:26,779
Yes, I want the story, and then
we both get what we want.

339
00:33:27,845 --> 00:33:29,448
Trust me, there's nothing
you can do.

340
00:33:29,782 --> 00:33:32,252
If you really want to help,
then return the box to me.

341
00:33:32,752 --> 00:33:33,787
Let me see Loboda.

342
00:33:34,986 --> 00:33:36,790
Goodbye, Mr. Underwood.

343
00:33:38,791 --> 00:33:40,794
Colonel. Colonel!

344
00:33:42,928 --> 00:33:43,996
Then I'll...

345
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:47,267
take this to the authorities and
I'll tell them where I got it.

346
00:33:50,002 --> 00:33:51,838
I had the diary and letters
translated.

347
00:33:56,809 --> 00:33:58,011
Come with me.

348
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:09,923
Wait here.

349
00:34:43,622 --> 00:34:45,825
My aide will take you
to see Mr. Loboda.

350
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:47,659
So you do know where he is?

351
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:54,432
Once you know the truth,
you can try as you might,

352
00:34:54,532 --> 00:34:56,334
but I will not support you
in this any further.

353
00:34:56,903 --> 00:34:59,305
I will deny any involvement,
any knowledge of this at all

354
00:34:59,405 --> 00:35:00,907
and you will not see
Loboda again.

355
00:35:03,008 --> 00:35:04,142
Do I make myself clear?

356
00:35:20,858 --> 00:35:22,961
Here, at five o'clock.

357
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:24,898
We will pick you up
and take you to him.

358
00:35:26,564 --> 00:35:27,400
You come alone.

359
00:35:28,566 --> 00:35:30,035
How do I know I can trust you?

360
00:35:31,037 --> 00:35:32,038
You don't.

361
00:35:32,939 --> 00:35:35,909
Then I'd like to, er,
interview Loboda.

362
00:35:36,842 --> 00:35:38,945
- And I'd like it recorded.
- Why?

363
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,514
Once you have the box,
I have nothing.

364
00:35:44,916 --> 00:35:46,119
That can be arranged.

365
00:35:47,153 --> 00:35:50,023
And, er, I'll take those
translations, if you don't mind.

366
00:35:55,128 --> 00:35:55,928
Thank you.

367
00:36:43,709 --> 00:36:45,644
I expect you to pay
for the damage.

368
00:36:46,043 --> 00:36:47,746
- Who did this?
- The police.

369
00:36:48,747 --> 00:36:52,184
They said they suspected you of being
in possession of contraband goods.

370
00:36:52,383 --> 00:36:54,119
That's ridiculous,
and you know it.

371
00:36:54,419 --> 00:36:56,688
Well, I'm sorry, but, er...

372
00:36:56,988 --> 00:37:01,026
with all your comings and goings
lately I really couldn't say.

373
00:37:02,028 --> 00:37:05,030
This is still my house...

374
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:07,467
as far as I'm aware,
Mr. Underwood.

375
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:25,517
Nettie.

376
00:37:28,854 --> 00:37:30,056
Nettie, please.

377
00:37:31,856 --> 00:37:32,657
I'm sorry.

378
00:37:33,992 --> 00:37:37,262
- What is it?
- They've taken the box.

379
00:37:39,231 --> 00:37:40,066
Then it's over.

380
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:43,869
- I'm going to see Loboda.
- You know where he is?

381
00:37:44,202 --> 00:37:45,237
Pietrowski has him.

382
00:37:46,338 --> 00:37:48,240
So how do you know
they didn't take it?

383
00:37:48,608 --> 00:37:51,044
Because I said I'd give back the
box if they let me talk to him.

384
00:37:52,276 --> 00:37:53,579
How do you know
they're not lying?

385
00:37:53,678 --> 00:37:55,847
You have no idea who
these people really are.

386
00:37:56,881 --> 00:37:57,849
I need to know.

387
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:00,686
It has nothing to do with you.

388
00:38:07,726 --> 00:38:09,195
If anything happens to me,

389
00:38:10,195 --> 00:38:11,664
I want you to give these
to the police.

390
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,168
But...

391
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,336
Stay here.

392
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:11,811
They tell me I can trust you.

393
00:41:13,378 --> 00:41:15,280
That I can tell you everything.

394
00:41:18,215 --> 00:41:19,017
Yes.

395
00:41:20,418 --> 00:41:21,853
You took the box?

396
00:41:27,258 --> 00:41:29,262
How can I trust a thief?

397
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:34,066
I didn't mean any harm.

398
00:41:35,934 --> 00:41:37,336
You put it in your paper?

399
00:41:40,939 --> 00:41:42,508
I'll do everything I can.

400
00:41:46,477 --> 00:41:47,345
Please sit down.

401
00:42:39,597 --> 00:42:42,034
My name is Ivan Krivozertsev.

402
00:42:46,303 --> 00:42:48,374
My home is near Smolensk.

403
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,208
Small town.

404
00:42:51,343 --> 00:42:52,545
Nove Biatoki.

405
00:42:55,314 --> 00:42:59,151
I was there
when they first come.

406
00:43:14,832 --> 00:43:16,836
<i>People say
they were Finns.</i>

407
00:43:19,537 --> 00:43:21,373
<i>But my friend Kisselev...</i>

408
00:43:23,874 --> 00:43:27,412
<i>he saw their four-cornered hats.</i>

409
00:43:34,352 --> 00:43:36,188
They were all Polish.

410
00:43:40,858 --> 00:43:44,462
Every day, they put them in
<i>chornly voron.</i>

411
00:43:45,396 --> 00:43:48,467
<i>Prison vans.
Move to forest.</i>

412
00:44:20,631 --> 00:44:26,639
In forest, Bolsheviks tie
their hands behind backs.

413
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:30,042
<i>A rope
round the neck...</i>

414
00:44:31,876 --> 00:44:34,712
<i>so you strangle if you move.</i>

415
00:44:42,653 --> 00:44:43,755
They put them...

416
00:44:45,423 --> 00:44:46,257
<i>K zemie.</i>

417
00:44:47,425 --> 00:44:48,160
<i>To ground.</i>

418
00:44:50,061 --> 00:44:50,962
<i>And they put...</i>

419
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:52,932
<i>guns...</i>

420
00:44:55,066 --> 00:44:56,568
<i>to back of the neck.</i>

421
00:44:59,704 --> 00:45:00,939
One after another...

422
00:45:02,474 --> 00:45:04,943
bodies fall into the pit...

423
00:45:08,246 --> 00:45:10,615
face to ground.

424
00:45:16,521 --> 00:45:19,991
And guns loaded
for the next group.

425
00:45:21,459 --> 00:45:23,496
Over and over again...

426
00:45:24,662 --> 00:45:27,099
until job finish.

427
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:39,778
When Germans come,
they have Polyaki too.

428
00:45:40,477 --> 00:45:41,546
<i>Prisoners.</i>

429
00:45:42,613 --> 00:45:45,082
<i>Making roads good for tanks.</i>

430
00:45:48,486 --> 00:45:50,356
<i>First,
Germans did not look.</i>

431
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:53,592
<i>Only Polyaki look.</i>

432
00:46:07,671 --> 00:46:10,742
<i>Then I tell
what I saw...</i>

433
00:46:14,878 --> 00:46:17,248
and we begin to dig.

434
00:46:24,756 --> 00:46:29,361
<i>Book and letters
I took from dead man.</i>

435
00:46:30,729 --> 00:46:31,730
<i>Young man.</i>

436
00:46:49,381 --> 00:46:50,149
Where was this?

437
00:46:52,784 --> 00:46:53,651
Where did it happen?

438
00:46:59,557 --> 00:47:02,428
In forest, at Katyn.

439
00:47:28,653 --> 00:47:29,688
How many?

440
00:47:31,423 --> 00:47:34,392
To date, over 4,000 bodies.

441
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:38,429
But there are three times that
still missing.

442
00:47:40,131 --> 00:47:45,770
Mostly officers, reservists,
lawyers, teachers... priests.

443
00:47:46,604 --> 00:47:50,442
Stalin knew these people would
never capitulate to Soviet rule.

444
00:47:51,977 --> 00:47:54,946
And Poles know all about being
occupied by foreign powers,

445
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:56,881
and these were
the best of my country.

446
00:47:57,648 --> 00:48:00,652
They would fight for their freedom
with everything they had.

447
00:48:04,822 --> 00:48:06,757
Stalin murdered them so Poland

448
00:48:07,425 --> 00:48:09,762
could never again
rise from the ashes.

449
00:48:11,628 --> 00:48:12,930
And the British?

450
00:48:14,832 --> 00:48:15,668
They knew about this?

451
00:48:16,401 --> 00:48:17,336
Of course they did.

452
00:48:18,436 --> 00:48:21,038
The British and Americans just
wanted the whole affair to go away.

453
00:48:21,639 --> 00:48:24,709
They needed the Red Army
to keep fighting the Germans.

454
00:48:24,809 --> 00:48:27,178
They feared Stalin
would make peace with Hitler.

455
00:48:29,113 --> 00:48:32,383
Now, Stalin has half of Europe under
his boot, and they can do nothing.

456
00:48:34,686 --> 00:48:36,722
And my country is occupied.

457
00:48:37,856 --> 00:48:39,725
And no criticism
of Stalin is tolerated.

458
00:48:41,659 --> 00:48:43,128
My people
are good people.

459
00:48:45,863 --> 00:48:47,699
You must know what happened.

460
00:48:49,668 --> 00:48:50,702
You must know murderer.

461
00:48:53,171 --> 00:48:54,406
We need the evidence.

462
00:48:55,374 --> 00:48:57,709
The diary, the letters.

463
00:48:59,043 --> 00:49:02,746
Proof the murders were
committed in 1940 by the Soviets.

464
00:49:03,747 --> 00:49:07,318
And not by the Nazis in 1941,
as everyone believes.

465
00:49:13,892 --> 00:49:14,993
You did bring the box?

466
00:49:21,066 --> 00:49:22,568
It was stolen from my room.

467
00:49:32,744 --> 00:49:33,778
Please!

468
00:49:56,733 --> 00:49:57,802
Yes?

469
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:01,840
What, now?

470
00:50:02,974 --> 00:50:03,776
Why?

471
00:50:07,945 --> 00:50:09,247
Fine, I'll be five minutes.

472
00:50:18,956 --> 00:50:21,325
What the bloody hell are you playing at?
It's the middle of the night.

473
00:50:21,793 --> 00:50:23,595
- It's important.
- It better had be.

474
00:50:24,061 --> 00:50:25,963
I need to know about
a place called Katyn.

475
00:50:27,764 --> 00:50:28,799
Why?

476
00:50:29,066 --> 00:50:31,369
Polish soldiers were
taken there in 1940.

477
00:50:32,137 --> 00:50:33,671
I need to know
what happened to them.

478
00:50:34,005 --> 00:50:35,640
Has Pietrowski
put you up to this?

479
00:50:35,773 --> 00:50:36,707
No.

480
00:50:36,807 --> 00:50:38,610
Then look it up in the papers.

481
00:50:38,943 --> 00:50:41,012
I need to see
the official papers.

482
00:50:41,979 --> 00:50:43,814
And I can't help you,
you know that.

483
00:50:44,782 --> 00:50:47,251
In my position, I can't be seen
fraternizing with journalists,

484
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:49,488
even second-rate
provincial ones.

485
00:50:49,988 --> 00:50:50,856
John, please.

486
00:50:51,889 --> 00:50:53,156
This could explain
the suicides.

487
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:56,028
Over 4,000 Polish soldiers
were murdered.

488
00:50:58,930 --> 00:50:59,965
- Stand down.
- Sir.

489
00:51:04,001 --> 00:51:07,139
It was the Germans,
the Nazis, end of story.

490
00:51:07,271 --> 00:51:09,006
- You know about this.
- That's the official line.

491
00:51:09,106 --> 00:51:10,675
Yeah, but you know
that's not true.

492
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:13,044
I believe what I'm told
to believe.

493
00:51:14,345 --> 00:51:16,648
So you're going to bury your head
and let them get away with it?

494
00:51:16,814 --> 00:51:19,384
It's my job. Now, go home.

495
00:51:19,852 --> 00:51:21,953
You went to war to free people
from oppression,

496
00:51:22,153 --> 00:51:24,255
so that they had the right
to choose their own destiny.

497
00:51:24,356 --> 00:51:26,925
And you're going to stand there
and do nothing?

498
00:51:27,291 --> 00:51:28,360
Go home, Stephen.

499
00:51:29,193 --> 00:51:30,928
Stop trying to be something
you're not.

500
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:33,364
I did that.

501
00:51:33,831 --> 00:51:36,667
You went to war and I stayed.
I did what I was told.

502
00:51:38,903 --> 00:51:40,738
But for the first time,
I have something I believe in.

503
00:51:40,872 --> 00:51:42,874
Don't be such a child.
The war is over.

504
00:51:43,508 --> 00:51:44,842
Do you really want to start
another one

505
00:51:44,943 --> 00:51:46,711
just to appease your own sense
of inadequacy?

506
00:51:46,843 --> 00:51:48,213
You didn't
have to serve, be grateful.

507
00:51:50,947 --> 00:51:51,716
No.

508
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:54,085
You're right.

509
00:51:56,854 --> 00:51:59,724
I couldn't serve...
because of this.

510
00:52:13,305 --> 00:52:14,439
Philip Edwards.

511
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:17,942
Disillusioned socialist-type
I met at Cambridge.

512
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:21,113
Now works in the archive
at the Foreign Office.

513
00:52:22,345 --> 00:52:25,516
If it's in there...
he'll know where.

514
00:52:28,919 --> 00:52:30,555
This is my transport docket.

515
00:52:31,889 --> 00:52:35,126
And, er... this should
get you through the gate.

516
00:52:40,697 --> 00:52:43,567
You can improvise. Now get out.

517
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:48,472
Oh, and, Stephen,
the accident.

518
00:52:48,939 --> 00:52:52,077
It was my fault and I know you
could have lost your eyesight.

519
00:52:52,177 --> 00:52:53,111
I am sorry.

520
00:53:20,537 --> 00:53:21,405
Did you see him?

521
00:53:22,374 --> 00:53:24,076
- Yeah.
- Where is he?

522
00:53:30,948 --> 00:53:33,017
There's only one farm
in the area that grows these.

523
00:53:38,021 --> 00:53:39,224
I'm going to London.

524
00:53:40,959 --> 00:53:43,227
I need you to hold on
to those translations.

525
00:53:46,798 --> 00:53:47,599
Don't go.

526
00:53:49,568 --> 00:53:51,535
- I have to.
- Stephen...

527
00:53:57,441 --> 00:53:59,144
<i>You've let this get
out of proportion.</i>

528
00:54:00,577 --> 00:54:02,014
In spite of everything
that happened...

529
00:54:04,014 --> 00:54:06,017
you must realize
I do still care about you.

530
00:54:07,485 --> 00:54:10,255
Then... please
just leave him alone.

531
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:15,392
It's your Stephen that is
making life difficult for you.

532
00:54:15,492 --> 00:54:17,228
He dragged you into all this,
not me.

533
00:54:19,197 --> 00:54:23,235
Just... Just tell me
what he's up to.

534
00:54:26,537 --> 00:54:28,072
He knows where he is,
doesn't he?

535
00:54:31,008 --> 00:54:34,612
You must understand, this isn't
about you and Underwood anymore.

536
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:40,083
You're involving yourself
in something very sensitive

537
00:54:40,184 --> 00:54:42,053
and potentially very damaging.

538
00:54:42,653 --> 00:54:44,054
Is Stephen in danger?

539
00:54:44,521 --> 00:54:47,424
If he's told you where
they're hiding the Russian,

540
00:54:47,525 --> 00:54:49,227
you have to tell me, now.

541
00:54:54,131 --> 00:54:54,900
Look...

542
00:54:58,802 --> 00:55:00,271
you tell me what you know...

543
00:55:02,039 --> 00:55:04,075
and you can continue
to see Underwood.

544
00:55:06,209 --> 00:55:07,878
As long as you don't draw
attention to yourselves,

545
00:55:08,246 --> 00:55:10,715
I won't say another word
about it.

546
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:13,118
It will simply blow over.

547
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:18,121
I don't think either of us want any
scandal in our lives right now.

548
00:55:19,823 --> 00:55:23,360
And I think we would both do whatever we could
to ensure that doesn't happen, wouldn't we?

549
00:59:37,481 --> 00:59:41,518
You're a fool.
A pig-ignorant fool.

550
00:59:43,421 --> 00:59:45,557
Do you honestly think
anyone cares about you?

551
00:59:46,823 --> 00:59:48,392
Do you think the Poles care?

552
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:52,563
No one cares about you
or what you have to say!

553
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:02,300
Mr. Underwood?

554
01:01:03,867 --> 01:01:04,635
Yes.

555
01:01:05,401 --> 01:01:07,438
I served with your brother
in Austria.

556
01:01:08,439 --> 01:01:09,474
He's a good man.

557
01:01:17,782 --> 01:01:20,452
An address and a map.

558
01:01:23,921 --> 01:01:26,658
What you want is all very
hush-hush. It's been shelved.

559
01:01:29,226 --> 01:01:31,162
"X" marks the spot,
if you like.

560
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:39,070
Things aren't the same
anymore, Mr. Underwood.

561
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:43,073
During the war, we knew
what we needed to do.

562
01:01:43,206 --> 01:01:46,243
We knuckled down and we did it.
We didn't question anything.

563
01:01:47,410 --> 01:01:49,847
It was all very
black and white.

564
01:01:51,515 --> 01:01:52,650
But now...

565
01:01:54,251 --> 01:01:55,687
Now nothing seems
to make any sense.

566
01:01:58,322 --> 01:01:59,724
Makes you wonder
who's really in charge.

567
01:02:07,999 --> 01:02:10,034
- Can I buy you a drink?
- No.

568
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:11,936
No, I can't stay.

569
01:02:12,503 --> 01:02:14,972
If there's ever anything
I can do for you.

570
01:02:15,072 --> 01:02:17,107
No, please, don't worry.

571
01:02:19,642 --> 01:02:21,646
Anything to relieve the tedium.

572
01:02:23,113 --> 01:02:26,650
Sometimes I wonder if I'll end up
buried in that archive, you know.

573
01:02:26,782 --> 01:02:28,318
Up to my eyeballs in dust.

574
01:02:30,553 --> 01:02:31,722
Not that anybody would notice.

575
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:37,529
My regards to your brother,
and good luck.

576
01:03:22,773 --> 01:03:25,642
Captain Underwood. Will
you be requiring an escort, sir?

577
01:05:41,811 --> 01:05:45,515
<i>"On the evidence that
we have, it is difficult to escape</i>

578
01:05:45,648 --> 01:05:48,051

of Russian guilt.</i>

579
01:05:49,486 --> 01:05:52,189
<i>How, if Russian crime

584
01:06:10,541 --> 01:06:15,178

<i>"In handling the publicity

587
01:06:39,769 --> 01:06:44,006

596

602
01:09:00,244 --> 01:09:00,978
Colonel.

603
01:09:02,946 --> 01:09:03,947
I've seen the papers.

604
01:09:05,648 --> 01:09:07,919
A report by a Owen O'Malley,

605
01:09:08,884 --> 01:09:10,353
the British Ambassador
to Poland.

606
01:09:13,089 --> 01:09:14,891
You were right,
they knew all along.

607
01:09:17,928 --> 01:09:19,930
Ivan Krivozertsev is dead.

608
01:09:26,003 --> 01:09:28,104
He was found yesterday,
hanging from a tree.

609
01:09:29,339 --> 01:09:30,207
In the evening.

610
01:09:40,916 --> 01:09:44,955
So you see, Mr. Underwood, I doubt anyone will
ever be given the chance to see those papers.

611
01:09:49,559 --> 01:09:50,327
Why, er...

612
01:09:53,562 --> 01:09:54,965
Why didn't you hide him sooner?

613
01:09:57,634 --> 01:09:59,002
He wouldn't let us.

614
01:10:00,137 --> 01:10:03,006
It was only when you took
the box that he reconsidered.

615
01:10:07,710 --> 01:10:10,647
He approached the Red Cross,
joined our troops in Italy,

616
01:10:11,615 --> 01:10:13,117
where he met Mr. Nowak.

617
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:18,088
One drunken night, he let slip
he was there at Katyn...

618
01:10:19,923 --> 01:10:20,825
when it happened.

619
01:10:23,759 --> 01:10:25,028
No others made it to the West.

620
01:10:26,729 --> 01:10:30,034
He was the only one to escape the
area when the Soviets recaptured it.

621
01:10:34,804 --> 01:10:36,807
He was an embarrassment
to the Soviets.

622
01:10:39,977 --> 01:10:42,013
Awkward for the British.

623
01:10:44,046 --> 01:10:46,082
Dispensable to the Americans.

624
01:10:49,986 --> 01:10:52,023
He approached them
at Nuremberg and...

625
01:10:53,357 --> 01:10:56,227
they almost sent him back
to the Russian sector.

626
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:03,267
Did you tell anyone you
had seen him, Mr. Underwood?

627
01:11:06,635 --> 01:11:08,104
I had nothing to do with this.

628
01:11:24,987 --> 01:11:25,722
What is it?

629
01:11:27,790 --> 01:11:28,825
Who did you tell?

630
01:11:32,562 --> 01:11:33,329
Excuse me.

631
01:11:46,610 --> 01:11:49,280
I'm sorry. I can't let you in.
Orders.

632
01:11:50,246 --> 01:11:51,548
I need to talk to my brother.

633
01:11:54,217 --> 01:11:55,952
Captain Underwood's
been reassigned.

634
01:11:59,055 --> 01:12:00,290
And Lieutenant Mitchell?

635
01:12:01,424 --> 01:12:02,159
I don't know.

636
01:12:18,275 --> 01:12:20,643
- <i>Number, please?</i>
- Foreign Office Archive.

637
01:12:21,210 --> 01:12:22,312
<i>Putting you through.</i>

638
01:12:23,179 --> 01:12:24,147
<i>Archive.
How can I help you?</i>

639
01:12:24,747 --> 01:12:27,250
- Philip Edwards, please.
- <i>One moment, sir.</i>

640
01:12:28,919 --> 01:12:30,554
<i>I'm afraid Mr. Edwards
is on leave.</i>

641
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:32,089
When will he be back?

642
01:12:32,223 --> 01:12:34,390
<i>May I enquire
as to your reason for calling?</i>

643
01:12:36,893 --> 01:12:37,660
<i>Sir?</i>

644
01:12:43,198 --> 01:12:45,768
Western Post.
Come and get your Western Post.

645
01:12:46,603 --> 01:12:48,371
Western Post.
Come and get your Western Post.

646
01:12:48,504 --> 01:12:49,205
Fresh off the press!

647
01:12:51,174 --> 01:12:52,209
Thank you, sir.

648
01:12:55,245 --> 01:12:58,381
<i>Western Post. Come and get
your Western Post. Fresh off the press!</i>

649
01:12:59,582 --> 01:13:00,384
<i>Western Post!</i>

650
01:13:02,152 --> 01:13:03,153
<i>Western Post!</i>

651
01:13:04,287 --> 01:13:06,456
<i>Come and get your Western Post!
Fresh off the press!</i>

652
01:13:12,161 --> 01:13:13,229
Mr. Hamilton,
can I talk to you?

653
01:13:14,964 --> 01:13:18,201
I'm sorry, Stephen, but
you don't work here anymore.

654
01:13:19,169 --> 01:13:20,304
Excuse me?

655
01:13:21,571 --> 01:13:25,509
Lovely idea... to give the
festival to the typist.

656
01:13:25,608 --> 01:13:28,778
You were right.
She shows great promise.

657
01:13:30,179 --> 01:13:33,217
So that's why she'll be
doing your job from now on.

658
01:13:35,251 --> 01:13:39,022
Now, that's a month's pay.
Clear your desk.

659
01:13:43,326 --> 01:13:44,361
I have a story.

660
01:13:45,161 --> 01:13:46,196
I don't want to hear it.

661
01:13:55,004 --> 01:13:56,839
The British Government
is covering up the murder

662
01:13:56,973 --> 01:13:59,576
of over 15,000
Polish officers and men...

663
01:14:00,643 --> 01:14:02,278
by the Soviets in 1940.

664
01:14:05,214 --> 01:14:06,282
They sold out a whole nation.

665
01:14:08,050 --> 01:14:09,053
Their own allies.

666
01:14:09,986 --> 01:14:12,089
A country they went to war
to protect.

667
01:14:12,688 --> 01:14:14,224
And it doesn't end there.

668
01:14:16,192 --> 01:14:20,230
Yesterday evening, the last witness to
that massacre was murdered right here,

669
01:14:20,796 --> 01:14:21,698
in Bristol.

670
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:24,001
Well...

671
01:14:24,968 --> 01:14:27,204
you certainly have
a vivid imagination.

672
01:14:32,241 --> 01:14:33,443
What did they say to you, Frank?

673
01:14:34,244 --> 01:14:35,512
I beg your pardon?!

674
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:42,518
That you'd... lose your job?
Lose the paper?

675
01:14:43,253 --> 01:14:45,522
Huh? Be disgraced?

676
01:14:47,424 --> 01:14:51,461
That it's your patriotic duty
not to print this?

677
01:14:54,464 --> 01:14:57,567
If you don't leave right now,
I'll have you thrown out.

678
01:15:01,704 --> 01:15:04,340
Keep your money. I resign.

679
01:16:13,309 --> 01:16:14,343
Oh, Mr. Underwood.

680
01:16:15,312 --> 01:16:18,180
I'll be wanting to redecorate
in the very near future

681
01:16:18,313 --> 01:16:20,549
so have to ask you
to vacate your room.

682
01:16:21,384 --> 01:16:24,887
But as I'm not one to throw
anyone onto the street,

683
01:16:24,987 --> 01:16:29,159
I will of course allow you time to
find suitable alternative lodgings.

684
01:16:31,361 --> 01:16:33,831
Two weeks should be more than
enough, I'm sure you'll agree?

685
01:16:35,331 --> 01:16:36,900
And you have a visitor.

686
01:17:05,394 --> 01:17:07,030
I didn't think
this would happen.

687
01:17:12,602 --> 01:17:13,570
What did you do?

688
01:17:17,874 --> 01:17:20,110
Stephen, I just wanted you
to be safe.

689
01:17:22,178 --> 01:17:23,247
What did you do?

690
01:17:25,415 --> 01:17:29,420
Mason asked me to watch Loboda
and tell him everything.

691
01:17:32,655 --> 01:17:33,590
You told him where he was?

692
01:17:42,398 --> 01:17:44,901
Why didn't you tell me
that Mason wanted him watched?

693
01:17:46,436 --> 01:17:49,473
I didn't think it would stop you! I
thought it would make things worse!

694
01:17:50,406 --> 01:17:51,542
Worse?

695
01:17:54,611 --> 01:17:55,345
He's dead.

696
01:17:56,412 --> 01:17:58,147
They found him hanging
from a tree.

697
01:17:59,415 --> 01:18:00,150
I know.

698
01:18:01,483 --> 01:18:03,620
And if I could undo
what I've done, I would.

699
01:18:05,487 --> 01:18:09,492
I didn't think Mason was capable of
something like this. I still don't.

700
01:18:16,933 --> 01:18:18,335
What did they do with John?

701
01:18:21,604 --> 01:18:22,973
They took him to London.

702
01:18:25,576 --> 01:18:27,511
You won't be able
to see or speak to him.

703
01:18:29,545 --> 01:18:31,080
They're posting him
overseas.

704
01:18:40,924 --> 01:18:42,693
I didn't give him these.

705
01:18:45,495 --> 01:18:46,763
They mean nothing now.

706
01:18:54,437 --> 01:18:56,606
- I want you to leave.
- Stephen...

707
01:19:00,043 --> 01:19:01,577
I want you to leave now.

708
01:19:24,201 --> 01:19:27,604
An inquest before our Sovereign Lord the
King, in the parish of Flax Bourton,

709
01:19:27,737 --> 01:19:31,975
in the County of Somerset, on this
the third day of November, 1947,

710
01:19:32,509 --> 01:19:34,945
before one of the coroners
of our said Lord the King,

711
01:19:35,045 --> 01:19:39,383
for the said County of Somerset,
touching the death of Ivan Krivosertsev,

712
01:19:39,782 --> 01:19:42,753
known as Michael Loboda,
and upon the view of his body.

713
01:19:44,853 --> 01:19:46,822
Er, have the witnesses
been sworn in?

714
01:19:47,290 --> 01:19:48,024
They have, sir.

715
01:19:48,491 --> 01:19:49,560
Well, let's get going then,
shall we?

716
01:19:51,561 --> 01:19:53,330
Were about five, I'd say.

717
01:19:54,531 --> 01:19:58,402
I was down Long Orchard.
I, er, works there, you see.

718
01:20:00,370 --> 01:20:01,705
And by the rail bridge,

719
01:20:02,571 --> 01:20:04,407
coming back up
from Court House Farm.

720
01:20:06,742 --> 01:20:09,278
I sees this gentleman
hanging from a tree.

721
01:20:12,247 --> 01:20:13,616
<i>Apple tree, it were.</i>

722
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:24,094
He was hanging about eight feet
up from a leather strap.

723
01:20:26,929 --> 01:20:30,633
It appeared to me that the deceased
had placed the strap around his neck,

724
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:34,437
climbed the tree, secured
the other end to the branch

725
01:20:35,037 --> 01:20:36,572
and jumped off.

726
01:20:38,842 --> 01:20:40,811
We untied this and
lowered him to the ground.

727
01:20:41,777 --> 01:20:44,414
<i>He was already cold. Stiff.</i>

728
01:20:47,784 --> 01:20:50,652
<i>We searched the body, and
in a wallet we found three letters</i>

729
01:20:51,588 --> 01:20:53,657
<i>one of which was marked
"Secret Service."</i>

730
01:21:14,611 --> 01:21:15,644
Carry on.

731
01:21:16,679 --> 01:21:18,649
We then took him to
the mortuary at Long Ashton.

732
01:21:21,918 --> 01:21:22,853
I knew him well.

733
01:21:24,487 --> 01:21:26,723
We had been friends since 1945.

734
01:21:28,090 --> 01:21:28,858
He was happy.

735
01:21:30,125 --> 01:21:33,030
He was proud of who he
was, and what he had seen.

736
01:21:35,165 --> 01:21:38,268
He did drink a lot, but he
could stand a lot as well.

737
01:21:40,603 --> 01:21:43,774
I do not know any reason
why he should hang himself.

738
01:21:46,842 --> 01:21:47,878
He wouldn't do this.

739
01:22:01,124 --> 01:22:03,860
May it duly be recorded here,
on presentation

740
01:22:04,661 --> 01:22:07,397
of all inquiries under oath,

741
01:22:07,897 --> 01:22:11,934
that I, as appointed coroner
of the County of Somerset

742
01:22:12,034 --> 01:22:14,336
by the office of
His Majesty the King,

743
01:22:14,704 --> 01:22:18,407
on deliberating the probable cause
of death of Michael Loboda,

744
01:22:18,508 --> 01:22:21,278
also known as
Ivan Krivosertsev,

745
01:22:22,379 --> 01:22:25,015
do allege a verdict
of suicide...

746
01:22:26,715 --> 01:22:27,784
by hanging.

747
01:22:30,686 --> 01:22:33,723
These proceedings
are duly closed.

748
01:22:46,536 --> 01:22:47,938
Surely you're not
going to accept that.

749
01:22:48,370 --> 01:22:49,738
I have to accept it.

750
01:22:50,039 --> 01:22:52,776
This is now just another suicide
that no one will want to hear about.

751
01:22:52,909 --> 01:22:54,576
What about the letters
in his wallet?

752
01:22:54,710 --> 01:22:56,847
We have not been allowed
to see them.

753
01:22:57,979 --> 01:22:58,948
Why weren't they read out?

754
01:22:59,749 --> 01:23:01,351
I'm very sorry, Mr. Underwood,

755
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:04,186
but maybe if you'd not become involved,
there would be no need to know.

756
01:23:04,987 --> 01:23:09,592
Look, Colonel, I'm sorry but
I did what I thought was right.

757
01:23:11,093 --> 01:23:12,763
Did you? Really?

758
01:23:13,897 --> 01:23:14,930
We still have this.

759
01:23:15,764 --> 01:23:17,800
Testimony is worth nothing
without the man.

760
01:23:19,802 --> 01:23:22,005
Even if it's not
accepted in the courts,

761
01:23:22,872 --> 01:23:24,840
it still brings the story
out into the open.

762
01:23:25,207 --> 01:23:28,577
- That's all you need, isn't it?
- Yes, Mr. Underwood, but there's nothing more I can do.

763
01:23:29,379 --> 01:23:30,947
We have been told
in no uncertain terms

764
01:23:31,046 --> 01:23:33,715
that the newspapers
have been strongly advised

765
01:23:33,816 --> 01:23:35,018
never to raise
the subject again.

766
01:23:36,619 --> 01:23:38,054
My apologies, I have to go.

767
01:23:41,023 --> 01:23:44,260
He did not deserve this.
He was a good man.

768
01:23:53,370 --> 01:23:55,005
I'm so very sorry,
Colonel.

769
01:23:56,238 --> 01:23:57,240
I truly am.

770
01:24:07,116 --> 01:24:08,851
Don't you dare
walk away from me!

771
01:24:09,985 --> 01:24:12,988
You are just as much to blame
for this impossible situation!

772
01:24:14,022 --> 01:24:15,858
You did
what you thought was right.

773
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:18,295
And so did I.

774
01:24:20,629 --> 01:24:21,897
This is not finished.

775
01:27:59,214 --> 01:28:01,950
<i>In that moment,
when Stephen died,</i>

776
01:28:02,050 --> 01:28:03,887
<i>my life was changed forever.</i>

777
01:28:05,054 --> 01:28:08,858
<i>Everything I had believed in ws shattered
by the revelations he had uncovered</i>

778
01:28:09,192 --> 01:28:11,828
<i>and I was determined
to finish what he had started;</i>

779
01:28:13,228 --> 01:28:15,197
<i>to finally print Stephen's story</i>

780
01:28:15,298 --> 01:28:17,066
<i>and the testimony
of Michael Loboda,</i>

781
01:28:17,198 --> 01:28:19,568
<i>the last witness
to the countless Polish soldies</i>

782
01:28:19,669 --> 01:28:21,104
<i>who had died at Katyn,</i>

783
01:28:21,204 --> 01:28:24,139
<i>whatever the risks
and however long it would take.</i>

784
01:28:25,107 --> 01:28:26,142
<i>They would not be forgotten,</i>

785
01:28:27,043 --> 01:28:28,143
<i>and their testimony
would live on.</i>

786
01:30:34,568 --> 01:30:39,568
