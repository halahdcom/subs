00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:52,110
Yeah, I think I caught it
on a staple or something.

- You all right?
- Yeah, I'll live.

317

It is so great to have
you back home, Nicki.

318

It's really great to be home.

319
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:09,227

Oh, come on. Keep it together.

something nice.

No, Ben, it's really,
really sweet.

323
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:26,944
I was just looking at pictures
of us on this thing,

I can't believe you hung onto it
for me. Thank you.

Every child should have
an heirloom, I guess.

[LAUGHS] Yeah.
What'd you keep?

328
00:27:39,757 --> 00:27:40,825
The adoption record.

329
00:27:42,393 --> 00:27:44,129
Framed it and hung it
in my office.

330

That's really nice.

- Oh, wow! Look at that view.

334
00:27:56,272 --> 00:27:59,174
Yeah, sure beats looking
at your neighbors' building.

Which is what we did a lot
of in California.

Right there.

That's great! Where's she at?

344
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:34,745
She's still sleeping. She, um,
sort of had an episode.

345
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,481
Yeah, she was screaming
bloody murder in the basement.

346

She had a night terror.

348

I haven't seen her like that
even as a kid.

349
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:49,326
It was different like more...

for lost sleep.

She didn't need to stay up
with me.

Seriously?

Didn't you and Ben coin
the phrase Mama-Sis?

Touché. She always
hated it, though.

Said it sounded like incest.

369
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:46,276
It was a panic attack.

370
00:30:49,212 --> 00:30:51,382
- What?
- In the basement.

a rugby team...

and drinks grape juice. Huh!

I'm sorry that my taste is
too sophisticated for even you.

488

Tell me, did Nicole pluck
your berries...

489
00:40:20,016 --> 00:40:22,650
or did they just shrivel up
and fall off the vine?

490
00:40:22,652 --> 00:40:24,954
Okay, you know, my berries
are just fine, okay?

I knew California would make
you soft.

00:40:55,952 --> 00:40:57,952
Of course it would. All it is
a bunch

of fucking famous people

And the ocean, and fresh fruit,

And you traded all that
for the winters of Siberia?

Eighteen months ago...

I was so weak that my doctors
urged me to terminate her.

548

or something worse.

And smell the stench that filled
the room as...

they blended her up inside me...

555
