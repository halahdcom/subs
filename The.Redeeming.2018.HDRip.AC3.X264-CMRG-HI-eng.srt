[Radio Announcer] It's
also extremely grim out there

8
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:58,396
so please do take care on
the roads this evening.

00:02:58,398 --> 00:02:59,898
Gale force winds are forecast

warnings remain in place

across The Southwest
and surrounding areas.

13
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:09,284
It's really not very
pleasant at all.

00:03:09,286 --> 00:03:11,488

The search continues
for a missing patient

18
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,709
who escaped from the Seaview
secure unit earlier today.

19
00:03:21,711 --> 00:03:23,546
The resident, who
should not be approached

20
00:03:23,548 --> 00:03:24,881
is described as being -

27
00:05:44,296 --> 00:05:46,599
[Man] Hello,
can you let me in?

28
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:47,770
No, go away!

29
00:05:49,306 --> 00:05:52,075
[Man] Please, I need help!

30
00:05:52,077 --> 00:05:54,181
Well, who are you?

31
00:05:54,183 --> 00:05:56,719
[Man] I'm hurt, please!

32
00:05:56,721 --> 00:05:59,525
Can I just use your phone or
anything, just for a minute.

33
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:00,329
Please!

34
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:08,378
(bolt opens)

35
00:06:09,111 --> 00:06:10,880
What do you want?

36
00:06:10,882 --> 00:06:12,183
Do you know what time
it is, for God sake,

37
00:06:12,185 --> 00:06:13,585
what are you doing here?

38
00:06:13,587 --> 00:06:15,323
[Man] Please, let me in.

39
00:06:15,325 --> 00:06:18,328
I fell, I think
I've busted my arm.

40
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,165
Please.

41
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:28,484
Okay, well hurry before
we both freeze to death.

42
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:35,998
(door clacking shut)

43
00:06:51,264 --> 00:06:52,933
Here, put that down.

44
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,578
Sit down there.

45
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,186
You're freezing, you poor thing.

46
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,405
I'm sorry there's no electric.

47
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:16,044
The lights went out
with the storm earlier.

48
00:07:16,046 --> 00:07:17,680
And they've been flickering
on and off for ages

49
00:07:17,682 --> 00:07:19,617
but I think they finally
given up the ghost.

50
00:07:19,619 --> 00:07:21,389
Oh, I don't mind.

51
00:07:21,391 --> 00:07:24,128
It's better than
being out there.

52
00:07:29,172 --> 00:07:31,742
What the devil are you doing
out in a night like this?

53
00:07:31,744 --> 00:07:34,079
You're lucky you didn't
catch your death.

54
00:07:34,081 --> 00:07:35,951
Thanks for opening the door.

55
00:07:35,953 --> 00:07:37,753
It's fucking freezing out there.

56
00:07:37,755 --> 00:07:39,260
Yeah, precisely.

57
00:07:42,064 --> 00:07:44,570
I'll find you another blanket.

58
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,744
(yawning)

59
00:08:35,205 --> 00:08:39,345
It's fine, it's
all fine, I'm fine.

60
00:08:47,762 --> 00:08:50,632
Found a towel, this
will do won't it?

61
00:08:50,634 --> 00:08:53,140
(eerie music)

62
00:09:08,035 --> 00:09:09,205
Do I know you?

63
00:09:12,746 --> 00:09:15,017
(grunting)

64
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:17,386
What have you done to yourself?

65
00:09:17,388 --> 00:09:18,290
Let me see.

66
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:23,097
Don't be a baby, I
used to be a nurse.

67
00:09:23,099 --> 00:09:24,836
Well, I wanted to be.

68
00:09:25,806 --> 00:09:27,476
I helped the nurses.

69
00:09:30,245 --> 00:09:30,815
Anyway, let me see.

70
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,761
Well, do you think it's broken?

71
00:09:38,297 --> 00:09:42,337
When you fell did you feel
it break or hear it snap?

72
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:43,441
Fuck knows.

73
00:09:44,577 --> 00:09:46,245
I heard something but
it could have been

74
00:09:46,247 --> 00:09:49,253
the bits of wood
or twigs I fell on.

75
00:09:50,722 --> 00:09:52,292
I really need to.

76
00:09:56,901 --> 00:09:57,735
Ow!

77
00:10:01,444 --> 00:10:02,743
Yeah.

78
00:10:02,745 --> 00:10:03,380
There.

79
00:10:03,847 --> 00:10:05,150
Fuck.

80
00:10:06,354 --> 00:10:07,989
Hmm, can you move it
at all, your fingers?

81
00:10:12,832 --> 00:10:15,034
I don't think you'd be
able to move your fingers

82
00:10:15,036 --> 00:10:16,472
if it was broken.

83
00:10:16,474 --> 00:10:19,042
I remember when my
little boy broke his arm.

84
00:10:19,044 --> 00:10:20,380
And I think you'd be
in a lot more pain.

85
00:10:20,382 --> 00:10:22,049
More pain?

86
00:10:22,051 --> 00:10:25,523
It hurts like a bastard already.

87
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:27,829
How did you fall?

88
00:10:28,997 --> 00:10:31,168
I was running
and, I don't know,

89
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:34,674
I tripped over a
fucking tree stump

90
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:37,814
and bam down I fucking went.

91
00:10:37,816 --> 00:10:39,952
Look, I know you're in pain

92
00:10:39,954 --> 00:10:41,555
but I really would appreciate it

93
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,725
if you wouldn't
swear quite so much.

94
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:45,630
My husband always
swore and I hated it.

95
00:10:45,632 --> 00:10:47,065
I'm sure it's not
that necessary.

96
00:10:47,067 --> 00:10:48,167
But it hurts like...

97
00:10:48,169 --> 00:10:49,004
Like?

98
00:10:50,407 --> 00:10:51,242
Like...

99
00:10:52,846 --> 00:10:54,313
A lot.

100
00:10:54,315 --> 00:10:56,252
There, that's better.

101
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,325
Let's start again.

102
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:05,571
So we're looking at
just about the elbow.

103
00:11:07,008 --> 00:11:09,546
I think you need to take the
weight off it for a start.

104
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:16,260
There's a scarf I saw somewhere,
can use it as a sling.

105
00:11:19,332 --> 00:11:20,166
Uh.

106
00:11:23,608 --> 00:11:26,347
Sorry, can't see
a flaming thing.

107
00:11:37,001 --> 00:11:40,007
(eerie piano music)

108
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,358
(grunting)

109
00:13:08,316 --> 00:13:09,485
[Man] Hello?

110
00:13:10,355 --> 00:13:11,189
Hello!

111
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:15,528
Why are you shouting?

112
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:16,699
I'm just here.

113
00:13:17,901 --> 00:13:19,070
Found a scarf.

114
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,794
Now, let's pop this off.

115
00:13:32,965 --> 00:13:36,472
Right, just lift your
arm up a little bit.

116
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,643
Pop this through there.

117
00:13:39,645 --> 00:13:40,480
That's it.

118
00:13:41,849 --> 00:13:42,850

There, how's that, better?

125
00:14:04,028 --> 00:14:06,367
Yeah, much better, thanks.

126
00:14:08,036 --> 00:14:08,870
See?

127
00:14:10,775 --> 00:14:13,177
Told you I used to be a nurse.

128
00:14:13,179 --> 00:14:14,281
(laughing)

129
00:14:17,321 --> 00:14:21,497
I would phone for a doctor but
I'm afraid the phone is dead.

130
00:14:24,836 --> 00:14:27,973
What's silver and doesn't work?

131
00:14:27,975 --> 00:14:29,177
This telephone.

132
00:14:29,179 --> 00:14:31,847
(chuckles)

133
00:14:31,849 --> 00:14:33,886
Not that it would
make much difference.

134
00:14:33,888 --> 00:14:35,956
The lane is bad
enough in the daytime.

135
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,197
Far too dangerous at night.

136
00:14:42,004 --> 00:14:44,138
I doubt you'd be able to
get a signal either my love,

137
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,678
middle of nowhere,
hadn't you noticed?

138
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,519
I've got no
battery left anyway.

139
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:56,600
It's okay, just let
me warm up a bit

140
00:14:57,901 --> 00:15:01,041
and rest and I'll
get out of your way.

141
00:15:02,745 --> 00:15:04,680
You wanna go back
out there again?

142
00:15:04,682 --> 00:15:05,915
In this?

143
00:15:05,917 --> 00:15:07,586
You wanna break
your neck as well?

144
00:15:07,588 --> 00:15:10,025
(light zaps)

145
00:15:11,162 --> 00:15:13,832
And then there was light.

146
00:15:13,834 --> 00:15:15,335
Yay!

147
00:15:15,337 --> 00:15:17,940
(laughing)

148
00:15:17,942 --> 00:15:19,544
Oh thank goodness.

149
00:15:19,546 --> 00:15:21,214
(chuckles)

150
00:15:21,216 --> 00:15:24,054
(creepy echoes)

151
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:30,498
You okay?
(electrical buzz)

152
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,335
Oh!

153
00:15:32,472 --> 00:15:33,974
Oh, what a bugger.

154
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:39,116
Or as you might want to
say, what a fucking bugger.

155
00:15:39,118 --> 00:15:41,788
(laughing)

156
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:45,965
Oh well, looks like you're
stuck here for the night.

157
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,200
And if that's the case I for one

158
00:15:48,202 --> 00:15:50,672
would like to know your name.

159
00:15:50,674 --> 00:15:52,208
I'm Joyce.

160
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,046
Oh.

161
00:15:55,015 --> 00:15:56,484
I'm John.

162
00:15:56,486 --> 00:15:57,322
John?

163
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,993
That's a lovely name.

164
00:16:01,597 --> 00:16:02,931
Always liked it.

165
00:16:08,977 --> 00:16:11,215
It's nice to meet you John.

166
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:24,675
I'd also prefer more
candles if I can find any.

167
00:16:31,122 --> 00:16:33,626
(eerie chime)

168
00:17:11,068 --> 00:17:14,174
[John] So how far
from town are we?

169
00:17:25,564 --> 00:17:29,037
(comic country accent)
Ooh, many many miles, John.

170
00:17:30,005 --> 00:17:31,342
Many many miles.

171
00:17:32,478 --> 00:17:35,315
'Tis a very lonely
house you found here.

172
00:17:35,317 --> 00:17:39,458
Very lonely and very dark.

173
00:17:53,586 --> 00:17:55,956
(normal accent) I'd
say it was about 10, 11

174
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,062
miles to the village.

175
00:17:59,698 --> 00:18:03,205
Although, it's easy to go
round and round in circles

176
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:07,381
at night in the dark so you
could end up walking 20.

177
00:18:09,785 --> 00:18:11,254
I've been lost loads of times

178
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:14,996
walking out there in
the middle of the night.

179
00:18:16,832 --> 00:18:17,634
What?

180
00:18:19,071 --> 00:18:22,545
Why were you out walking
in the middle of the night?

181
00:18:23,313 --> 00:18:25,517
Well, you know.

182
00:18:29,993 --> 00:18:32,832
Well it's nice to
go walking at night.

183
00:18:33,433 --> 00:18:34,469
It's peaceful.

184
00:18:37,173 --> 00:18:41,081
There's lots of reasons
to go walking at night.

185
00:18:44,688 --> 00:18:46,191
Walking the dog?

186
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,594
They always need walking.

187
00:18:48,596 --> 00:18:51,301
That's enough reasons to go
walking at night, isn't it?

188
00:18:51,303 --> 00:18:52,736
Have you got a dog?

189
00:18:52,738 --> 00:18:54,139
No, of course I
haven't got a dog.

190
00:18:54,141 --> 00:18:55,544
Do you see a dog?

191
00:18:56,679 --> 00:18:58,447
I'm just saying that
if you had a dog

192
00:18:58,449 --> 00:19:01,020
it would need walking at night.

193
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:04,760
Besides I can walk
anywhere anytime.

194
00:19:04,762 --> 00:19:07,499
I don't need permission,
I am allowed.

195
00:19:07,501 --> 00:19:09,469
Young John with
the 20 questions.

196
00:19:09,471 --> 00:19:11,641
Huh, who's in charge here?

197
00:19:11,643 --> 00:19:15,514
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to upset you.

198
00:19:15,516 --> 00:19:18,620
I just think I may need a
doctor for my arm, that's all.

199
00:19:18,622 --> 00:19:21,494
Yes I know, your
arm, your arm.

200
00:19:21,496 --> 00:19:22,732
You poor thing.

201
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:32,918
I'm sorry.

202
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,026
It's so late and

203
00:19:38,563 --> 00:19:41,601
I've hardly slept with
this blooming weather and

204
00:19:41,603 --> 00:19:45,474
what with the lights
flickering on and off it's,

205
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:48,715
it's enough to drive anyone
up, up the wall, isn't it?

206
00:19:48,717 --> 00:19:50,386
You must be tired.

207
00:19:51,255 --> 00:19:54,026
Yes, I am very.

208
00:19:59,439 --> 00:20:01,574
Just have to make
the best of it.

209
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:03,312
Sit it out 'til morning.

210
00:20:25,122 --> 00:20:27,694
(wind howling)

211
00:20:32,871 --> 00:20:35,209
It looks freezing out there.

212
00:20:36,312 --> 00:20:38,114
Not much better in here.

213
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,051
(John chuckles)

214
00:20:41,889 --> 00:20:46,064
Used to love watching storms,
as a child, from the window.

215
00:20:47,734 --> 00:20:49,069
How old are you?

216
00:20:52,244 --> 00:20:56,385
When I was 11 there
was a storm, huge.

217
00:20:57,453 --> 00:20:58,289
Hellish.

218
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:01,226
I'm 19.

219
00:21:01,228 --> 00:21:05,201
No one would let me watch
it though, I was too little.

220
00:21:05,203 --> 00:21:08,674
Stay away from the window
girl, it's dangerous.

221
00:21:08,676 --> 00:21:10,244
They were all at the
bloody window though,

222
00:21:10,246 --> 00:21:13,251
both my parents and
my older brother.

223
00:21:13,253 --> 00:21:16,326
(creepy piano music)

224
00:21:22,537 --> 00:21:24,104
There was a massive
bolt of lightning

225
00:21:24,106 --> 00:21:26,279
and the window was struck.

226
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,386
My father was killed instantly

227
00:21:31,522 --> 00:21:33,693
and my mother lost an eye.

228
00:21:35,931 --> 00:21:39,437
My brother was cut
badly but nothing more.

229
00:21:43,546 --> 00:21:44,781
Hey, it's fine.

230
00:21:46,184 --> 00:21:49,490
My mother, she wears a pretty
diamante eye patch now.

231
00:21:49,492 --> 00:21:53,667
And my brother, well, he recovered
with only a few scars so.

232
00:21:56,239 --> 00:21:58,943
Oh, my father,

233
00:22:00,714 --> 00:22:02,215
didn't like him much anyway.

234
00:22:02,217 --> 00:22:03,620
So it's all good.

235
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:09,396
Now I can do what I like.

236
00:22:09,398 --> 00:22:12,968
I can watch any storm
I want from the window.

237
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,607
Though frankly there's
not much to see, is there?

238
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:18,880
Just a lot of leaves
blowing about.

239
00:22:18,882 --> 00:22:22,288
Don't know what
all the fuzz was.

240
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:25,530
Certainly not worth
losing an eye over.

241
00:22:27,234 --> 00:22:28,068
Still.

242
00:22:38,456 --> 00:22:41,026
(wind howling)

243
00:23:16,164 --> 00:23:20,139
So, what am I gonna do with you?

244
00:23:22,243 --> 00:23:23,078
John.

245
00:23:26,284 --> 00:23:30,460
I mean, what can we do
to while away the hours

246
00:23:31,194 --> 00:23:32,731
on this long dark night?

247
00:23:35,469 --> 00:23:36,304
Any ideas?

248
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,144
John?

249
00:23:41,249 --> 00:23:42,917
What do you mean?

250
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,792
Look, I'm only 19.

251
00:23:49,498 --> 00:23:53,203
You're okay looking, you're
really pretty for your age

252
00:23:53,205 --> 00:23:55,340
but you're just so
much older than me.

253
00:23:55,342 --> 00:23:56,843
What are you
blithering on about?

254
00:23:56,845 --> 00:23:58,346
I just think you're
a bit too old for me.

255
00:23:58,348 --> 00:23:59,416
And my arm really hurts.

256
00:23:59,418 --> 00:24:00,253
What?

257
00:24:02,657 --> 00:24:04,827
I'm not interested in you!

258
00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:06,130
(laughing)

259
00:24:06,998 --> 00:24:08,936
Goodness, that's hilarious!

260
00:24:09,672 --> 00:24:11,106
I'm not Mrs. Robinson.

261
00:24:13,713 --> 00:24:17,888
Oh, you've not idea who
I'm talking about, do you?

262
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:21,426
She's what you might
call the ultimate cougar.

263
00:24:21,428 --> 00:24:22,663
Which I am not.

264
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:25,635
The very idea.

265
00:24:25,637 --> 00:24:27,137
(laughing)

266
00:24:27,139 --> 00:24:28,908
Besides, you need to have
two fully workable arms

267
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:31,547
to have any chance with me.

268
00:24:31,549 --> 00:24:32,384
Oh gosh.

269
00:24:33,218 --> 00:24:34,285
(laughing)

270
00:24:34,287 --> 00:24:36,524
You've made me all coy now.

271
00:24:37,426 --> 00:24:39,762
You're so naughty.

272
00:24:39,764 --> 00:24:41,935
(giggles)

273
00:24:56,163 --> 00:24:58,336
(giggles)

274
00:24:59,605 --> 00:25:01,575
He's young enough to be...

275
00:26:39,169 --> 00:26:41,208
Oh, look what I found.

276
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:45,381
Monopoly, Scrabble,
even a jigsaw.

277
00:26:45,383 --> 00:26:48,587
Although, I hate jigsaws, don't
know why I brought that out.

278
00:26:48,589 --> 00:26:50,760
Keep us occupied for days.

279
00:27:11,066 --> 00:27:13,137
I'm pretty thawed out.

280
00:27:14,608 --> 00:27:17,880
Bit warmer at least, might
be able to get going soon.

281
00:27:18,615 --> 00:27:19,750
What do you think?

282
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,723
Perhaps you could
give me directions.

283
00:27:23,459 --> 00:27:25,263
For goodness sake.

284
00:27:25,996 --> 00:27:26,996
What's the rush John?

285
00:27:26,998 --> 00:27:28,199
I'm not going to jump on you.

286
00:27:28,201 --> 00:27:30,873
I thought we'd established that.

287
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:38,389
Ugh, there's no dog.

288
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:41,295
I'm always the dog.

289
00:28:00,266 --> 00:28:02,437
(grunting)

290
00:28:04,573 --> 00:28:06,911
Okay okay, your arm, I know.

291
00:28:09,617 --> 00:28:12,789
I'll drive you to the
village once it gets light.

292
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:15,660
As soon as my husband
gets back in the...

293
00:28:15,662 --> 00:28:16,898
in the...

294
00:28:24,481 --> 00:28:25,583
[Man] How you feeling?

295
00:28:26,785 --> 00:28:29,123
[Joyce] Good, I'm
feeling really good.

296
00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:31,559
When is he back?

297
00:28:31,561 --> 00:28:32,729
Morning is it?

298
00:28:35,769 --> 00:28:39,109
Yes the morning, of
course, silly woman.

299
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,385
Maybe it's the
afternoon he's back?

300
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:51,234
I'm sure he wasn't
going to go for long.

301
00:28:52,971 --> 00:28:57,146
I mean, he didn't pack very
much, hardly anything at all.

302
00:29:02,857 --> 00:29:05,660
He should have told me though.

303
00:29:05,662 --> 00:29:07,499
Let me know, you know.

304
00:29:12,976 --> 00:29:15,549
He'll be back, don't you worry.

305
00:29:16,751 --> 00:29:18,687
Anyway, whenever he's
back I'll take the car

306
00:29:18,689 --> 00:29:22,864
and you'll be returned to
civilization, how's that?

307
00:29:24,567 --> 00:29:25,402
Great.

308
00:29:41,435 --> 00:29:43,839
Nice that you have a husband.

309
00:29:47,247 --> 00:29:49,351
The man in the photo.

310
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:55,260
Yes he's my husband,
we're married,

311
00:29:55,262 --> 00:29:57,532
we're very happily married.

312
00:29:58,134 --> 00:29:59,069
I'm sure.

313
00:30:00,805 --> 00:30:02,977
Oh you're sure, are you?

314
00:30:04,314 --> 00:30:06,783
(mocking) Nice that
you have a husband.

315
00:30:06,785 --> 00:30:08,520
Just glad you're
not out here alone.

316
00:30:08,522 --> 00:30:10,024
Alone, out here?

317
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:14,298
How silly.

318
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,134
Alone?

319
00:30:16,838 --> 00:30:18,540
And besides I'm not
the one running around

320
00:30:18,542 --> 00:30:20,646
in the middle of a forest
with a bloody broken arm.

321
00:30:21,247 --> 00:30:22,447
Am I John?

322
00:30:22,449 --> 00:30:24,320
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to upset you.

323
00:30:32,569 --> 00:30:35,074
Have you got any pain killers?

324
00:30:40,285 --> 00:30:42,554
Well, as you're in such pain,

325
00:30:42,556 --> 00:30:46,732
I'll see if I can find anything
in my cupboards for it.

326
00:30:53,878 --> 00:30:55,715
(muttering) I don't want to.

327
00:30:57,786 --> 00:30:59,790
I'll just look in there.

328
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:02,296
I'm not going to talk about it.

329
00:31:03,565 --> 00:31:06,338
(pills rattling)

330
00:31:12,849 --> 00:31:14,152
(ghostly whispers)

331
00:31:15,021 --> 00:31:16,792
Yes I know, I know, I do.

332
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,799
That's right, I
do have a husband.

333
00:31:24,607 --> 00:31:26,542
He's just trying to
make me feel stupid

334
00:31:26,544 --> 00:31:28,981
I wouldn't be out here alone.

335
00:31:35,963 --> 00:31:38,468
(floor boards creaking)

336
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:45,248
(floor boards creaking)

337
00:31:54,868 --> 00:31:56,503
Here's your pain killers.

338
00:31:56,505 --> 00:31:57,573
Oh, thanks.

339
00:32:18,548 --> 00:32:21,017
Uh, can we light the fire?

340
00:32:21,019 --> 00:32:23,623
Uh, stupid, there's no power.

341
00:32:23,625 --> 00:32:25,563
But it's a real fire.

342
00:32:37,486 --> 00:32:40,425
(ghostly whispers)

343
00:32:48,407 --> 00:32:49,476
Need a light?

344
00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:52,147
[Joyce] Thank you.

345
00:33:09,081 --> 00:33:10,952
[John] You okay?

346
00:33:11,687 --> 00:33:13,457
Yeah I'm fine, thanks.

347
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:28,954
Here.

348
00:33:32,796 --> 00:33:35,635
Oh, the flame's
getting quite big.

349
00:33:41,414 --> 00:33:42,747
Think that looks all right?

350
00:33:42,749 --> 00:33:45,821
Not gonna set the house on fire?

351
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:48,960
I don't think, don't
think poking is gonna...

352
00:33:48,962 --> 00:33:50,631
I'm not poking it!

353
00:33:54,507 --> 00:33:55,439
Don't poke it!

354
00:33:55,441 --> 00:33:57,645
I'm not going to poke it!

355
00:34:02,523 --> 00:34:05,195
See, told you I'm not poking it.

356
00:34:10,773 --> 00:34:12,508
There, what do you think?

357
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,612
That looks all
right, doesn't it?

358
00:34:14,614 --> 00:34:16,884
Yeah yeah, it looks fine.

359
00:34:33,984 --> 00:34:37,758
That's gonna take
a while, isn't it?

360
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,161
Oh, I am sorry.

361
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,605
I'll see if I can't find you
a hot water bottle, shall I?

362
00:34:44,607 --> 00:34:47,042
Or an electric blanket perhaps?

363
00:34:47,044 --> 00:34:50,783
But then there's no power
so that won't work, will it?

364
00:34:50,785 --> 00:34:52,521
Obviously missed the telegram.

365
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:53,723
Sorry.

366
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:54,657
I mean, if I'd
know you were coming

367
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,228
I'd have had the west wing aired

368
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,766
and I wouldn't have given
the staff the night off!

369
00:34:58,768 --> 00:35:01,006
(table rattling)

370
00:35:05,882 --> 00:35:07,384
Miserable little fucker!

371
00:35:07,386 --> 00:35:09,019
Fucking warn him!

372
00:35:09,021 --> 00:35:11,391
(ghostly whispers)

373
00:35:11,393 --> 00:35:13,731
One, two, three, four, five.

374
00:35:14,766 --> 00:35:16,436
Be nice, I've got to be nice.

375
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:18,173
I'm sick of being nice!

376
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:21,547
Six, seven, eight, nine.

377
00:35:22,883 --> 00:35:25,822
(rattling drawers)

378
00:35:28,394 --> 00:35:29,229
Ah.

379
00:35:38,748 --> 00:35:41,552
I'm really sorry for
being a misery guts.

380
00:35:41,554 --> 00:35:45,460
It's just the electric being
out is really getting to me.

381
00:35:45,462 --> 00:35:48,200
Anyway, let me
make it up to you.

382
00:35:57,085 --> 00:35:58,353
Look what I've got.

383
00:35:58,355 --> 00:36:00,088
(quacking)

384
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:02,328
(laughing)

385
00:36:05,835 --> 00:36:07,068
Ah!

386
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,507
Oops, my fault.

387
00:36:09,977 --> 00:36:12,483
I hate board games, don't you?

388
00:36:15,521 --> 00:36:19,028
I couldn't find any
glasses so mugs it is.

389
00:36:21,133 --> 00:36:23,971
But it all goes
down the same way.

390
00:36:31,453 --> 00:36:32,755
Just the ticket.

391
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,797
This will warm us up.

392
00:36:38,234 --> 00:36:40,238
Who needs a bloody fire?

393
00:36:47,218 --> 00:36:49,489
(coughing)

394
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:54,533
How cosy is this?

395
00:37:07,926 --> 00:37:10,329
Where are you from John?

396
00:37:10,331 --> 00:37:12,835
Do you live with your parents?

397
00:37:14,205 --> 00:37:17,980
Don't you think they'll
be worried about you?

398
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,994
A long way away.

399
00:37:30,538 --> 00:37:33,142
What's your mother like John?

400
00:37:35,447 --> 00:37:38,720
Actually she's,
she's a lot like you.

401
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,331
I've not seen her
in a very long time.

402
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:48,340
Must be seven or nearly
eight, eight years now.

403
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:52,614
She sent me away.

404
00:37:52,616 --> 00:37:53,450
Why?

405
00:37:57,893 --> 00:37:59,330
Had you been bad?

406
00:38:01,701 --> 00:38:04,740
You can tell me, I
can keep a secret.

407
00:38:06,943 --> 00:38:10,551
Here, maybe this will
help you to remember.

408
00:38:20,771 --> 00:38:24,011
What could have made
her send you away?

409
00:38:25,214 --> 00:38:28,052
What did you do to
make her do that?

410
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:32,696
(eerie music)

411
00:38:43,183 --> 00:38:44,084
Look at us.

412
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:51,031
Open fire, brandy, blankets,
cabin in the woods.

413
00:38:55,407 --> 00:38:57,010
Miles from nowhere.

414
00:39:01,086 --> 00:39:02,622
Almost like family.

415
00:39:06,996 --> 00:39:09,436
All right, like friends then.

416
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,140
It's a bit like that film.

417
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,643
What's it called?

418
00:39:14,645 --> 00:39:16,148
Uh, flippin' heck.

419
00:39:17,618 --> 00:39:21,726
You know it, you do, that
classic film, the horror.

420
00:39:23,063 --> 00:39:25,700
All those kids getting
murdered one after the other.

421
00:39:25,702 --> 00:39:26,668
Cabin in the Woods.

422
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,171
Cabin in the Woods?

423
00:39:28,173 --> 00:39:29,407
That's not even a film.

424
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:30,676
Yes it is.

425
00:39:30,678 --> 00:39:32,913
Well I've never heard of it.

426
00:39:32,915 --> 00:39:34,919
No, there was a black lake.

427
00:39:36,724 --> 00:39:39,694
Michael, Michael Myers was it?

428
00:39:39,696 --> 00:39:41,866
Justin, Jas...?

429
00:39:42,469 --> 00:39:43,703
Friday the 13th!

430
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,710
Told you I knew it!

431
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:49,450
Blooming Cottage in the Woods.

432
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,082
(laughing)

433
00:39:51,084 --> 00:39:52,421
Friday the 13th.

434
00:39:54,025 --> 00:39:56,029
That was about a mother.

435
00:40:01,139 --> 00:40:02,909
Drink up mystery man.

436
00:40:04,612 --> 00:40:06,183
What do you mean?

437
00:40:08,587 --> 00:40:10,556
Well, you've come
here out of nowhere

438
00:40:10,558 --> 00:40:13,464
and I don't even
know your surname.

439
00:40:17,171 --> 00:40:19,843
Um, I assume you have a surname.

440
00:40:25,787 --> 00:40:27,056
Are you hungry?

441
00:40:30,063 --> 00:40:33,002
I'm gonna see what's
in the fridge.

442
00:40:36,209 --> 00:40:37,812
(ghostly whispers)

443
00:40:39,014 --> 00:40:41,018
Calm down, it's not him.

444
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:46,028
Six, seven, eight, nine.

445
00:40:47,398 --> 00:40:49,467
(ghostly whispers)

446
00:40:49,469 --> 00:40:51,473
Everything will be fine.

447
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,545
(ghostly whispers)

448
00:41:53,196 --> 00:41:54,799
(ghostly whispers)

449
00:41:57,036 --> 00:42:00,042
I know. I'm in control.

450
00:42:05,287 --> 00:42:07,623
(ghostly whispers)

451
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:09,728
(zapping)

452
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:12,836
[Ghostly Voiceover]
I'm in control.

453
00:42:42,795 --> 00:42:45,300
(eerie music)

454
00:44:04,526 --> 00:44:08,063
Found a block of cheese
and some mayo in the fridge.

455
00:44:08,065 --> 00:44:11,671
Think it's brown bread but it's
hard to tell in this light.

456
00:44:11,673 --> 00:44:13,274
All fresh though and chilled.

457
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:16,014
So the electric can't have
been off for very long.

458
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:20,123
Funny the... fridge light.

459
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:23,228
(ghostly whispers)

460
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:25,965
[John] Don't you know how
long the power's been off?

461
00:44:25,967 --> 00:44:27,435
What?

462
00:44:27,437 --> 00:44:29,574
You said you didn't know
how long the power's been off.

463
00:44:29,576 --> 00:44:32,482
Didn't you notice
when it went off?

464
00:44:34,151 --> 00:44:35,821
No, didn't notice.

465
00:44:36,823 --> 00:44:37,657
Okay.

466
00:44:39,762 --> 00:44:42,434
Well, I've been out haven't I?

467
00:44:43,302 --> 00:44:45,605
What, in the cold?

468
00:44:45,607 --> 00:44:48,076
You said I was mad
being out in this.

469
00:44:48,078 --> 00:44:49,848
Yes, I've been out.

470
00:44:51,819 --> 00:44:54,324
Perhaps I was walking the dog.

471
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,671
Hmm, nice cheese sandwich.

472
00:45:06,316 --> 00:45:08,821
Drink up before it evaporates.

473
00:45:09,856 --> 00:45:12,124
I think I've had enough.

474
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,630
Listen, you look like I feel.

475
00:45:14,632 --> 00:45:17,000
And you need to sleep.

476
00:45:17,002 --> 00:45:20,443
It'll help you sleep so
don't waste it, drink it.

477
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:24,352
I'm going to bed now anyway.

478
00:45:25,788 --> 00:45:28,894
Squinting at you through the
dark is giving me a headache.

479
00:45:30,095 --> 00:45:31,699
And I wouldn't sleep
there if I were you.

480
00:45:32,567 --> 00:45:34,035
Not with your arm as it is.

481
00:45:34,037 --> 00:45:35,738
Sleep in the spare bed
and get your strength back

482
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:37,809
ready to leave first
thing in the morning.

483
00:45:37,811 --> 00:45:39,111
How's that sound?

484
00:45:39,113 --> 00:45:40,682
Great, thanks.

485
00:45:40,684 --> 00:45:44,557
The bedrooms are through
there and up the stairs.

486
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:46,193
My one is the first
one on the left

487
00:45:46,195 --> 00:45:48,298
and you're right next door.

488
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:49,799
All good?

489
00:45:49,801 --> 00:45:51,068
Mmhm.

490
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:54,779
Okay, well, then I'll
bid you goodnight John.

491
00:45:57,049 --> 00:45:59,721
What name should I put on
the bill for your room?

492
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,628
(laughing)

493
00:46:03,397 --> 00:46:04,499
Um, Simons.

494
00:46:09,676 --> 00:46:10,511
Okay.

495
00:46:12,415 --> 00:46:15,287
Night night, John Simons.

496
00:46:22,167 --> 00:46:24,938
(door latch rattling)

497
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:39,335
(eerie music)

498
00:46:49,988 --> 00:46:52,894
You see, I knew it
is, I was right.

499
00:46:57,069 --> 00:46:58,072
Oh no no no.

500
00:46:59,006 --> 00:47:00,777
Oh, don't let it disappear.

501
00:47:02,648 --> 00:47:04,084
I knew who he was.

502
00:47:15,306 --> 00:47:16,709
Now it's gone.

503
00:47:19,982 --> 00:47:22,387
I remembered something.

504
00:47:23,557 --> 00:47:26,060
(eerie music)

505
00:47:45,968 --> 00:47:50,142
That's mean, that's mean
taking it away like that.

506
00:48:06,442 --> 00:48:09,046
(wind howling)

507
00:48:28,986 --> 00:48:30,788
[Joyce] What's your
mother like John?

508
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:32,526
[John] I've not seen
her in a very long time.

509
00:48:32,528 --> 00:48:33,630
[Joyce] Do I know you?

510
00:48:34,231 --> 00:48:34,532
[John] John.

511
00:48:35,266 --> 00:48:35,766
[Joyce] Lovely name.

512
00:48:36,369 --> 00:48:38,539
(eerie music)

513
00:48:39,274 --> 00:48:40,476
He's a test, isn't he?

514
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:44,784
(eerie music)

515
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:26,436
(footsteps approaching)

516
00:49:35,687 --> 00:49:38,193
(eerie music)

517
00:50:07,082 --> 00:50:09,019
(floorboards creaking)

518
00:51:11,312 --> 00:51:13,582
(grunting)

519
00:52:38,151 --> 00:52:39,655
[Joyce] How sad.

520
00:52:50,275 --> 00:52:53,515
(dramatic piano music)

521
00:53:35,132 --> 00:53:38,206
(suspenseful music)

522
00:53:57,811 --> 00:54:00,582
(soft breathing)

523
00:54:11,338 --> 00:54:14,010
(soft groaning)

524
00:55:25,018 --> 00:55:29,193
(birds chirping)
(laughing)

525
00:55:30,797 --> 00:55:33,536
[Ghostly Voiceover]
Now, do you see?

526
00:55:46,594 --> 00:55:50,769
(rapid breathing)
(eerie music)

527
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:04,362
[Joyce Voiceover]
Please, I will get better,

528
00:56:04,364 --> 00:56:06,433
I'll take my pills I promise.

529
00:56:06,435 --> 00:56:07,267
(gun shot)

530
00:56:07,269 --> 00:56:09,607
(screaming)

531
00:56:21,698 --> 00:56:23,935
(grunting)

532
00:57:34,343 --> 00:57:35,779
Can't he stay?

533
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:02,333
(door locks rattling)

534
00:58:03,568 --> 00:58:04,370
No, no!

535
00:58:06,308 --> 00:58:08,310
(ghost laughing)

536
00:58:08,312 --> 00:58:09,814
(ghostly whispers)

537
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:21,036
(grunting)

538
00:58:47,154 --> 00:58:48,189
Stretching your legs?

539
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:50,795
I just needed some fresh air.

540
00:58:52,065 --> 00:58:53,333
Can I?

541
00:58:53,335 --> 00:58:55,471
I was just keeping
us warm, by the way.

542
00:58:55,473 --> 00:58:56,740
Last night when I
got into bed with you

543
00:58:56,742 --> 00:58:58,844
I was just keeping us warm.

544
00:58:58,846 --> 00:59:00,547
It was nothing dirty.

545
00:59:00,549 --> 00:59:01,651
Okay Joyce.

546
00:59:03,287 --> 00:59:04,323
Okay Joyce?

547
00:59:19,152 --> 00:59:22,325
See anything
interesting, in the shed?

548
00:59:23,762 --> 00:59:26,832
Why do children always sneak
around poking their noses?

549
00:59:26,834 --> 00:59:28,303
I'm not a child anymore Joyce.

550
00:59:28,305 --> 00:59:29,407
Is that so?

551
00:59:30,309 --> 00:59:31,542
I just wanted to see...

552
00:59:31,544 --> 00:59:35,585
To see, if I had
a car, a bicycle

553
00:59:36,554 --> 00:59:38,190
four elephants and a drum kit?

554
00:59:38,192 --> 00:59:40,696
Tell me, what were
you wanting to see?

555
00:59:41,298 --> 00:59:42,733
Please, Joyce.

556
00:59:44,135 --> 00:59:46,238
Mrs. Hadley, I think I'd
like to be called from now on.

557
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,775
Thank you

558
00:59:47,777 --> 00:59:51,348
Joyce is too familiar
and you don't know me.

559
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:53,621
Please Mrs. Hadley, try it.

560
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:58,062
Please Mrs. Hadley.

561
00:59:58,064 --> 00:59:59,365
Thank you.

562
00:59:59,367 --> 01:00:02,070
Now, what is it that
you'd like to ask me?

563
01:00:02,072 --> 01:00:03,606
I'd like to ask...

564
01:00:03,608 --> 01:00:05,844
No, John, I think you'd
like to tell me something.

565
01:00:05,846 --> 01:00:06,680
Correct?

566
01:00:07,583 --> 01:00:08,550
Tell you?

567
01:00:08,552 --> 01:00:10,222
Yes John, tell me.

568
01:00:13,027 --> 01:00:15,696
Let's start with the
backpack, shall we?

569
01:00:15,698 --> 01:00:16,866
For instance, why it
never leaves your side

570
01:00:16,868 --> 01:00:18,705
not even for a moment.

571
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:22,911
Although, that's not
strictly true is it?

572
01:00:22,913 --> 01:00:24,881
You didn't notice it
disappear for 10 minutes

573
01:00:24,883 --> 01:00:26,018
while you asleep, did you?

574
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:28,356
You've been through my things?

575
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:32,398
No John, I haven't
been through your things

576
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,235
because none of what
is in that backpack

577
01:00:34,237 --> 01:00:36,104
belongs to you, does it?

578
01:00:36,106 --> 01:00:39,311
Unless you've lost a few
pound, gained a small child

579
01:00:39,313 --> 01:00:42,850
and look incredibly
young for 43.

580
01:00:42,852 --> 01:00:45,590
I didn't steal it if
that's what you think.

581
01:00:45,592 --> 01:00:47,162
Whose is it John?

582
01:00:48,365 --> 01:00:52,038
Who does it belong to
and how did you get it?

583
01:00:56,982 --> 01:01:01,156
You can stop this Joyce, you
need to open your eyes now.

584
01:01:06,668 --> 01:01:08,338
Look at the picture.

585
01:01:11,343 --> 01:01:14,616
(ghostlike whispering)

586
01:01:19,827 --> 01:01:21,664
[Joyce] Having trouble?

587
01:01:22,399 --> 01:01:23,565
Let me go Joyce,

588
01:01:23,567 --> 01:01:26,372
you don't wanna go
through all this again.

589
01:01:26,374 --> 01:01:27,975
Where d'you wanna go John?

590
01:01:27,977 --> 01:01:29,779
Let me leave Joyce.

591
01:01:29,781 --> 01:01:31,482
Open this door
for your own sake.

592
01:01:31,484 --> 01:01:33,252
Now, what sort of
person would I be

593
01:01:33,254 --> 01:01:34,889
if I simply let a
lying little thief

594
01:01:34,891 --> 01:01:36,426
loose into the community?

595
01:01:36,428 --> 01:01:37,927
[John] What?

596
01:01:37,929 --> 01:01:41,268
I mean, I'd feel so guilty
just letting you walk out.

597
01:01:41,270 --> 01:01:42,135
(smack)

598
01:01:42,137 --> 01:01:43,004
(grunting)

599
01:01:43,006 --> 01:01:44,174
Don't do this Joyce!

600
01:01:44,177 --> 01:01:45,142
[Joyce] What if you run off?

601
01:01:45,144 --> 01:01:45,877
(smack)
(grunting)

602
01:01:45,879 --> 01:01:46,812
Joyce!

603
01:01:46,814 --> 01:01:48,015
Or steal someone's passport?

604
01:01:48,017 --> 01:01:48,849
(smack)
(grunting)

605
01:01:48,851 --> 01:01:50,018
Or savings?

606
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:51,054
[John] Joyce, remember!

607
01:01:51,056 --> 01:01:53,327
It's Mrs. Fucking Hadley!

608
01:01:54,996 --> 01:01:57,867
[Ghostlike Voiceover] Get him!

609
01:01:57,869 --> 01:02:01,275
(door rattling)

610
01:02:01,277 --> 01:02:02,680
Open this door!

611
01:02:04,081 --> 01:02:05,986
Open this fucking door!

612
01:02:09,861 --> 01:02:12,766
(ghostly whispers)

613
01:02:14,370 --> 01:02:15,939
I'm done being calm.

614
01:02:17,809 --> 01:02:20,079
He wants to leave.

615
01:02:20,081 --> 01:02:22,586
Why does everyone wanna leave?

616
01:02:25,057 --> 01:02:29,232
[Ghostly Voiceover] Because
nobody could love you.

617
01:02:36,112 --> 01:02:40,288
(tree felling)
(birds chirping)

618
01:02:47,236 --> 01:02:50,509
(ghostlike grunting)

619
01:02:55,116 --> 01:02:58,123
(doorknob rattling)

620
01:03:00,161 --> 01:03:01,864
(door squeaking)

621
01:03:03,634 --> 01:03:05,502
(heavy breathing)

622
01:03:05,504 --> 01:03:07,742
(inhaling)

623
01:03:16,361 --> 01:03:18,431
Remember the gun Joyce.

624
01:03:19,467 --> 01:03:21,268
Remember what it did.

625
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:24,807
Oh my God, don't
shoot me please John.

626
01:03:24,809 --> 01:03:26,778
You need to let me go.

627
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:28,882
Please don't kill
me, I don't wanna die.

628
01:03:28,884 --> 01:03:30,786
I'm so sorry, please.

629
01:03:30,788 --> 01:03:32,859
(crying)

630
01:03:39,373 --> 01:03:41,611
(laughing)

631
01:03:48,122 --> 01:03:51,062
(bullets rattling)

632
01:03:52,498 --> 01:03:56,339
Unless you're gonna club me
to death with the handle.

633
01:03:56,341 --> 01:04:00,515
But then, you're forgetting,
I'm still holding the poker.

634
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,871
(door rattling)

635
01:04:13,742 --> 01:04:15,044
There's nowhere to go John.

636
01:04:16,481 --> 01:04:18,351
Everywhere is locked, you
should know that by now.

637
01:04:19,754 --> 01:04:21,857
[Ghostly Voiceover] That's
it, show him who's boss.

638
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,730
(electrical buzzing)

639
01:04:44,737 --> 01:04:46,071
That's better.

640
01:04:47,508 --> 01:04:50,816
[Ghostly Voiceover] See,
you're in control. You are.

641
01:05:00,902 --> 01:05:04,176
[John] You don't need
to do this to me Joyce.

642
01:05:05,512 --> 01:05:08,750
Think about what's
happening, change things.

643
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,523
[Ghostly Voiceover]
Don't listen to him.

644
01:05:12,123 --> 01:05:13,328
[John] Joyce!

645
01:05:13,927 --> 01:05:14,796
Mrs. Hadley!

646
01:05:15,699 --> 01:05:17,436
[John] Mrs. Hadley.

647
01:05:18,470 --> 01:05:22,111
(electrical buzzing)
(groaning)

648
01:05:23,515 --> 01:05:24,213
[Joyce Voiceover] You're
mommy's little darling

649
01:05:24,215 --> 01:05:25,049
aren't you?

650
01:05:25,919 --> 01:05:27,686
[John] I'm sorry, okay.

651
01:05:27,688 --> 01:05:31,363
Whatever it is I've
done, I'm sorry, please.

652
01:05:32,798 --> 01:05:35,802
Whatever it is you've done?

653
01:05:35,804 --> 01:05:38,478
Whatever it is that you've done?

654
01:05:39,946 --> 01:05:44,121
You steal my husband's bag,
his money, his passport,

655
01:05:44,989 --> 01:05:46,824
then you break into my house.

656
01:05:46,826 --> 01:05:48,529
[John] I didn't.

657
01:05:48,531 --> 01:05:51,969
The last couple of times I
was too young to make you see.

658
01:05:51,971 --> 01:05:55,108
But this time,
remember who I am!

659
01:05:55,110 --> 01:05:57,048
You took him from me.

660
01:05:57,915 --> 01:05:59,419
That's it Joyce.

661
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:02,824
You're remembering.

662
01:06:02,826 --> 01:06:04,728
And now you want
to shoot me too!

663
01:06:04,730 --> 01:06:07,733
[John] No, that's
not what's happened.

664
01:06:07,735 --> 01:06:09,771
Well I'm going
to defend myself.

665
01:06:09,773 --> 01:06:12,611
And no one is going
to blame me for it.

666
01:06:12,613 --> 01:06:14,950
No one will blame me at all!

667
01:06:17,955 --> 01:06:20,561
(electrical buzzing)

668
01:06:21,696 --> 01:06:23,967
[Joyce Voiceover] Get
that out of my face!

669
01:06:24,569 --> 01:06:26,873
(whimpering)

670
01:06:28,211 --> 01:06:32,385
Please, I need
you to understand.

671
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:34,854
(electrical buzzing)

672
01:06:34,856 --> 01:06:36,123
[Joyce Voiceover]
That's enough!

673
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:38,561
Get out of my sight,
stupid little shit!

674
01:06:38,563 --> 01:06:40,834
(gun bang)

675
01:06:42,406 --> 01:06:43,874
(heavy breathing)

676
01:06:45,044 --> 01:06:46,146
[Ghostly Voiceover]
Don't believe his lies.

677
01:06:52,224 --> 01:06:54,860
I'm going to punish you John.

678
01:06:54,862 --> 01:06:56,433
You know I have to.

679
01:06:57,868 --> 01:07:00,308
(grunting)

680
01:07:01,276 --> 01:07:03,145
(footsteps receding)

(suspenseful music)

Where the hell is he?

01:07:28,964 --> 01:07:30,434
(grunting)

684
01:07:33,106 --> 01:07:36,112
(doorknob rattling)

685
01:07:38,015 --> 01:07:41,119
You better not be
trying to leave.

686
01:07:41,121 --> 01:07:43,226
I know what you're doing.

687
01:07:45,864 --> 01:07:47,599
(hurried footsteps)

688
01:07:47,601 --> 01:07:50,608
(suspenseful music)

689
01:07:57,988 --> 01:08:01,361
Better watch that drop John,
you might break the other arm.

690
01:08:01,363 --> 01:08:04,336
(suspenseful music)

691
01:08:09,879 --> 01:08:11,282
[Ghostly Voiceover]
Christ sake's, calm down.

692
01:08:11,884 --> 01:08:12,385
I am calm!

693
01:08:18,062 --> 01:08:21,100
Joyce, I don't
think I can stop this.

694
01:08:21,102 --> 01:08:22,237
(grunting)

695
01:08:22,239 --> 01:08:25,244
(suspenseful music)

696
01:08:31,656 --> 01:08:33,225
You don't have to do this Joyce.

697
01:08:33,227 --> 01:08:34,460
There's still time to stop.

698
01:08:34,462 --> 01:08:35,464
Stop what?

699
01:08:37,268 --> 01:08:39,136
Who am I, say my name.

700
01:08:39,138 --> 01:08:39,970
You're John.

701
01:08:39,972 --> 01:08:41,374
I'm your John.

702
01:08:41,376 --> 01:08:42,976
- [Ghostly Voice] He's lying.
- No!

703
01:08:42,978 --> 01:08:45,248
My John was 10 years old.

704
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:48,156
My John was a
conniving little boy.

705
01:08:49,592 --> 01:08:52,863
He made my husband hate
me, took him away from me.

706
01:08:52,865 --> 01:08:57,006
My John was a naughty,
spoiled little shit!

707
01:08:59,579 --> 01:09:01,247
[Joyce Voiceover]
Go to your room!

708
01:09:01,249 --> 01:09:03,351
No, I was just a little boy.

709
01:09:03,353 --> 01:09:06,857
A normal little boy,
me nine years ago.

710
01:09:06,859 --> 01:09:08,695
(electrical buzzing)
(moaning)

711
01:09:08,697 --> 01:09:12,436
You can make this right,
please, let me leave.

712
01:09:12,438 --> 01:09:14,607
I can't, don't you understand?

713
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:17,579
It's the only thing
that stops the pain!

714
01:09:17,581 --> 01:09:20,318
Let the pain in,
go through the pain.

715
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,556
We can go through it together.

716
01:09:22,558 --> 01:09:26,666
It's hurts too
much, I'm too scared.

717
01:09:27,134 --> 01:09:29,138
(crying)

718
01:09:30,575 --> 01:09:32,410
You have to be punished!

719
01:09:32,412 --> 01:09:33,711
It's the way it is.

720
01:09:33,713 --> 01:09:35,382
It's the way it has to be.

721
01:09:35,384 --> 01:09:37,018
[Ghostly Voiceover]
Time's up Joyce.

722
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:38,121
Do it.

723
01:09:38,123 --> 01:09:39,125
I'm sorry.

724
01:09:40,394 --> 01:09:41,660
[Ghostly Voiceover] Do it.

725
01:09:41,662 --> 01:09:43,933
(grunting)

726
01:09:49,946 --> 01:09:54,121
(crying)
(laughing)

727
01:10:09,118 --> 01:10:09,953
Hey.

728
01:10:11,889 --> 01:10:14,693
Yes, I can scrub up, can't I?

729
01:10:14,695 --> 01:10:16,199
What do you think?

730
01:10:22,278 --> 01:10:23,545
Too much?

731
01:10:23,547 --> 01:10:25,615
It's the lipstick isn't it?

732
01:10:25,617 --> 01:10:26,550
Or is it the hair?

733
01:10:26,552 --> 01:10:29,088
You prefer it down, don't you?

734
01:10:29,090 --> 01:10:30,758
Hey, I'm talking to you.

735
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:32,698
I need to look my best.

736
01:10:34,336 --> 01:10:35,335
Your best?

737
01:10:35,337 --> 01:10:37,373
Yes, I want to
look just right.

738
01:10:37,375 --> 01:10:39,212
Why am I still here?

739
01:10:41,415 --> 01:10:44,353
My husband is on his way
back, I want you to meet him.

740
01:10:44,355 --> 01:10:46,390
But he's dead.

741
01:10:46,392 --> 01:10:49,264
No, he's not, he's
coming home to me.

742
01:10:49,266 --> 01:10:51,767
Your husband is
dead, dad is dead.

743
01:10:51,769 --> 01:10:53,572
No, no, no, no, no.

744
01:10:53,574 --> 01:10:55,208
He's coming here, he
always comes here.

745
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:56,578
You've just never seen him.

746
01:10:56,580 --> 01:10:58,383
You're not listening to me!

747
01:10:59,852 --> 01:11:03,393
You didn't hit me as hard
as you could have did you?

748
01:11:05,398 --> 01:11:07,265
You held back.

749
01:11:07,267 --> 01:11:08,502
Why Joyce?

750
01:11:08,504 --> 01:11:10,839
Stop, I don't
want you to talk.

751

Tell me Joyce, why
did you hold back?

752
01:11:12,712 --> 01:11:14,280
Stop talking!

753
01:11:14,282 --> 01:11:16,083
I still have a choice,
it's still up to me

754
01:11:16,085 --> 01:11:17,720
so just shut up.

755
01:11:17,722 --> 01:11:19,757
(chuckles)

756
01:11:19,759 --> 01:11:21,125
You said your
husband is coming.

757
01:11:21,127 --> 01:11:22,596
What time is he arriving?

758
01:11:22,598 --> 01:11:24,834
Oh, what time is he arriving,
why don't you ever shut up?

01:11:24,836 --> 01:11:27,038
(chuckle)

What time is he arriving?

761
01:11:30,248 --> 01:11:31,681
What time is he arriving?

762
01:11:31,683 --> 01:11:32,516
[John] What time?

763
01:11:32,518 --> 01:11:33,352
Is he arriving.

764
01:11:33,354 --> 01:11:34,519
I know, I heard you.

765
01:11:34,521 --> 01:11:35,788
Why do you want to
know, what's it to you?

766
01:11:35,790 --> 01:11:37,795
Oh I just wanna
know who's coming.

767
01:11:38,396 --> 01:11:38,930
You're right.

768
01:11:40,401 --> 01:11:44,409
I do prefer your hair down.

769
01:11:45,877 --> 01:11:48,381
You've got nice hair.

770
01:11:48,383 --> 01:11:50,985
It looks nice down.

771
01:11:51,789 --> 01:11:54,562
Yes, you always
did like it down.

772
01:11:56,164 --> 01:12:00,341
You always played with it
with your chubby little hands.

773
01:12:00,975 --> 01:12:01,643
I did wonder.

774
01:12:02,844 --> 01:12:04,113
Oh, don't move.

775
01:12:17,975 --> 01:12:21,647
[Ghostly Voiceover]
Just a mild voltage Joyce.

776
01:12:21,649 --> 01:12:25,154
[Ghostly Voiceover] This'll
help. Like re-tuning a radio.

777
01:12:25,156 --> 01:12:27,729
[Ghostly Voiceover]
Clearing the static.

[Ghostly Voiceover] Have you
worked out what's happening?

No.

01:13:03,064 --> 01:13:05,771
Still a head full
of nothingness.

(phone rings)

786
01:13:16,493 --> 01:13:17,328
Yes?

787
01:13:19,666 --> 01:13:21,800
Yes of course she's one of mine.

788
01:13:21,802 --> 01:13:23,138
Well since when?

789
01:13:24,609 --> 01:13:26,376
Well, she's never supposed
to be unsupervised.

790
01:13:26,378 --> 01:13:28,883
I don't care how calm she was.

Jesus Christ!

792
01:13:32,089 --> 01:13:33,659
What about the tag?

793
01:13:34,995 --> 01:13:35,830
No.

794
01:13:36,933 --> 01:13:37,869
I'll do it.

795
01:13:38,971 --> 01:13:40,708
I know where that is.

(car engine revving)

01:15:00,098 --> 01:15:01,934
[Ghostly Voiceover]
Time's up Joyce.

826
01:15:01,936 --> 01:15:03,137
Time's up Joyce.

827
01:15:03,139 --> 01:15:04,439
Time's up Joyce.

828
01:15:04,441 --> 01:15:05,410
Time's up.

829
01:15:07,681 --> 01:15:10,152
[Man] Hello? Joyce.

830
01:15:10,888 --> 01:15:12,324
One second darling.

831
01:15:13,325 --> 01:15:14,829
My husband's here.

832
01:15:17,702 --> 01:15:18,637
Oh darling.

833
01:15:19,839 --> 01:15:21,808
Oh thank goodness you're home.

834
01:15:21,810 --> 01:15:24,716
You'll never believe
what I've been through.

835
01:15:29,225 --> 01:15:30,427
I didn't kill him.

836
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:32,361
I didn't want to.

837
01:15:32,363 --> 01:15:34,433
They tried to make
me but I didn't, see?

838
01:15:34,435 --> 01:15:35,969
I'm fighting them.

839
01:15:35,971 --> 01:15:39,210
That's good,
you made a choice,

840
01:15:39,212 --> 01:15:41,814
a choice that you never
gave yourself before.

841
01:15:41,816 --> 01:15:42,749
I don't understand.

842
01:15:42,751 --> 01:15:43,819
Yes you do.

843
01:15:46,526 --> 01:15:48,730
Your family, you remember?

844
01:15:49,464 --> 01:15:51,168
Your husband, your son?

845
01:15:54,208 --> 01:15:56,510
Look, I know you've come
here to try to work through

846
01:15:56,512 --> 01:15:57,712
the pain of what happened,

847
01:15:57,714 --> 01:15:59,717
but I need to take
you back to the unit.

848
01:15:59,719 --> 01:16:01,621
But it's different this time.

849
01:16:01,623 --> 01:16:03,122
I made a choice.

850
01:16:03,124 --> 01:16:04,392
I did hit him, I'm sorry.

851
01:16:04,394 --> 01:16:05,162
I hit him.

852
01:16:06,565 --> 01:16:07,967
It's okay, mum.

853
01:16:13,479 --> 01:16:15,316
You came back to me.

854
01:16:16,753 --> 01:16:18,454
(birds chirping)

855
01:16:18,456 --> 01:16:19,689
(chuckle)

856
01:16:19,691 --> 01:16:21,927
You're mommy's little
darling, aren't you?

857
01:16:21,929 --> 01:16:23,632
(child's laughter)

858
01:16:24,502 --> 01:16:27,274
(dramatic music)

859
01:16:33,186 --> 01:16:35,888
You're not my husband, are you?

860
01:16:35,890 --> 01:16:38,396
No, I'm your doctor.

861
01:16:39,764 --> 01:16:41,033
I'm Dr. Hadley.

862
01:16:57,133 --> 01:16:58,668
How are you feeling?

863
01:16:58,670 --> 01:17:01,239
Good, I'm feeling really good.

864
01:17:01,241 --> 01:17:02,409
Excellent.

865
01:17:02,411 --> 01:17:04,746
I knew this was a good idea.

866
01:17:04,748 --> 01:17:06,150
Bit of fresh air.

867
01:17:08,355 --> 01:17:11,160
This is my house, my retreat.

868
01:17:12,931 --> 01:17:14,632
I come here to unwind,

869
01:17:14,634 --> 01:17:17,205
get away from all the stress.

870
01:17:17,207 --> 01:17:18,608
It's beautiful.

871
01:17:18,610 --> 01:17:19,445
Mmm.

872
01:17:21,548 --> 01:17:23,218
(birds singing)

873
01:17:25,424 --> 01:17:29,431
If you ever need a bit
of air, a bit of space...

874
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:39,349
I'm not Mrs. Hadley.

875
01:17:39,351 --> 01:17:40,186
No.

876
01:17:41,289 --> 01:17:44,762
You're Mrs. Simons,
Joyce Simons.

877
01:17:47,032 --> 01:17:49,470
[Joyce] No darling, please!

878
01:17:49,472 --> 01:17:50,971
(sobbing)

879
01:17:50,973 --> 01:17:54,547
I will get better, I will
take my pills I promise!

880
01:17:55,649 --> 01:17:57,887
My husband, he
wanted to leave me.

881
01:17:59,625 --> 01:18:01,025
Please, please don't do this.

882
01:18:01,027 --> 01:18:03,631
I will get better I promise.

883
01:18:03,633 --> 01:18:05,468
But he couldn't leave.

884
01:18:05,470 --> 01:18:07,004
I will take my pills
every single day.

885
01:18:07,006 --> 01:18:08,040
I will, I will, please!

886
01:18:08,042 --> 01:18:09,743
Couldn't stay either.

887
01:18:09,745 --> 01:18:10,879
(gun fires)

888
01:18:10,881 --> 01:18:13,219
(screaming)

889
01:18:16,258 --> 01:18:18,761
Maybe he thought that
leaving John behind

890
01:18:18,763 --> 01:18:20,665
was some kind of consolation.

891
01:18:20,667 --> 01:18:24,004
That's enough, get out of
my sight stupid little shit!

892
01:18:24,006 --> 01:18:25,073
(child's laughter)

893
01:18:25,075 --> 01:18:26,446
(gun fires)
(birds chirping)

894
01:18:27,848 --> 01:18:31,021
I blamed my son for my
husband shooting himself.

895
01:18:35,629 --> 01:18:38,368
(dramatic music)

896
01:18:49,692 --> 01:18:50,527
My child.

897
01:18:52,231 --> 01:18:53,065
My son.

898
01:18:55,068 --> 01:18:58,242
You were so frightened
and I hurt you.

899
01:18:59,109 --> 01:19:00,011
I miss you.

900
01:19:01,883 --> 01:19:03,286
I miss you too.

901
01:19:04,454 --> 01:19:05,489
I'll be okay.

902
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:09,464
I'm sorry, John.

903
01:19:12,371 --> 01:19:13,806
I love you mum.

904
01:19:15,309 --> 01:19:17,314
I love you too my son.

905
01:19:37,153 --> 01:19:38,755
Is it over now?

906
01:19:39,491 --> 01:19:40,924
It's up to you.

907
01:19:40,926 --> 01:19:44,267
Maybe this is the last
time you need to come here.

908
01:19:58,596 --> 01:20:01,566
(soft piano music)

909
01:20:01,568 --> 01:20:04,974
(wind blowing)

910
01:20:16,731 --> 01:20:19,201
(door knocks)

911
01:20:19,203 --> 01:20:20,338
[John] Can you let me in?

912
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:22,107
No, go away?

913
01:20:22,109 --> 01:20:23,677
[John] Can I just use
your phone or anything

914
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:25,849
just for a minute, please?

915
01:20:30,092 --> 01:20:32,195
What do you want?

916
01:20:32,197 --> 01:20:34,130
Do you know what time
it is for God's sake?

917
01:20:34,132 --> 01:20:35,301
[John] Please let me in.

918
01:20:35,303 --> 01:20:37,839
I think I busted my arm.

919
01:20:37,841 --> 01:20:38,676
Okay.

920
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:42,851
Well hurry before we
both freeze to death.

921
01:20:44,187 --> 01:20:45,488
[John] I don't think
poking is gonna...

922
01:20:45,490 --> 01:20:47,526
I'm not going to poke it!

923
01:20:49,365 --> 01:20:50,199
I'm sorry.

924
01:20:51,735 --> 01:20:53,839
(grunts)

925
01:20:57,011 --> 01:21:00,452
(distant birds chirping)

926
01:21:21,694 --> 01:21:24,468
(dramatic music)

927
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:05,012
I want to talk about
what I did to my son.

928
01:22:05,014 --> 01:22:06,149
I'm ready now.

929
01:22:19,176 --> 01:22:22,115
[John] You don't
need me anymore.

930
01:22:29,597 --> 01:22:32,336
(dramatic music)

931
01:22:36,423 --> 01:22:41,423
