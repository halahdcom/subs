00:04:08,304 --> 00:04:09,974
Hello.

3
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,644
What are you doing
in my house?

4
00:05:50,005 --> 00:05:51,274
We're gonna be late.

5
00:05:53,342 --> 00:05:54,678
I got it.

6
00:06:13,829 --> 00:06:16,366
There you are.
Who knew you had so much stuff?

7
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:19,704
Your dad is the Tetris king.

8
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:30,844
- She doesn't have to like it. Not why we're doing this.
- Where's Luke at?

9
00:06:30,846 --> 00:06:33,113
He's at the ball park with his friends.
We're gonna pick him up...

10
00:06:33,115 --> 00:06:35,950
- Jesus, we are late.
- You expect something else from this family?

11
00:06:35,952 --> 00:06:36,987
No, I do not.

12
00:06:38,387 --> 00:06:40,221
Ain't no way we're gonna
get there before dinner.

13
00:06:40,223 --> 00:06:41,992
Uncle Marv said
he could leave a key.

14
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,424
Okay.

15
00:06:44,426 --> 00:06:45,395
Huh?

16
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,065
Oh, boom!

17
00:06:49,031 --> 00:06:50,000
Let's go!

18
00:06:51,101 --> 00:06:52,269
Seat belt, missy.

19
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:14,358
Luke!

20
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,229
We just started a new game.

21
00:07:21,231 --> 00:07:23,498
Sorry, kiddo.
We're already late.

22
00:07:26,837 --> 00:07:28,038
Hey, let me know how it goes.

23
00:07:30,005 --> 00:07:31,041
Okay.

24
00:07:32,942 --> 00:07:35,275
Why can't I just
stay here for the weekend?

25
00:07:35,277 --> 00:07:38,246
- By yourself? No, sir.
- All my friends do it.

26
00:07:38,248 --> 00:07:40,281
- Yeah, exactly.
- Exactly.

27
00:07:40,283 --> 00:07:41,916
Besides, it might be nice
for you to help your sister

28
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:43,217
move into her
new school tomorrow.

29
00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:44,454
Hold on.
I'm gonna leave a message.

30
00:07:45,921 --> 00:07:46,955
You smell horrible.

31
00:07:46,957 --> 00:07:48,589
Hi, Uncle Marv.
It's Cindy.

32
00:07:48,591 --> 00:07:50,325
We got a late start,

33
00:07:50,327 --> 00:07:54,195
so we're not going to be
to Gatlin Lake until, um,

34
00:07:54,197 --> 00:07:55,430
around 9:00 or 10:00.

35
00:07:55,432 --> 00:07:56,864
Hey, guys, cut it out.

36
00:07:56,866 --> 00:07:58,265
We'll just stop for a bite.

37
00:07:58,267 --> 00:08:00,635
Do you guys remember
Uncle Marv and Aunt Sheryl?

38
00:08:00,637 --> 00:08:03,537
I remember Uncle Marv
smelled like wet dog and beer.

39
00:08:07,176 --> 00:08:10,477
You know Mom and Dad are going broke over
sending you to boarding school, right?

40
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,580
Hey, we never said that.

41
00:08:12,582 --> 00:08:14,851
Why else would you guys
have canceled the cable?

42
00:08:19,421 --> 00:08:20,490
See? I was right.

43
00:08:24,293 --> 00:08:26,628
- You think I wanted this?
- I think you like the attention.

44
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,161
- You're a dick.
- You're a queef.

45
00:08:28,163 --> 00:08:29,132
Whoa!

46
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:31,835
What-what's queef?

47
00:08:36,138 --> 00:08:37,240
Seriously, what's a queef?

48
00:08:55,358 --> 00:08:58,161
- You want me to go get her?
- She's punishing us.

49
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,598
Folks need another couple
of minutes with the menus or...

50
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,003
Yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna
need a few, thank you.

51
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,007
I'll go.

52
00:09:23,353 --> 00:09:24,555
Not even gonna
pretend, huh?

53
00:09:27,357 --> 00:09:28,559
What difference
does it make?

54
00:09:41,103 --> 00:09:42,573
What difference
does it make, right?

55
00:09:45,007 --> 00:09:47,176
Just ditch those before
you get to your new school.

56
00:09:49,713 --> 00:09:51,379
God forbid they kick me out.

57
00:09:51,381 --> 00:09:53,614
Oh, they're not gonna
give up that easy.

58
00:09:53,616 --> 00:09:55,452
No, no. Not like
you and Dad, huh?

59
00:10:00,623 --> 00:10:02,526
I wish someone
had done this for me.

60
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,497
You turned out fine.

61
00:10:07,664 --> 00:10:08,999
You didn't
know me back then.

62
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,536
I made mistakes.
A lot of them.

63
00:10:15,137 --> 00:10:18,706
Teenagers do stupid shit, Mom.
I am a teenager.

64
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,611
This is more than
stupid shit, Kins.

65
00:10:22,177 --> 00:10:23,379
This past year?

66
00:10:25,482 --> 00:10:28,149
Sabrina, Laurie, none of them.

67
00:10:28,151 --> 00:10:31,052
None of their parents
are sending them off.

68
00:10:31,054 --> 00:10:33,321
Well, I'm not their mother.
I'm yours.

69
00:10:33,323 --> 00:10:34,257
They're lucky.

70
00:10:35,492 --> 00:10:37,094
And I am worried about you.

71
00:10:39,728 --> 00:10:41,198
And now you won't
have to worry.

72
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,236
Be just the three of you again like
it always should have been, right?

73
00:10:50,073 --> 00:10:51,408
You believe that?

74
00:12:16,859 --> 00:12:18,294
There even anybody here?

75
00:12:19,661 --> 00:12:22,199
I think everybody leaves
after Labor Day.

76
00:12:45,821 --> 00:12:48,858
The office is
a little further down.

77
00:14:16,546 --> 00:14:18,645
They left a note, said they'd
see us in the morning.

78
00:14:18,647 --> 00:14:20,814
We're staying in number 47.

79
00:15:34,523 --> 00:15:36,356
This is nice, right?

80
00:15:36,358 --> 00:15:37,793
Mm. Cozy.

81
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,566
Okay, so, who's staying
in this trailer?

82
00:15:45,568 --> 00:15:46,603
All of us.

83
00:15:47,336 --> 00:15:48,869
Of course.

84
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:53,810
Hmm.

85
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,611
Is there someone else
staying here?

86
00:15:57,613 --> 00:15:58,547
That's weird.

87
00:16:00,717 --> 00:16:02,616
Hmm. Should I toss it?

88
00:16:02,618 --> 00:16:04,117
What, are you
gonna eat it?

89
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:06,353
- Throw it out.
- It smells fine. It's beef and broccoli.

90
00:16:06,355 --> 00:16:08,356
- Please do not eat that.
- I love it.

91
00:16:08,358 --> 00:16:10,627
- There are no glasses.
- Just chug, woman.

92
00:16:12,362 --> 00:16:14,562
Remember when we went
camping in the Rockies?

93
00:16:14,564 --> 00:16:16,529
- That's exactly what I was referring to.
- Mm-hmm.

94
00:16:19,569 --> 00:16:21,836
Is that Uncle Marv?

95
00:16:21,838 --> 00:16:23,471
- Probably.
- He probably smelled the wine.

96
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,976
Mom, there's someone knocking.

97
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:30,012
No, don't get up.
I've got it.

98
00:16:35,118 --> 00:16:37,451
It's a girl.

99
00:16:37,453 --> 00:16:38,387
Girl?

100
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,996
Can I help you?

101
00:16:47,662 --> 00:16:48,831
Is Tamara home?

102
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:54,403
I think you have
the wrong trailer.

103
00:16:57,172 --> 00:16:58,474
Okay.

104
00:17:09,084 --> 00:17:10,484
I didn't think anyone else
was staying here.

105
00:17:10,486 --> 00:17:12,953
She must be lost.

106
00:17:12,955 --> 00:17:16,026
All right, guys. You wanna
play some cards or something?

107
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:24,767
- Well, you and me.
- It's you and me.

108
00:17:41,217 --> 00:17:43,085
You guys sure
you don't wanna join us?

109
00:17:44,152 --> 00:17:46,019
Oh, come on.

110
00:17:46,021 --> 00:17:48,956
Can we just have one last evening
where you're not on your phones?

111
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:56,700
Okay.

112
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,834
Thank you.

113
00:18:02,537 --> 00:18:04,471
What do you wanna play?

114
00:18:04,473 --> 00:18:06,940
Five hundred.
We'll keep you here all night.

115
00:18:06,942 --> 00:18:08,411
Oh.

116
00:18:15,084 --> 00:18:17,251
Come on, why don't
you just put that down,

117
00:18:17,253 --> 00:18:19,589
just for a while,
and join us?

118
00:18:25,126 --> 00:18:26,462
Sweetheart, this, um...

119
00:18:29,565 --> 00:18:30,866
this parent gig,
you know, it's, uh...

120
00:18:33,102 --> 00:18:34,004
it's tough.

121
00:18:35,203 --> 00:18:37,606
The bad grades.
Cutting class.

122
00:18:38,874 --> 00:18:39,942
We're just scared,
you know?

123
00:18:53,623 --> 00:18:54,524
Thank you.

124
00:18:59,895 --> 00:19:01,961
- Hey. Hey, baby doll.
- Where are you going?

125
00:19:01,963 --> 00:19:03,030
I need some air.

126
00:19:05,834 --> 00:19:07,567
Should I go after her?

127
00:19:07,569 --> 00:19:09,969
No. It'll only
make it worse.

128
00:19:09,971 --> 00:19:11,141
Either one of us.

129
00:19:13,241 --> 00:19:14,911
Luke, you go talk to her.

130
00:19:16,112 --> 00:19:17,611
What? Why?

131
00:19:17,613 --> 00:19:18,748
Because you're her brother.

132
00:19:20,283 --> 00:19:22,486
Can you please do
what your mother asks you?

133
00:19:26,322 --> 00:19:27,491
Okay.

134
00:19:28,924 --> 00:19:30,493
I don't know what you guys
want me to say to her.

135
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,106
No one said
it would be easy.

136
00:19:53,015 --> 00:19:54,184
Kinsey!

137
00:19:57,853 --> 00:19:58,921
Hey, Kins!

138
00:20:14,135 --> 00:20:15,604
Kinsey!

139
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:42,028
What are you doing?

140
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:44,898
I don't know. Mom told me
to come hang with you.

141
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,900
- Such a bitch.
- Just being dramatic.

142
00:20:47,902 --> 00:20:49,639
- Yeah, ya think?
- I meant you.

143
00:20:50,805 --> 00:20:51,807
Fuck off.

144
00:20:56,144 --> 00:20:58,344
You know you're supposed
to inhale those? Cigarettes.

145
00:20:58,346 --> 00:21:00,584
You're supposed to like, um,
actually inhale them.

146
00:21:01,784 --> 00:21:03,883
Come on.

147
00:21:03,885 --> 00:21:06,288
Ah, Sis,
just get over it.

148
00:21:08,123 --> 00:21:11,161
They wanna send you away.
I mean, boo-fuckin'-hoo.

149
00:21:12,728 --> 00:21:15,262
Yeah, you're
out of here next year.

150
00:21:15,264 --> 00:21:16,866
You get to start
your own life.

151
00:21:19,067 --> 00:21:20,636
Maybe it's like that
for you too.

152
00:21:23,139 --> 00:21:25,141
You know, this place
could be a fresh start.

153
00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:30,012
You could be
whoever you want to be.

154
00:21:43,124 --> 00:21:44,026
Don't.

155
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:57,871
You really think
we're doing the right thing?

156
00:22:01,242 --> 00:22:02,709
I know we are.

157
00:22:02,711 --> 00:22:04,314
It's not like
we haven't tried everything.

158
00:22:07,216 --> 00:22:08,184
Yeah.

159
00:22:20,496 --> 00:22:24,931
It'll be nice to have the house
back to ourselves again, I guess,

160
00:22:24,933 --> 00:22:26,268
once Luke goes off to college.

161
00:22:31,273 --> 00:22:33,209
We can do it on the couch
like we used to.

162
00:22:38,748 --> 00:22:40,115
I look so tired.

163
00:22:42,383 --> 00:22:43,752
You look beautiful.

164
00:23:03,271 --> 00:23:04,473
I love you.

165
00:23:09,879 --> 00:23:11,344
You lock 'em out?

166
00:23:11,346 --> 00:23:12,315
Mm-mmm.

167
00:23:27,095 --> 00:23:30,063
Guys, the door's not even locked.

168
00:23:30,065 --> 00:23:31,301
Is Tamara home?

169
00:23:34,469 --> 00:23:37,273
You lost or something?
You want me to call someone?

170
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:41,877
Are you okay?

171
00:24:12,274 --> 00:24:13,209
Same girl?

172
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,045
Yeah.

173
00:24:17,046 --> 00:24:18,411
Where are the kids?

174
00:24:18,413 --> 00:24:20,282
- What?
- Did they wander off?

175
00:24:26,921 --> 00:24:28,223
Luke!

176
00:24:29,424 --> 00:24:30,359
Kinsey!

177
00:24:32,393 --> 00:24:34,127
I'm gonna get my shoes.

178
00:24:34,129 --> 00:24:35,495
I'm sure they're okay.
I mean...

179
00:24:35,497 --> 00:24:37,566
- That girl weirded me out, hon.
- Yeah. Yeah, that was...

180
00:24:40,268 --> 00:24:41,805
a little...

181
00:25:06,027 --> 00:25:07,894
Remember when I was
in Little League?

182
00:25:07,896 --> 00:25:10,330
You used to follow me
to the park.

183
00:25:10,332 --> 00:25:13,499
Yeah, I always wanted to play.
You never let me.

184
00:25:13,501 --> 00:25:15,537
Well, 'cause you were little, Sis.
That's just how it goes.

185
00:25:17,573 --> 00:25:20,243
You could barely lift up the
bat, let alone hit anything.

186
00:25:23,545 --> 00:25:25,245
Here.

187
00:25:25,247 --> 00:25:26,615
Wind up for the pitch.

188
00:25:31,487 --> 00:25:33,022
Mmm, what about
the mailbox?

189
00:25:35,924 --> 00:25:37,990
Oh, nice.

190
00:25:37,992 --> 00:25:40,326
- Should have let me play.
- Hmm.

191
00:25:40,328 --> 00:25:44,497
What do you think Uncle Marv and Aunt
Sheryl do here all alone in the winter?

192
00:25:44,499 --> 00:25:45,631
Oh, I don't know.

193
00:25:45,633 --> 00:25:48,067
Probably have tons
of filthy, porno sex.

194
00:25:48,069 --> 00:25:49,004
Ew.

195
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,008
Weird.

196
00:25:54,509 --> 00:25:55,478
Yeah.

197
00:25:59,715 --> 00:26:01,885
- Are you scared?
- No.

198
00:26:12,428 --> 00:26:13,563
Hello.

199
00:26:24,605 --> 00:26:25,973
Hello.

200
00:26:25,975 --> 00:26:28,274
Oh, geez!

201
00:26:28,276 --> 00:26:30,009
I'm gonna kill you.
That's not funny.

202
00:26:30,011 --> 00:26:31,346
Oh, God.

203
00:26:44,692 --> 00:26:48,195
Mmm. Bingo.

204
00:26:48,197 --> 00:26:49,563
Okay, yes. One shot.

205
00:26:49,565 --> 00:26:51,230
- Three.
- Two.

206
00:26:51,232 --> 00:26:52,399
All right.

207
00:26:56,071 --> 00:26:57,707
- What was that?
- I don't know.

208
00:27:03,778 --> 00:27:06,015
- Come on, we should get out of here.
- Wait. Wait.

209
00:27:12,321 --> 00:27:13,256
Is somebody there?

210
00:27:15,556 --> 00:27:17,360
- Luke, seriously, let's go.
- No, let's just...

211
00:27:30,271 --> 00:27:31,206
Hello.

212
00:27:35,411 --> 00:27:36,645
Is somebody there?

213
00:27:45,787 --> 00:27:47,586
Oh, geez.

214
00:27:50,292 --> 00:27:51,494
It scared me
half to death.

215
00:27:56,364 --> 00:27:58,698
What the hell is that?

216
00:28:01,335 --> 00:28:02,438
Nothing.

217
00:28:11,513 --> 00:28:12,415
What the hell?

218
00:28:19,455 --> 00:28:20,690
What the fuck?

219
00:28:25,561 --> 00:28:27,063
- Luke.
- What?

220
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,815
Oh, my God.

221
00:28:55,657 --> 00:28:57,490
Come on.

222
00:28:57,492 --> 00:28:59,094
- Okay. Okay.
- Come on. Come on.

223
00:29:11,773 --> 00:29:13,873
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

224
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:15,742
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

225
00:29:15,744 --> 00:29:17,476
- Did we come from that way? No, no...
- I don't... I don't know.

226
00:29:17,478 --> 00:29:18,648
It all looks the same.

227
00:29:19,614 --> 00:29:20,613
Here. Okay.

228
00:29:22,316 --> 00:29:24,251
- Jesus!
- You guys, what the hell is going on?

229
00:29:24,253 --> 00:29:26,686
Uncle Marv and Aunt Sheryl are all cut
up and there's blood everywhere...

230
00:29:26,688 --> 00:29:28,487
- Luke.
- If this is a joke...

231
00:29:28,489 --> 00:29:30,890
It's not a joke. I swear I
would not joke about this.

232
00:29:30,892 --> 00:29:32,325
Where was this?
Where did you see this?

233
00:29:32,327 --> 00:29:36,396
In one of the trailers. One of the
trailers was open and we went inside.

234
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:37,863
I'm... I'm not...
I'm not messing with you.

235
00:29:37,865 --> 00:29:39,865
I swear.

236
00:29:39,867 --> 00:29:42,370
He's not. He's not.
I... We both swear.

237
00:29:44,338 --> 00:29:45,538
They're all cut up.

238
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,840
Okay, get Kinsey
back in the trailer.

239
00:29:46,842 --> 00:29:48,207
What?

240
00:29:48,209 --> 00:29:50,209
- Take Kinsey back to the trailer.
- Okay.

241
00:29:50,211 --> 00:29:52,879
Call the police
and lock the door, okay?

242
00:29:52,881 --> 00:29:53,783
Okay.

243
00:29:55,816 --> 00:29:57,284
- Do you know how to get back there?
- Yeah.

244
00:29:57,286 --> 00:29:59,186
- Can you show me?
- Yeah, I think so.

245
00:29:59,188 --> 00:29:59,789
We came from there.

246
00:30:03,792 --> 00:30:05,128
I'm scared, Dad.

247
00:30:06,862 --> 00:30:08,397
Who would do
something like that?

248
00:30:18,306 --> 00:30:19,909
Okay.

249
00:30:24,478 --> 00:30:26,246
- You're okay.
- No, I'm not.

250
00:30:26,248 --> 00:30:29,282
- You're okay.
- No, I'm not. No, I'm not.

251
00:30:29,284 --> 00:30:32,451
They weren't okay. They weren't okay.
They weren't okay.

252
00:30:34,355 --> 00:30:37,657
You are going to be okay.
It's okay.

253
00:30:37,659 --> 00:30:38,828
It's okay.

254
00:30:44,298 --> 00:30:45,200
Mom.

255
00:30:47,436 --> 00:30:49,839
Mom, the phones.
The phones.

256
00:30:59,448 --> 00:31:00,516
Mommy.

257
00:31:02,417 --> 00:31:03,619
Oh, my God.

258
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,612
Oh, my God.

259
00:31:36,817 --> 00:31:37,886
Hello.

260
00:31:39,888 --> 00:31:41,287
Hello.

261
00:31:41,289 --> 00:31:43,355
<i>9-1-1 emergency.</i>

262
00:31:43,357 --> 00:31:44,392
Hello, can you hear me?

263
00:31:50,966 --> 00:31:52,468
Hello. Can you hear me?

264
00:31:54,536 --> 00:31:55,403
- Mom.
- Hello?

265
00:31:56,337 --> 00:31:57,272
Hello? Hell...

266
00:31:58,673 --> 00:32:00,774
Mom. Mom.

267
00:32:00,776 --> 00:32:02,007
Mom?

268
00:32:02,009 --> 00:32:03,645
Mom.

269
00:32:05,613 --> 00:32:07,781
What do you want? Hello?

270
00:32:07,783 --> 00:32:09,716
- Hello!
- Mom!

271
00:32:09,718 --> 00:32:12,819
Can you hear me?
I need to report a murder.

272
00:32:12,821 --> 00:32:14,290
Hello. Can anyone hear...

273
00:32:18,093 --> 00:32:19,892
No.

274
00:32:23,931 --> 00:32:25,598
Get in the bedroom!

275
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,699
Shut it!

276
00:32:29,571 --> 00:32:31,737
In the bathroom!
Shut the door!

277
00:32:37,045 --> 00:32:38,680
God. Please, God.

278
00:32:54,662 --> 00:32:57,063
Leave us alone!

279
00:32:57,065 --> 00:32:58,334
Mommy.

280
00:33:00,102 --> 00:33:01,370
Who is she?

281
00:33:35,469 --> 00:33:37,035
- Okay.
- I got it. I got it.

282
00:33:37,037 --> 00:33:38,838
- I'm gonna lift you up.
- Okay.

283
00:33:46,014 --> 00:33:47,616
Pull yourself up!

284
00:33:51,987 --> 00:33:53,488
Come on!

285
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:58,056
Go! You go! Run!

286
00:33:58,058 --> 00:33:59,958
Oh, my God!

287
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,095
Run. You have to run!

288
00:34:03,097 --> 00:34:04,866
No. Oh, my God.

289
00:34:07,001 --> 00:34:08,734
Baby, go.

290
00:34:12,707 --> 00:34:13,806
Mommy!

291
00:34:18,913 --> 00:34:21,047
Let go of her!

292
00:35:16,538 --> 00:35:17,773
This is it, right?

293
00:35:18,607 --> 00:35:19,608
Yeah, it's this one.

294
00:35:23,511 --> 00:35:25,678
- Okay, just wait here.
- What?

295
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,246
Just let me look.

296
00:35:27,248 --> 00:35:29,218
I've already been there.
I've already seen it.

297
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,616
They don't work.

298
00:36:03,151 --> 00:36:04,553
Back room.

299
00:36:36,084 --> 00:36:38,817
We gotta call the cops.

300
00:36:38,819 --> 00:36:41,823
- You got a phone on you?
- No, I... I think I left it back at the trailer.

301
00:36:43,991 --> 00:36:44,959
Okay.

302
00:36:48,363 --> 00:36:49,931
What the fuck?

303
00:36:50,765 --> 00:36:51,667
Right there.

304
00:36:55,303 --> 00:36:57,770
Fuck.

305
00:36:57,772 --> 00:36:58,873
Oh, fuck.

306
00:37:06,381 --> 00:37:08,614
<i>Hi, Uncle Marv. It's Cindy.</i>

307
00:37:08,616 --> 00:37:10,283
<i>We got a late start,</i>

308
00:37:10,285 --> 00:37:14,120
<i>so we're not going to be to Gatlin
Lake until, um, around 9:00 or 10:00</i>

309
00:37:14,122 --> 00:37:15,324
Shit.

310
00:37:16,056 --> 00:37:17,656
What was that?

311
00:37:20,962 --> 00:37:23,196
- Dad?
- Shh.

312
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:38,581
Fuck! Get down!

313
00:37:44,118 --> 00:37:45,685
Who is that?

314
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:06,339
Okay, we're gonna
get back to Mom and Kinsey.

315
00:38:06,341 --> 00:38:08,741
Okay, we're gonna make
a run for it, okay?

316
00:38:08,743 --> 00:38:10,243
- Mm-hmm.
- You're gonna run like hell.

317
00:38:10,245 --> 00:38:11,277
- I'm gonna be right behind you.
- Okay.

318
00:38:11,279 --> 00:38:13,212
And you don't stop until
we get right back to them.

319
00:38:13,214 --> 00:38:14,149
- Okay?
- Okay.

320
00:38:16,216 --> 00:38:17,151
Go!

321
00:38:23,892 --> 00:38:24,960
Dad.

322
00:38:31,198 --> 00:38:32,364
Shit.

323
00:38:41,843 --> 00:38:43,076
- What are you doing?
- There was a gun.

324
00:38:43,078 --> 00:38:44,647
I remember they used
to have a gun in here.

325
00:38:47,948 --> 00:38:48,916
Hang on.

326
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:56,658
Do you know how to use that?

327
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,062
Are you... Are you
really gonna shoot them?

328
00:39:08,469 --> 00:39:10,103
Okay, you have five seconds!

329
00:39:10,105 --> 00:39:13,004
Five seconds to leave
and then I start shooting!

330
00:39:16,277 --> 00:39:17,680
Five!

331
00:39:18,513 --> 00:39:19,681
Four!

332
00:39:20,448 --> 00:39:21,781
Three!

333
00:39:22,817 --> 00:39:23,952
Two!

334
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,087
One!

335
00:39:40,134 --> 00:39:41,203
Go check back there.

336
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:48,843
They're gone.

337
00:39:50,344 --> 00:39:51,413
Okay, we'll go back.

338
00:39:52,781 --> 00:39:54,216
Come on,
you stay with me. Okay?

339
00:39:57,285 --> 00:39:58,219
Come on!

340
00:40:10,098 --> 00:40:11,033
Oh, my God.

341
00:40:16,805 --> 00:40:19,071
No!

342
00:40:19,073 --> 00:40:20,007
Okay.

343
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:22,777
Help!

344
00:40:24,212 --> 00:40:25,280
Please!

345
00:40:42,897 --> 00:40:45,801
Fuck! Kinsey! Cindy!

346
00:40:50,171 --> 00:40:51,205
That's my phone.

347
00:41:22,169 --> 00:41:23,337
Oh.

348
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,843
Dad, what is it?

349
00:41:32,279 --> 00:41:33,314
No, no, no!

350
00:41:39,319 --> 00:41:41,987
We have
to go find your sister.

351
00:41:41,989 --> 00:41:45,558
Listen to me! We're
gonna go find your sister, okay?

352
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,158
- I need you to be with me.
- Okay.

353
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,895
What do we have to do?

354
00:41:48,897 --> 00:41:50,562
I'm gonna get the car
and we're gonna go find her.

355
00:41:50,564 --> 00:41:51,833
All right? Okay?

356
00:41:53,567 --> 00:41:54,969
Kinsey!

357
00:42:14,087 --> 00:42:15,022
Kin!

358
00:42:17,357 --> 00:42:19,260
Kinsey!

359
00:42:22,529 --> 00:42:23,865
Where is she?

360
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,202
Come on, Kins!

361
00:42:33,607 --> 00:42:35,109
Kinsey!

362
00:42:38,478 --> 00:42:40,112
Kinsey!

363
00:42:40,114 --> 00:42:42,013
Oh, shit!

364
00:43:01,502 --> 00:43:04,038
This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.

365
00:43:28,161 --> 00:43:30,996
Hello?

366
00:44:36,064 --> 00:44:37,562
Leave us alone!

367
00:44:37,564 --> 00:44:39,531
But we've just started.

368
00:44:39,533 --> 00:44:40,501
Aah!

369
00:45:03,857 --> 00:45:06,424
Oh, God. Dad?

370
00:45:06,426 --> 00:45:08,726
No. Dad. Dad. Dad, wake up.

371
00:45:08,728 --> 00:45:10,562
Wake up. Come on.

372
00:45:10,564 --> 00:45:13,332
Fuck. Luke, Dad.

373
00:45:13,334 --> 00:45:14,667
Fuck.

374
00:45:14,669 --> 00:45:16,368
- You okay?
- Fuck.

375
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:17,402
Oh, my God.

376
00:45:20,507 --> 00:45:22,241
Aah! I can't...

377
00:45:22,243 --> 00:45:24,275
I can't.

378
00:45:24,277 --> 00:45:28,746
Okay, I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm gonna, uh,
try and, uh, pull-pull it out.

379
00:45:28,748 --> 00:45:31,317
Okay, I'm-I'm gonna...
I'm gonna...

380
00:45:31,319 --> 00:45:34,587
Aah! Shit.

381
00:45:34,589 --> 00:45:36,821
Fucking...

382
00:45:36,823 --> 00:45:39,460
Tell me what to do.
What do you want me to do?

383
00:45:41,261 --> 00:45:43,596
Okay, you...
you gotta get out of here.

384
00:45:43,598 --> 00:45:44,897
I'm not gonna leave you.

385
00:45:44,899 --> 00:45:47,266
- Get the fuck out of here.
- I'm not gonna leave you.

386
00:45:47,268 --> 00:45:49,134
- You gotta find your sister.
- I'm not gonna leave you.

387
00:45:49,136 --> 00:45:50,071
She needs you.

388
00:45:51,806 --> 00:45:54,339
The gun.
Okay, find the gun.

389
00:45:54,341 --> 00:45:57,143
Um... Here.

390
00:45:57,145 --> 00:45:59,511
- You know how to use that thing?
- No.

391
00:45:59,513 --> 00:46:01,647
You just...
It's loaded, okay?

392
00:46:01,649 --> 00:46:04,482
Pull back on the hammer and
then you squeeze the trigger.

393
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:07,585
Okay. You're gonna be okay.

394
00:46:07,587 --> 00:46:09,221
You're gonna be okay.

395
00:46:09,223 --> 00:46:12,393
Oh, fuck.

396
00:46:14,895 --> 00:46:17,562
Okay. Okay.

397
00:46:17,564 --> 00:46:19,665
I'm gonna go find her, okay?

398
00:46:19,667 --> 00:46:21,734
We're gonna get the cops. We're
gonna get the ambulance, okay?

399
00:46:21,736 --> 00:46:23,105
I'm gonna be right back.

400
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,243
I'm proud of you.

401
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,515
I know.

402
00:47:19,593 --> 00:47:22,296
Aah!

403
00:47:23,464 --> 00:47:25,834
Fuck! Aah!

404
00:47:39,747 --> 00:47:41,449
Please.

405
00:47:42,783 --> 00:47:44,685
Please.

406
00:47:46,486 --> 00:47:49,621
Please.

407
00:47:49,623 --> 00:47:52,391
Why are you
doing this?

408
00:47:52,393 --> 00:47:53,826
Fuck!

409
00:48:10,745 --> 00:48:14,879
Please. Hey, whatever it is
you're doing, just stop.

410
00:48:14,881 --> 00:48:17,850
Okay, you leave
my family alone.

411
00:48:17,852 --> 00:48:20,051
Let my family go.

412
00:48:20,053 --> 00:48:21,953
Please.

413
00:48:24,424 --> 00:48:26,525
Please.

414
00:48:30,598 --> 00:48:34,732
Okay. Okay, can we just
talk about this, okay?

415
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:38,569
Aah!

416
00:48:38,571 --> 00:48:40,071
Fuck!

417
00:48:40,073 --> 00:48:42,940
Aah!

418
00:48:42,942 --> 00:48:45,310
You mother... Fuck you!

419
00:48:45,312 --> 00:48:48,315
Aah! Aah!

420
00:50:36,457 --> 00:50:37,859
Oh, my God.

421
00:50:41,828 --> 00:50:43,497
Kinsey!

422
00:51:12,091 --> 00:51:13,660
Hello.

423
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:05,112
Whee!

424
00:52:08,982 --> 00:52:10,584
No, no, no.

425
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:14,652
Stop!

426
00:52:14,654 --> 00:52:17,623
Let her go.

427
00:52:17,625 --> 00:52:19,594
Luke.

428
00:52:21,529 --> 00:52:23,031
Luke. Luke.

429
00:52:31,739 --> 00:52:33,641
Put the fucking knife down.

430
00:52:35,975 --> 00:52:37,744
Put the knife down!

431
00:53:00,301 --> 00:53:02,770
Are you gonna shoot me?

432
00:53:05,272 --> 00:53:07,873
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun.

433
00:53:07,875 --> 00:53:10,308
Give me the gun, Luke.
Give me the gun.

434
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:13,515
- Run! Run!
- I will fucking shoot her! I will fucking shoot her!

435
00:53:19,719 --> 00:53:22,589
Go, go, go.

436
00:53:41,375 --> 00:53:43,942
Hey, Luke, the window.

437
00:53:43,944 --> 00:53:46,844
- Do you think you can reach it?
- Yeah, I could give it a try.

438
00:53:46,846 --> 00:53:48,913
Yeah, I'll boost you.

439
00:53:48,915 --> 00:53:50,951
Oh, shit, it hurts.

440
00:53:55,089 --> 00:53:57,054
- You ready?
- Okay.

441
00:53:57,056 --> 00:53:59,357
Okay.

442
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:03,096
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

443
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,306
Oh, my God.

444
00:54:15,308 --> 00:54:17,911
Okay. Hey, you're okay.
Hey, hey.

445
00:54:23,116 --> 00:54:25,049
There's so much blood.

446
00:54:25,051 --> 00:54:26,752
- Grab that shirt off, okay?
- What?

447
00:54:26,754 --> 00:54:28,288
Take that flannel off.

448
00:54:29,422 --> 00:54:30,991
Okay.

449
00:54:35,062 --> 00:54:36,663
It's okay.

450
00:54:42,169 --> 00:54:43,171
Mom.

451
00:54:44,837 --> 00:54:47,205
I know.

452
00:54:47,207 --> 00:54:49,908
Hey, we're gonna
get out of this.

453
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:52,243
- I tried to get her... I tried to get her hand.
- We're gonna get out of this.

454
00:54:52,245 --> 00:54:53,944
Stop.

455
00:54:53,946 --> 00:54:56,147
I had her hand.
I couldn't get her.

456
00:54:56,149 --> 00:54:58,016
I was so mean.

457
00:54:58,018 --> 00:54:59,687
- I was so...
- Hey.

458
00:55:01,187 --> 00:55:04,089
Do you remember that...
Hey, do you remember that...

459
00:55:04,091 --> 00:55:06,891
that time that I fell out
of that tree at Marshpoint.

460
00:55:06,893 --> 00:55:08,893
Do you remember that?

461
00:55:08,895 --> 00:55:10,395
- You remember that.
- Yeah.

462
00:55:10,397 --> 00:55:12,196
Right.

463
00:55:12,198 --> 00:55:14,065
You...

464
00:55:14,067 --> 00:55:17,002
- You rode your bike home even though it was broken.
- Yeah.

465
00:55:17,004 --> 00:55:18,804
You were an idiot.

466
00:55:18,806 --> 00:55:21,806
Total idiot.
Mom found me on the couch.

467
00:55:21,808 --> 00:55:24,946
I was eating pizza, trying to
pretend like nothing happened.

468
00:55:27,314 --> 00:55:29,147
My leg was
all swollen and blue,

469
00:55:29,149 --> 00:55:32,420
and she was like, "Luke,
what the fuck did you do?"

470
00:55:35,189 --> 00:55:36,487
- Aah!
- It's okay.

471
00:55:40,861 --> 00:55:43,261
It's okay.

472
00:55:43,263 --> 00:55:46,498
- She probably said it just like that too.
- It was exactly like that.

473
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,400
"Luke, what the fuck
did you do?"

474
00:55:48,402 --> 00:55:50,338
And she tells us
to watch our mouths.

475
00:55:51,939 --> 00:55:53,674
Here, give me your arm.

476
00:55:57,277 --> 00:55:59,310
It's my fault
that she's dead.

477
00:55:59,312 --> 00:56:01,078
Kins, stop.

478
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,748
No, you wouldn't
have been here, Luke.

479
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:06,851
- You wouldn't have been here if I wasn't such a fuck-up.
- Stop. Just shut up.

480
00:56:06,853 --> 00:56:08,520
- No.
- Shut up.

481
00:56:08,522 --> 00:56:10,855
You know that's not true.

482
00:56:10,857 --> 00:56:13,424
- I'm sorry.
- You know that.

483
00:56:13,426 --> 00:56:14,861
I'm sorry.

484
00:56:17,897 --> 00:56:20,200
Why are they
doing this to us?

485
00:56:21,502 --> 00:56:22,837
Why?

486
00:56:24,937 --> 00:56:27,205
Okay, we got to find
a way out of this.

487
00:56:27,207 --> 00:56:29,174
Okay, we got to get
to a landline.

488
00:56:29,176 --> 00:56:31,375
Call 911.

489
00:56:52,198 --> 00:56:53,931
- Luke. Luke, help.
- Come on.

490
00:57:09,082 --> 00:57:10,884
I... I can't.

491
00:57:12,285 --> 00:57:13,887
Okay, get in there.

492
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,125
- Here.
- Okay.

493
00:57:21,127 --> 00:57:22,426
Give me your hand.

494
00:57:22,428 --> 00:57:24,495
- I'm gonna try and find a way the office.
- What?

495
00:57:24,497 --> 00:57:27,232
You have to stay here.
Trust me. Do not move.

496
00:57:27,234 --> 00:57:29,567
I'm gonna call 911.
Ambulance will come.

497
00:57:29,569 --> 00:57:31,937
- The police will light this whole fucking place...
- I'm coming with you.

498
00:57:31,939 --> 00:57:35,473
No. Stop, stop, stop. Stop.
Listen to me.

499
00:57:35,475 --> 00:57:38,143
I'm gonna be moving much faster and
you're gonna be a lot safer here, okay?

500
00:57:38,145 --> 00:57:39,313
You understand?

501
00:57:40,446 --> 00:57:42,215
- You understand?
- Okay.

502
00:57:44,585 --> 00:57:46,150
I love you, Sis.

503
00:57:46,152 --> 00:57:49,390
- Yeah, I love you too.
- We're gonna be okay.

504
00:57:55,928 --> 00:57:58,330
We're gonna be okay.

505
00:57:58,332 --> 00:57:59,866
We'll be okay.

506
00:58:44,011 --> 00:58:46,011
<i>911.
What's the emergency?</i>

507
00:58:46,013 --> 00:58:49,446
Hi. Um, yeah, we need help. There's
these crazy people trying to kill us.

508
00:58:49,448 --> 00:58:51,449
<i>Okay. Calm down.
What's your address?</i>

509
00:58:51,451 --> 00:58:53,618
Um, I don't know.
I'm not sure.

510
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:56,520
I wasn't... I wasn't paying attention.
It's some trailer park.

511
00:58:56,522 --> 00:58:58,589
I don't know.
I don't know where we are.

512
00:58:58,591 --> 00:59:01,458
Um... Uh... Uh... Uh, Gatlin Lake.

513
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:03,263
It's Gatlin Lake.

514
00:59:05,364 --> 00:59:06,533
Hello?

515
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:08,935
Hello?

516
00:59:28,689 --> 00:59:30,321
Just leave us alone.

517
00:59:37,663 --> 00:59:39,901
Just leave us alone!

518
01:02:13,553 --> 01:02:16,120
I killed one of yours.

519
01:02:16,122 --> 01:02:17,724
How's that feel, huh?

520
01:02:19,558 --> 01:02:21,259
How's that fucking feel?

521
01:04:24,417 --> 01:04:25,853
Luke! Luke!

522
01:04:28,587 --> 01:04:29,790
Luke!

523
01:04:38,964 --> 01:04:42,299
Come on.
I need you to help me. Ready?

524
01:04:59,652 --> 01:05:02,587
Come here. I got you.
Right here. Right here.

525
01:05:02,589 --> 01:05:04,388
Right here. Right here.

526
01:05:04,390 --> 01:05:06,824
Okay.

527
01:05:06,826 --> 01:05:09,294
Okay. We need
to get you help.

528
01:05:09,296 --> 01:05:11,895
Look at me. I need
to get to the main road.

529
01:05:11,897 --> 01:05:13,466
Okay?

530
01:05:16,435 --> 01:05:17,504
Okay. Okay.

531
01:06:19,098 --> 01:06:21,301
Oh, my God, please. No.

532
01:06:23,770 --> 01:06:24,805
Please.

533
01:06:28,875 --> 01:06:30,744
Are you okay?

534
01:06:34,147 --> 01:06:35,980
Whoa.

535
01:06:35,982 --> 01:06:38,549
Okay. Come here.
Come on. It's okay.

536
01:06:38,551 --> 01:06:40,150
It's okay. Come here.

537
01:06:40,152 --> 01:06:42,487
Okay, calm down. Okay.

538
01:06:42,489 --> 01:06:44,821
Calm down. Okay.
It's okay.

539
01:06:44,823 --> 01:06:47,891
- Tell me what happened.
- Okay, I need... I need... I need you to help my brother.

540
01:06:47,893 --> 01:06:50,728
He's at the clubhouse. I told him
to meet me at the clubhouse.

541
01:06:50,730 --> 01:06:52,663
That's where
he might be.

542
01:06:52,665 --> 01:06:55,433
And there are these crazy people,
and they're trying to kill us.

543
01:07:17,890 --> 01:07:18,758
Where are the keys?

544
01:07:19,859 --> 01:07:22,763
Where are the keys?

545
01:07:35,575 --> 01:07:37,643
Come on, come on, come on.

546
01:07:41,013 --> 01:07:43,013
Get off! Get off! Get off!

547
01:08:41,707 --> 01:08:43,009
Why are you doing this?

548
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:48,715
Why not?

549
01:10:45,831 --> 01:10:49,400
Come on!

550
01:10:49,402 --> 01:10:51,869
Come on, please.
Come on, please.

551
01:10:51,871 --> 01:10:53,737
Please, I need you to go!

552
01:15:20,072 --> 01:15:22,338
Stop! Stop! Help!

553
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:24,107
Wait! Stop the car!

554
01:15:24,109 --> 01:15:26,377
Stop the car! Stop the car!

555
01:15:26,379 --> 01:15:28,081
Oh, thank God.

556
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:34,084
Hi. Hi.
Help me, please.

557
01:15:34,086 --> 01:15:36,020
- Are you okay?
- Please.

558
01:15:36,022 --> 01:15:37,420
Please. Wait.

559
01:15:37,422 --> 01:15:38,955
Wait.

560
01:15:38,957 --> 01:15:39,925
Wait.

561
01:15:44,630 --> 01:15:46,166
Drive!

562
01:17:52,157 --> 01:17:53,222
Hello.
