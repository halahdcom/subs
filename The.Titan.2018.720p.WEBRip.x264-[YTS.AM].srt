with a working population of 3,000 people.

00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:00,666
Got 20,000 acres of training fields.

11
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:04,875
We even have a supermarket,
a cinema, and a mall.

12
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:06,875
All under NATO command?

13
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:09,083
Joint initiative
with the Defense Science Office,

14
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,250
and the British Department
of Science and Technology, of course.

15
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,750
To be sure, Lieutenant,
we're highly classified.

16
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,500
Communication with the outside world
will be limited.

17
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,375
No different at Edwards or Dryden, sir.

[woman] <i>This whole street</i>
<i>is part of the new expansion.</i>

19
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,916
A total new-build.

20
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,250
I'm excited to show you.

[door beeps open]

22
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:35,666
Welcome.

23
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,416
There's two bedrooms upstairs.

24
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:46,625
The lights are motion-activated.

25
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:53,291
There's three bathrooms, a media room,
and an automated kitchen.

26
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,041
Hey, don't listen to Jim.

27
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,291
I mean, Colonel Peterson.

28
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:04,125
If you want to call friends and family,
feel free. We trust you.

29
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,625
Look, if you need anything, call me.
Day or night.

30
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:11,750
Thank you, Freya.

31
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,208
[boy] Mom, come look!

32
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,250
- Come on.
- Check this, hon.

00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:37,583
[laughs]

[smooches]

35
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,500
Which one are you going to?

36
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,666
You can't see it. You need a telescope.

37
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:49,958
But it's out there.

38
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,291
And you'll be there too someday.

39
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,541
Down, down, down.

40
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,166
- [grunts]
- [laughs]

41
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,958
Are you ready? Only got the one.

42
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,791
- Yeah.
- Careful.

43
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,583
[man speaking softly, indistinctly]

44
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:55,666
[boy] Okay.

45
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,208
[doorbell rings]

46
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:05,083
- Hi, Abigail. How was your trip?
- Professor Collingwood.

47
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,708
It is so good to see you.

48
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:14,458
You don't know how happy I was
to throw your Dryden test results

49
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,541
into NASA's face.

50
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,208
Absolutely incredible.

51
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,625
It's just an honor
to have been selected, sir.

52
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:23,438
I've been teaching the past years,
didn't think I still had it.

53
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,125
Don't call me "sir." I don't have a rank.

54
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,583
I'm just not gonna let you down.

55
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,791
I know how much this means to you, Rick.

56
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,041
But... pioneering isn't without its risks.

57
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,208
Yeah, well, first one through the wall
always gets a little bloody.

58
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,625
He's gonna get sick, isn't he?

59
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,291
Temporarily.

60
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,416
He'll need committed aftercare.

61
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:52,833
He won't seem himself at times.

62
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:58,125
Rick crossed the Syrian desert
injured and alone

63
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:01,041
without food or water for three days.

64
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,875
Well, this will make that look
like a walk in the park.

65
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:05,875
But we'll get through it.

66
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:10,625
Dr. Janssen, I admire your courage.

67
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:14,041
Rick wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you.

68
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:18,041
I want to tell you that I'm...
I'm grateful.

69
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,583
You don't have to charm me, Professor.

70
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,875
I've studied your work.
I know what we're doing.

71
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:25,583
It's bigger than all of us.

72
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,833
Yes, yes, yes. I know that, but it's...

73
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,875
It's the concessions you made.
The medical career.

74
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,208
The nights of worry.

75
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,708
It's a small price to pay
for my son's future.

76
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,458
No one attempts the impossible

77
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:49,375
without belief in something greater
than themselves.

78
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,708
Even if that something is a someone.

79
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,416
Rick didn't cross the desert alone.

80
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,000
[engine turns over]

81
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:19,125
[Collingwood] <i>Our population</i>
<i>has grown out of control.</i>

82
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,375
<i>Our environment is in decay.</i>

83
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,541
<i>Our resources have been depleted.</i>

84
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,541
<i>Wars have ravaged our planet.</i>

85
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,791
<i>We are fighting over the scraps
of what remains.</i>

86
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,416
<i>In ten years, half the planet
will be uninhabitable.</i>

87
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:49,958
<i>In 15 years, half the world's population
will have starved to death.</i>

88
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,416
Time is running out.

89
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,083
We've outgrown our home.

90
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:02,333
Our children will witness the end of days.

91
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:09,333
But there is one place that gives us hope.

92
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,083
Titan.

93
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:14,458
The largest moon of Saturn.

94
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:19,625
The only other place in our solar system
with an atmosphere.

95
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:26,333
A primordial ecosystem, just like Earth,
seconds before life was born.

96
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:30,583
Liquid methane raining
into huge oceans and lakes

97
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,041
that we can't swim in,

98
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:36,541
and an atmosphere rich in nitrogen
that we can't breathe.

99
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,000
Too cold to exist in.

100
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,583
Fiercely hostile to life as we know it.

101
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,791
Beyond the reach of space science,

102
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:49,750
but not modern genetics.

103
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:53,916
No longer trying
to reshape planets in our image...

104
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:58,875
but evolving humanity into the stars.

105
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:03,833
Imagine, with a few minor enhancements,

106
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:07,375
you could breathe the air,
swim in the waters,

107
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,083
and survive the cold.

108
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,416
What if Titan...

109
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,583
could become our home?

110
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:20,625
Dr. Hernandez,
I was waiting for you to object.

111
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:24,416
I still don't understand how our bodies
won't reject the treatment.

112
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,875
Clinical trials were successful,

113
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,291
signed off by NATO's
Science and Technology Office.

114
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:33,583
- You are talking forced evolution?
- I'm talking survival of the species.

115
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,333
HPA-axis reprogramming.

116
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,500
Methane lipid bilayer injections.

117
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:40,250
G-force training under water?

118
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,416
There are no guarantees, Dr. Hernandez.

119
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,375
Some people won't take to the drugs.

120
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:48,166
Some people will break
during the training.

121
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,583
Most of you will fail and be sent home.

122
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,041
How many of us will die?

123
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,541
Twenty bucks says Iker goes first.

124
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,333
Can you read?

125
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:58,291
What?

126
00:10:58,375 --> 00:10:59,958
I said can you read, idiot?

127
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,125
Because if you could,
you'd see that this book

128
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,625
is just a bunch of health warnings.

129
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,958
- Why are you here?
- I'm just pointing out...

130
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:09,333
You're pointing out nothing.
He's talking about the end of the Earth.

131
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,875
[sighs] You got kids?

132
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:13,416
No.

133
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,541
Shut the fuck up or get the fuck out.

134
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,000
Please. Go on, Professor.

135
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:24,458
I was sent 5,000 personnel files

136
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,916
<i>from 16 NATO countries.
I chose you, because in your past,</i>

137
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,958
<i>each of you has shown an ability</i>

138
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,500
<i>to survive the harshest of conditions.</i>

139
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,416
<i>Each of you is here,</i>

140
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,791
<i>because you understand the dire necessity</i>

141
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,375
of finding a new home for the human race.

142
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,625
Maybe you're mad,

143
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:48,083
ambitious, adventurous.

144
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:52,083
But each of you has a rare willingness
to put yourselves on the line

145
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,541
for the sake of others.

146
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:57,208
<i>My hope is, when we're finished,</i>

147
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:01,750
<i>all of you will be able to stand on Titan,</i>

148
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:05,041
<i>take a deep breath,
and swim in its waters.</i>

149
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,083
<i>Maybe soar through its skies.</i>

150
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:13,958
You will become enhanced humans.

151
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:15,750
Super men.

152
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,541
Able to live on another world.

153
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,083
<i>You'll become you...</i>

154
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:25,375
<i>but better.</i>

155
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,208
The slingshot around Jupiter
is 50-50 at best.

156
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,000
Not if you use a Hohmann Transfer.

157
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,708
All right, give me two minutes, guys.

158
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:40,750
You'd need propulsion of more
than 15 kilometers a second for that.

159
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:41,833
It's never been done.

160
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,375
Let's just worry about down here

Do you pray?

322
00:27:14,416 --> 00:27:16,541
I guess I don't pray as much as I should.

323
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:19,708
I pray.

324
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,833
I didn't wanna come here.

325
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:27,041
He's a corporal

326
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:29,708
in the United States Marines,
about to make sergeant.

327
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,208
Could have chosen his own station.

328
00:27:33,041 --> 00:27:36,291
He ain't got no business in space,
but I can't tell him that.

329
00:27:36,375 --> 00:27:37,375
Why not?

330
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:40,541
'Cause he'll get mad, call me chicken.

331
00:27:42,833 --> 00:27:45,583
Zane's here 'cause he has
a very important job to do.

332
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,041
He's giving us a chance.

333
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:52,500
And you're here because you love him.

334
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:59,125
And you want your kids to grow up
knowing that their father was a hero.

335
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,750
Dad!

336
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,916
[laughing]

337
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
[video game beeps]

338
00:28:21,625 --> 00:28:23,333
[Rick and son laughing]

339
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,208
[shivers]

340
00:29:14,583 --> 00:29:16,583
[air conditioning powers down]

341
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:39,458
What are you doing?

342
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:43,208
I was just hot.

343
00:29:45,291 --> 00:29:46,750
Why didn't you wake me up?

344
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:51,708
There's no point us both suffering.

345
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,875
Want me to make you
an ice bath or something?

346
00:29:54,958 --> 00:29:55,958
It's okay.

347
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:58,125
I'm okay.

348
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:27,916
- Go on.
- I don't wanna put my hands in there.

349
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:30,583
Go on. I wanna show you something.

350
00:30:37,541 --> 00:30:39,000
[laughs]

351
00:30:44,541 --> 00:30:45,833
Jeez!

352
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
It's so cold!

353
00:30:55,458 --> 00:30:58,208
What? Now what?

354
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:03,208
I don't feel any cold.

355
00:31:40,416 --> 00:31:42,000
[Rick] Let me show you something.

356
00:31:50,791 --> 00:31:51,958
It's beautiful.

357
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:54,458
It's a shame we can't save it.

358
00:32:16,041 --> 00:32:17,458
Doctor, be careful in there.

359
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:20,333
It's 20% liquid methane.

360
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:34,083
You okay?

361
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,750
Cold. Hurts.

362
00:33:38,541 --> 00:33:39,541
Then get out.

363
00:33:41,375 --> 00:33:42,375
No.

364
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:49,166
Mind over matter.

365
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,000
Hey, you guys losing any hair?

366
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:33,625
I don't think so.

367
00:34:33,708 --> 00:34:35,750
I'm not losing any hair.
Still looking handsome.

368
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:36,708
I lost some hair.

369
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:38,000
Like, two days ago.

370
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:41,041
- Here.
- Let me see.

371
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:45,500
Oh, shit. A souvenir for you.

372
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,125
He's got something.

373
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:49,166
[screaming]

374
00:34:51,875 --> 00:34:53,916
- Get up, get up, get up!
- What happened?

375
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,750
We were talking
and she started convulsing.

376
00:34:55,833 --> 00:34:57,000
- How long?
- Thirty seconds.

377
00:34:57,083 --> 00:34:58,458
- [screams]
- Stop! Get back!

378
00:34:58,541 --> 00:35:00,541
Okay, keep her still. Hold her.
Get the case!

379
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:05,041
Hey!

380
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:09,208
[Hernandez speaking Spanish]

381
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:11,208
Stay with us. Come on, come on.

382
00:35:11,291 --> 00:35:13,083
[Hernandez] Right now we're losing her!

383
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:17,625
[gasps]

384
00:35:40,833 --> 00:35:43,708
No, no, no, no, no.
The question is: who's next?

385
00:35:43,791 --> 00:35:46,208
They only need one or two
to prove the program.

386
00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:48,333
One or two?

387
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:51,708
No, we're going up there together...
as a team.

388
00:35:53,625 --> 00:35:55,500
I heard him say exactly the opposite.

389
00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:00,250
No, he said we're becoming titans,
and we're going to Titan.

390
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:01,833
And that's the mission.

391
00:36:01,916 --> 00:36:03,625
The program is the mission.

392
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:08,708
Nobody said we was gonna die.

393
00:36:12,708 --> 00:36:14,208
We all knew the risks.

394
00:36:20,208 --> 00:36:21,750
[door opens, closes]

395
00:36:29,541 --> 00:36:32,583
- You know we're not supposed to drink.
- Yeah, that was before.

396
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:38,708
Where were you stationed?

397
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:41,166
Syria.

398
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,500
[glasses clink]

399
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:43,625
Yeah, me too.

400
00:36:52,666 --> 00:36:54,000
You got family back home?

401
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:04,541
She was this bad-ass cadet
I used to see in the mess hall.

402
00:37:05,875 --> 00:37:08,958
I fell hopelessly in love with her.
I used to write her poetry.

403
00:37:09,916 --> 00:37:11,791
I had the worst lyrics.

404
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:17,333
Then one day when the war started,
they stationed her at Diego Garcia,

405
00:37:17,625 --> 00:37:19,333
and, um, she left.

406
00:37:19,416 --> 00:37:20,750
So what did you do?

407
00:37:20,833 --> 00:37:21,833
Um...

408
00:37:22,583 --> 00:37:24,333
I went and I found her.

409
00:37:26,541 --> 00:37:28,458
Now he wants to start a family.

410
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,833
But they changed the law,
so it doesn't matter now.

411
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:38,041
We can't have any kids without a permit,
and we can't get one here, so...

412
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:40,541
Rayenne, give us a hand, will you, love?

413
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:54,125
He thinks if I go and come back,
I'll have got it out of my system.

414
00:37:56,083 --> 00:37:57,666
Be the good wife.

415
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,083
I wouldn't have made it this far
without him.

416
00:38:17,333 --> 00:38:18,500
Well...

417
00:38:19,125 --> 00:38:20,125
Yeah.

418
00:38:21,875 --> 00:38:22,958
That's Rick.

419
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,625
[mouthing] Are you okay?

420
00:38:51,666 --> 00:38:53,458
No, no fucking way!

421
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:56,666
[yells]

422
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,583
No, back off!

423
00:38:58,666 --> 00:38:59,666
[grunting]

424
00:39:00,666 --> 00:39:02,875
- [grunting]
- No way!

425
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:05,333
- Calm down.
- No!

426
00:39:05,416 --> 00:39:07,500
Zane, calm down! That's an order!

427
00:39:07,583 --> 00:39:08,833
[screams]

428
00:39:08,916 --> 00:39:11,166
- Hey...
- We're here. We're here.

429
00:39:12,875 --> 00:39:14,541
- We got you.
- [groans]

430
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:23,250
Let him go. Let him go.

431
00:39:27,416 --> 00:39:28,500
Look at me.

432
00:39:29,708 --> 00:39:30,708
You're with us.

433
00:39:32,833 --> 00:39:34,166
You'll...

434
00:39:34,916 --> 00:39:35,916
make it.

435
00:39:51,666 --> 00:39:54,416
[Freya] Good. 121 over 96.

436
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,480
The spleen seems to be having trouble
processing the treatment,

437
00:39:57,541 --> 00:39:59,041
putting a burden on the kidneys.

438
00:39:59,125 --> 00:40:02,125
Is that what killed Dr. Ramos?
Was it a known risk?

439
00:40:03,166 --> 00:40:04,166
Yes and no.

440
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:06,375
Well, Captain Ramos
was predisposed to kidney stones,

441
00:40:06,458 --> 00:40:08,083
which caused the complication.

442
00:40:08,166 --> 00:40:09,250
I was there.

443
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,666
That wasn't the kidney stones.

444
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:13,750
Pills.

445
00:40:19,791 --> 00:40:20,791
May I?

446
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,830
The pills are Flunarizine,
a calcium-channel blocker.

447
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:29,041
This is potassium citrate.

448
00:40:29,125 --> 00:40:31,833
- Helps flush the kidneys.
- Potassium citrate's taken orally.

449
00:40:31,916 --> 00:40:34,708
But it's in magnesium sulfate
so it bypasses the gastric tract.

450
00:40:34,791 --> 00:40:36,125
- How much magnesium?
- Ten grams.

451
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:37,208
That's high.

452
00:40:40,291 --> 00:40:42,625
I'd like to speak
with Professor Collingwood.

453
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:45,125
Well, he's not here, so...

454
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:47,833
as soon as he's free,
I'll get him to come see you.

455
00:40:55,375 --> 00:40:56,541
All right.

456
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,125
[retching]

457
00:41:07,291 --> 00:41:08,583
I think that's it.

458
00:41:09,541 --> 00:41:10,708
[panting]

459
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:15,666
Mind over matter.

460
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:16,791
[inhales deeply]

461
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:18,125
[exhales]

462
00:45:03,458 --> 00:45:06,291
[Collingwood] Titan receives
much less light than Earth.

463
00:45:07,708 --> 00:45:10,875
By multiplying the rod cells
by up to eight times,

464
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,208
we change the aperture of the eye...

465
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:18,041
to more closely resemble
those of a feline.

466
00:45:19,625 --> 00:45:22,083
Allowing you to see through the darkness.

467
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:45,375
[exhales]

468
00:45:53,958 --> 00:45:56,000
- Peanut butter?
- Yeah. Jelly?

469
00:45:56,083 --> 00:45:57,083
Yeah.

470
00:46:06,333 --> 00:46:07,541
[Rick breathing heavily]

471
00:46:18,833 --> 00:46:20,541
[Rick continues breathing heavily]

472
00:46:21,375 --> 00:46:22,583
- [Abi] Baby?
- [Rick] Yeah.

473
00:46:22,666 --> 00:46:23,708
[grunts]

474
00:46:24,625 --> 00:46:25,625
[Abi] Rick?!

475
00:46:27,083 --> 00:46:28,083
Help!

476
00:46:29,208 --> 00:46:32,291
- I need somebody here right now!
- What happened?

477
00:46:32,375 --> 00:46:34,708
He started rubbing his eyes.
He was complaining of pain.

478
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:37,000
Lieutenant, let me see your eyes. Okay.

479
00:46:37,083 --> 00:46:39,875
Flush his eyes. Prep him.
Get him into surgery now.

480
00:46:39,958 --> 00:46:43,625
No, Mrs. Janssen, you have to stay here.
When we know something, we'll tell you.

481
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,208
- What did you do?
- Abi, please.

482
00:46:49,291 --> 00:46:50,750
He is blind!

483
00:46:50,833 --> 00:46:53,625
- That's only temporary.
- You did not tell me everything.

484
00:46:53,708 --> 00:46:56,583
Now, look. You're tired. Go home,

485
00:46:56,666 --> 00:46:59,291
There are cameras in our house.
I know you've been watching us.

486
00:46:59,375 --> 00:47:03,041
That was the Pentagon's idea.
It was for your security and ours.

487
00:47:03,125 --> 00:47:04,666
I argued against it at the time.

488
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:08,030
If you don't like it, I'll get rid of them.
There is something alive inside of him.

489
00:47:09,958 --> 00:47:12,166
Something that your fucking book
doesn't talk about.

490
00:47:12,916 --> 00:47:14,166
He is changing.

491
00:47:14,958 --> 00:47:17,500
I need to keep this under control.

492
00:47:17,583 --> 00:47:20,333
Rick needs me. Lucas needs you.

493
00:47:20,416 --> 00:47:22,541

Where is he?

[indistinct chatter in distance]

507
00:51:05,333 --> 00:51:08,666
With respect, Dr. Blake, you had your shot
at funding us and you blew it.

<i>Blew it? Are you nuts?
We want to shut you down.</i>

509

Anything now comes from envy
and resentment and is without merit.

510
00:51:15,375 --> 00:51:19,583
<i>What has no merit is your knee-jerk
program based on unproven science,</i>

You're so desperate to prove it, you won't admit you dove blindly...</i>

512
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:29,958
There's nothing blind here.
Either catch up, or stop holding me back.

<i>This isn't space research.</i>

This is NATO's call.

519
00:53:52,958 --> 00:53:54,541
NASA's just advising.

520
00:53:55,625 --> 00:53:56,958
Let's make it clear.

521
00:53:57,541 --> 00:53:59,458
I want this off my base.

522
00:54:00,375 --> 00:54:02,583
Well, then you better call
Field Marshall Howard at NATO

523
00:54:02,666 --> 00:54:04,750
or the Secretary of Defense
at the Pentagon

524
00:54:04,833 --> 00:54:06,583
because they own your base.

525
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:35,125
You need to look over Ramos's files.

526
00:54:35,208 --> 00:54:38,083
I have. It's a miracle we got this far.

527
00:54:38,166 --> 00:54:40,886
We have to stop and assess what we've got.
This wasn't in the trials.

528
00:54:40,916 --> 00:54:44,333
What we've got is a fucking roller coaster
of reputation and money.

529
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:47,333
It'll work...

530
00:54:48,541 --> 00:54:49,708
because it has to.

531
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:52,625
What if they all die?

532
00:54:59,291 --> 00:55:00,166
Okay.

533
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:01,291
Off you go.

Your sight will come back in 24 hours.

You will regain your vision
and much, much more.

But we miscalculated your brain's ability
to process your enhanced senses.

538
00:55:43,083 --> 00:55:45,333
Zane's brain just simply overloaded.

539
00:55:46,166 --> 00:55:48,000
- How do you fix it?
- It's surgery.

540
00:55:48,083 --> 00:55:49,500
That's not gonna happen.

541
00:55:49,583 --> 00:55:52,375
- Without it, Rick's brain will...
- Tell me the truth!

542
00:55:52,458 --> 00:55:54,333
- Stop it.
- No! No!

543
00:55:55,875 --> 00:55:57,166
I won't sit here,

544
00:55:57,250 --> 00:56:01,291
and watch him turn my husband
into a fucking animal!

545
00:56:08,625 --> 00:56:11,125
We are in uncharted waters, Abigail.

546
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:14,166
What are we actually doing here?

547
00:56:20,791 --> 00:56:24,458
During the first treatment,
we injected the subjects with an enzyme

548
00:56:25,375 --> 00:56:26,833
that could alter human DNA.

549
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:29,333
- You mean animal DNA?
- Well...

550
00:56:29,416 --> 00:56:33,875
He's giving you a name. Do you know that?
Calling them <i>Homo Titaniens</i>, right?

551
00:56:36,541 --> 00:56:38,458
It's a new species of man, yes.

552
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,125
[Abi] If these enzymes
are doing the work,

553
00:56:43,208 --> 00:56:44,208
how can you be sure

554
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:49,000
that his body doesn't just mutate
the eyes out altogether?

555
00:56:49,375 --> 00:56:52,375
Or develop membranes like a reptile?

556
00:56:53,125 --> 00:56:56,583
How can you possibly know
what he's becoming?

557
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:58,750
We don't know.

558
00:57:03,208 --> 00:57:06,458
Nature is unpredictable.
Everybody evolves in a different way.

559
00:57:08,583 --> 00:57:11,250
But I know for a fact

560
00:57:11,958 --> 00:57:15,166
that if Rick doesn't have surgery,

561
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:18,958
within 48 hours,
he will lose control of his emotions,

562
00:57:19,041 --> 00:57:21,916
and in 72 hours, he will be dead.

563
00:57:27,166 --> 00:57:30,250
All we can do is move forward...

564
00:57:32,291 --> 00:57:34,500
and hope and pray.

565
00:57:50,666 --> 00:57:52,916
You said the test results were successful.

566
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:56,416
I said not everybody would survive.

567
00:57:57,333 --> 00:57:58,333
You lied.

568
00:57:59,208 --> 00:58:01,666
I told you what you needed to know
at the time.

569
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:05,833
You said you would become you, but better.
That's what you said.

00:58:05,916 --> 00:58:07,375
And you will.

571
00:58:11,291 --> 00:58:13,041
I have more than hope in you, Rick.

572
00:58:16,375 --> 00:58:17,375

01:17:40,291 --> 01:17:41,958
He's now the future.

647
01:17:42,625 --> 01:17:45,333
And he's going to survive,
if we can help him.

648
01:17:45,416 --> 01:17:48,541
But we need to get him on Titan
so he can live.

649
01:17:49,875 --> 01:17:51,125
We need your help.

650
01:17:52,041 --> 01:17:55,000
If we force him, I fear we'll kill him.

651
01:17:56,708 --> 01:17:57,875
Do you understand?

652
01:18:07,416 --> 01:18:09,976
[Freya] We need to stabilize him first
or he's not gonna make it.

653
01:18:10,041 --> 01:18:11,881
The Pentagon's ordered
an immediate evacuation.

654
01:18:11,958 --> 01:18:15,125
- We have to stabilize him. His vitals...
- We have to leave now!

655
01:18:22,541 --> 01:18:24,958
Listen. Give me a minute, will you?

656
01:18:26,583 --> 01:18:27,583
Abigail...

657
01:18:30,291 --> 01:18:33,250
- If you can make him submit...
- Submit to what?

658
01:18:33,333 --> 01:18:37,000
If you can make him take one of these,

659
01:18:37,083 --> 01:18:39,541
you can end his suffering.

660
01:18:40,666 --> 01:18:44,333
This is a chemical lobotomy.
You'll erase all of his memories.

661
01:18:45,166 --> 01:18:46,458
He's resisting...

662
01:18:48,041 --> 01:18:51,458
because he's attached
to too many things on Earth.

663
01:18:52,916 --> 01:18:55,500
He won't remember who he is,
he won't remember who I am,

664
01:18:55,583 --> 01:18:57,333
he won't remember who his son is.

665
01:18:57,875 --> 01:19:00,083
What good would it do if he did?

666
01:19:06,125 --> 01:19:07,541
You know he can't stay here.

667
01:19:08,708 --> 01:19:09,708
He's a soldier.

668
01:19:10,291 --> 01:19:11,708
There's no going back.

669
01:19:45,541 --> 01:19:46,916
Be careful, Abigail.

670
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:06,250
Let's go. Trust me.

671
01:22:23,916 --> 01:22:25,416
No! No! Get out!

672
01:22:32,541 --> 01:22:33,708
[gunfire continues]

673
01:22:34,791 --> 01:22:36,375
[alarm sounds]

674
01:22:37,041 --> 01:22:38,208
What's going on?

675
01:22:39,708 --> 01:22:41,250
Oh, my God! You switched it!

676
01:23:03,458 --> 01:23:04,625
Hold it right there!

677
01:23:04,708 --> 01:23:05,708
[gunfire]

678
01:23:11,708 --> 01:23:12,708
Mom?

679
01:23:22,541 --> 01:23:24,708
There's another way out, through the lab.

680
01:23:50,791 --> 01:23:51,791
Dad?

681
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Dad!

682
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Rick!

683
01:24:05,333 --> 01:24:07,083
- Let's get you down.
- Okay.

684
01:24:09,208 --> 01:24:10,333
Be careful.

685
01:24:21,333 --> 01:24:22,375
Here's something.

686
01:24:42,833 --> 01:24:43,833
It's over, Abi.

687
01:24:44,916 --> 01:24:45,916
It's done with.

688
01:24:48,875 --> 01:24:49,958
They'll shoot...

689
01:24:51,416 --> 01:24:52,708
and kill your family.

690
01:24:53,666 --> 01:24:56,125
Just walk away with Lucas.

691
01:25:01,541 --> 01:25:02,791
Go fuck yourself.

692
01:25:14,625 --> 01:25:15,625
Shoot them.

693
01:25:16,791 --> 01:25:17,625
What?

694
01:25:17,708 --> 01:25:18,708
Shoot them!

695
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:24,750
No.

696
01:25:25,458 --> 01:25:28,291
No, I'm not shooting
two unarmed women and a child.

697
01:25:29,083 --> 01:25:30,833
Are you losing your minds?

698
01:25:32,583 --> 01:25:34,000
Look at what we've got!

699
01:25:34,416 --> 01:25:35,708
That's our research!

700
01:25:35,791 --> 01:25:37,458
That's what we bled for!

701
01:25:37,541 --> 01:25:38,666
I made him! I made him!

702
01:25:41,958 --> 01:25:43,791
But if we can't control him,

703
01:25:44,416 --> 01:25:45,708
all of us are dead.

704
01:25:46,541 --> 01:25:47,541
All of us.

705
01:27:54,791 --> 01:27:56,500
The crazy bastard did it.

706
01:27:58,458 --> 01:27:59,458
Yeah.

707
01:28:11,375 --> 01:28:13,000
Rick changes everything.

708
01:28:14,458 --> 01:28:15,625
He gives us hope.

709
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:19,375
Your family's a miracle, Dr. Janssen.

710
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,083
[door opens]

711
01:29:00,375 --> 01:29:01,375
[door closes]

712
01:29:08,375 --> 01:29:09,375
Hey, Mom.

713
01:29:09,916 --> 01:29:10,916
Hi.

714
01:29:12,458 --> 01:29:13,916
- How was school?
- It was great.

715
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,791
Come outside. It's so clear.

716
01:29:46,000 --> 01:30:46,000
