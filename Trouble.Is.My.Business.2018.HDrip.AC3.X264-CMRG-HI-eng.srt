00:01:39,422 --> 00:01:40,721
Take me to the cemetery.

5
00:01:40,723 --> 00:01:41,789
She's still alive.

6
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:42,890
This better be good.

7
00:01:42,892 --> 00:01:45,229
I wish I could say it was.

8
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,470
(dramatic orchestral music)

9
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:01,108
It started the other night, Lew.

10
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,944
I was alone in my office.

11
00:02:02,946 --> 00:02:06,148
Nothing in there seemed like
it belonged to me anymore

12
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,252
including me.

13
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,384
Goodnight, Drake

14
00:02:10,386 --> 00:02:12,589
It's a shame what happened.

15
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,360
(phone ringing)

16
00:02:26,302 --> 00:02:28,303
We're closed.

17
00:02:28,305 --> 00:02:30,207
[Woman] Roland Drake?

18
00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:33,375
Possibly.

19
00:02:33,377 --> 00:02:34,942
[Woman] I want to see you.

20
00:02:34,944 --> 00:02:36,611
Well pick up a
local gossip rag.

21
00:02:36,613 --> 00:02:37,545
You'll see plenty.

22
00:02:37,547 --> 00:02:38,879
[Woman] I do read the papers.

23
00:02:38,881 --> 00:02:40,148
I gathered you weren't
planning on being

24
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,116
a very busy man anymore.

25
00:02:42,118 --> 00:02:43,551
Nice.

26
00:02:43,553 --> 00:02:44,652
[Woman] That doesn't
change the fact that I need

27
00:02:44,654 --> 00:02:46,591
to see you... now.

28
00:02:46,924 --> 00:02:48,090
Come back tomorrow.

29
00:02:48,092 --> 00:02:49,724
I won't be busy then either.

30
00:02:49,726 --> 00:02:51,829
[Woman] I'm downstairs.

31
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,029
I said now.

32
00:02:54,031 --> 00:02:56,365
Well I can't say
no to a lady...

33
00:02:56,367 --> 00:02:57,035
(phone clicks)

34
00:02:59,369 --> 00:03:00,137
or you.

35
00:03:02,406 --> 00:03:04,372
[Roland Voiceover] I made a
feeble attempted to straighten

36
00:03:04,374 --> 00:03:09,411
things up for her, to hide
the inward chaos of my life

37
00:03:09,413 --> 00:03:12,583
before her shadow
eclipsed everything.

38
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:15,285
It's open.

39
00:03:16,386 --> 00:03:19,122
(dramatic music)

40
00:03:20,557 --> 00:03:23,057
Never thought you'd save me?

41
00:03:23,059 --> 00:03:25,092
Give me time.

42
00:03:25,094 --> 00:03:28,263
Looks like you
only have 30 days.

43
00:03:28,265 --> 00:03:31,836
All right so how can
I help you missus...

44
00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:34,404
Miss Montemar.

45
00:03:39,976 --> 00:03:41,310
Of course.

46
00:03:41,312 --> 00:03:42,510
[Roland Voiceover]
She had a face

47
00:03:42,512 --> 00:03:45,212
that would launch
1,000 ships and a body

48
00:03:45,214 --> 00:03:47,049
that would bring them back.

49
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:49,283
You mentioned needing saving.

50
00:03:49,285 --> 00:03:51,085
Sadly it's not coincidence
that I've come to you,

51
00:03:51,087 --> 00:03:52,554
Mr. Drake.

52
00:03:52,556 --> 00:03:54,855
I didn't think that
this was a happy accident.

53
00:03:54,857 --> 00:03:56,091
Wise ass.

54
00:03:56,093 --> 00:03:57,325
Wait till you get to
know the rest of me.

55
00:03:57,327 --> 00:03:58,592
I'm not here to get
to know the rest of you.

56
00:03:58,594 --> 00:04:00,127
Pity.

57
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:00,795
[Miss Montemar] I'm here
to find out what happened

58
00:04:00,797 --> 00:04:01,462
to my father.

59
00:04:01,464 --> 00:04:02,730
Montemar?

60
00:04:02,732 --> 00:04:03,764
Didn't I read something
about him going missing

61
00:04:03,766 --> 00:04:05,266
in the papers last week?

62
00:04:05,268 --> 00:04:07,369
I think my entire family's
in danger, Mr. Drake.

63
00:04:07,371 --> 00:04:08,203
Who do you think did it?

64
00:04:08,205 --> 00:04:09,738
I don't know.

65
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,039
Oh come on, Miss Montemar,
we both read the papers.

66
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,908
I don't believe the
story you're selling,

67
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,310
so why don't you just
take it to the cops.

68
00:04:15,312 --> 00:04:16,544
He's missing.

69
00:04:16,546 --> 00:04:17,813
I don't know that
he's been murdered.

70
00:04:17,815 --> 00:04:19,414
And, the cops, yes,
they were very nice.

71
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:20,782
First time for anything.

72
00:04:20,784 --> 00:04:22,383
They took his name
down, told me to call

73
00:04:22,385 --> 00:04:23,585
if I heard from him.

74
00:04:23,587 --> 00:04:25,020
Real helpful.

75
00:04:25,022 --> 00:04:26,520
Well you want some
more real helpful advice?

76
00:04:26,522 --> 00:04:28,556
You know from the papers
that missing persons cases

77
00:04:28,558 --> 00:04:30,827
and me don't mix real well.

78
00:04:32,363 --> 00:04:34,429
I don't play the
fool for anybody.

79
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,267
I'd like my desk back.

80
00:04:40,303 --> 00:04:42,003
Wait.

81
00:04:42,005 --> 00:04:43,838
(dramatic music)

82
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,575
Wait a week and call.

83
00:04:47,977 --> 00:04:50,611
I can't wait a week.

84
00:04:50,613 --> 00:04:53,614
My uncle's gone missing now too.

85
00:04:53,616 --> 00:04:55,015
I'm not that guy.

86
00:04:55,017 --> 00:04:56,184
I'm not the guy in the papers.

87
00:04:56,186 --> 00:04:57,551
I wouldn't let anything
happen to anyone.

88
00:04:57,553 --> 00:04:59,821
I knew you weren't.

89
00:04:59,823 --> 00:05:00,789
Please.

90
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:03,561
(dramatic music)

91
00:05:05,962 --> 00:05:07,130
Miss Montemar.

92
00:05:08,498 --> 00:05:09,499
Katherine.

93
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,535
I'm sorry this
happened to you.

94
00:05:13,537 --> 00:05:15,236
I don't want sorry.

95
00:05:15,238 --> 00:05:16,772
I want solved.

96
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,140
And, unless they find a body,
my father's never going to be

97
00:05:18,142 --> 00:05:20,642
considered dead
which is why I want

98
00:05:20,644 --> 00:05:24,816
more than his name in a list
and a phone call in a week.

99
00:05:26,849 --> 00:05:29,583
Mr. Drake, in the papers,
you said that you were

100
00:05:29,585 --> 00:05:33,023
the best missing
persons man in the city.

101
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,292
Are you the best?

102
00:05:36,527 --> 00:05:37,428
Find out.

103
00:05:40,063 --> 00:05:42,397
So how does this work?

104
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:45,232
It's working right now.

105
00:05:45,234 --> 00:05:46,136
Shall we?

106
00:05:49,705 --> 00:05:51,172
Yeah I think we
should probably start

107
00:05:51,174 --> 00:05:53,508
with how he went missing.

108
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,342
Dinner.

109
00:05:54,344 --> 00:05:55,844
Okay.

110
00:05:55,846 --> 00:05:58,112
No, my father and I were
supposed to have dinner

111
00:05:58,114 --> 00:05:59,246
at home.

112
00:05:59,248 --> 00:06:01,782
Oh, you still live at home?

113
00:06:01,784 --> 00:06:03,785
Yes Mr. Drake,
I'm not married.

114
00:06:03,787 --> 00:06:04,621
Oh good.

115
00:06:05,988 --> 00:06:07,121
Why what does that
have to do with anything?

116
00:06:07,123 --> 00:06:08,924
Nothing, that's for me.

117
00:06:08,926 --> 00:06:11,325
So I take it dad never showed?

118
00:06:11,327 --> 00:06:14,962
No, we haven't seen
him since Tuesday.

119
00:06:14,964 --> 00:06:18,301
Does dad have a
habit of disappearing?

120
00:06:20,404 --> 00:06:23,705
(dramatic music)

121
00:06:23,707 --> 00:06:25,172
I don't know what kind
of people you're accustomed

122
00:06:25,174 --> 00:06:26,575
to dealing with,
Mr. Drake, but we're

123
00:06:26,577 --> 00:06:27,912
a normal family.

124
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:30,778
We're the victims here.

125
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,580
Usually the victim
knows the assailant.

126
00:06:32,582 --> 00:06:33,881
The assailant feels justified.

127
00:06:33,883 --> 00:06:35,650
So I have to ask this question

128
00:06:35,652 --> 00:06:38,787
how did your family become
rich, Miss Montemar?

129
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:42,657
I am suddenly very sure
of one thing, Mr. Drake,

130
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:46,427
I don't have the
best man for the job.

131
00:06:46,429 --> 00:06:48,996
Yeah, there's one
thing you've forgotten.

132
00:06:48,998 --> 00:06:50,799
Oh really?

133
00:06:50,801 --> 00:06:51,635
Do tell.

134
00:06:54,003 --> 00:06:55,804
How would it look with
pieces of your clothing

135
00:06:55,806 --> 00:06:57,375
all over my office?

136
00:07:00,277 --> 00:07:02,710
Well you're the dective.

137
00:07:02,712 --> 00:07:04,145
You tell me.

138
00:07:04,147 --> 00:07:07,084
(thunder crashing)

139
00:07:09,352 --> 00:07:11,521
(moaning)

140
00:07:13,155 --> 00:07:15,892
(dramatic music)

141
00:07:20,097 --> 00:07:22,265
(moaning)

142
00:07:23,534 --> 00:07:25,702
(gasping)

143
00:07:31,575 --> 00:07:34,412
(heavy breathing)

144
00:07:36,246 --> 00:07:39,015
(dramatic music)

145
00:07:43,085 --> 00:07:45,255
(moaning)

146
00:07:48,724 --> 00:07:51,395
(ominous music)

147
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,600
(knocking)

148
00:07:59,602 --> 00:08:02,236
(ominous music)

149
00:08:02,238 --> 00:08:04,508
(knocking)

150
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,159
So you gonna invite me in?

151
00:08:24,161 --> 00:08:25,594
Actually I'm right
in the middle of...

152
00:08:25,596 --> 00:08:28,095
Hey, hate the DA not me.

153
00:08:28,097 --> 00:08:29,965
You didn't listen to me.

154
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,700
Yeah MacDonald, I
appreciate what you...

155
00:08:32,702 --> 00:08:34,469
Up kind of late again?

156
00:08:34,471 --> 00:08:36,870
Yeah actually I
was just waking up.

157
00:08:36,872 --> 00:08:41,609
Well I know you're going
through a hard patch, buddy.

158
00:08:41,611 --> 00:08:43,110
It's okay.

159
00:08:43,112 --> 00:08:45,980
Actually things have started
to pick up since you left.

160
00:08:45,982 --> 00:08:50,951
Well you made me too good
a detective to believe that.

161
00:08:50,953 --> 00:08:52,821
I can't believe the
newspapers are making

162
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:55,623
such a stew about
that missing girl.

163
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:59,226
You'd think that
you'd kidnapped her.

164
00:08:59,228 --> 00:09:02,663
Yeah, well I appreciate
you backing me up.

165
00:09:02,665 --> 00:09:03,600
Oh I see.

166
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:09,874
Well I didn't know
you weren't alone.

167
00:09:12,275 --> 00:09:13,774
(sniffing)

168
00:09:13,776 --> 00:09:14,908
Anyone you know?

169
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:15,877
I'm alone.

170
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:17,646
I wanna be alone.

171
00:09:17,648 --> 00:09:18,749
Okay, sure.

172
00:09:19,915 --> 00:09:20,882
Can I use your bathroom?

173
00:09:20,884 --> 00:09:21,719
No.

174
00:09:22,653 --> 00:09:23,654
All right.

175
00:09:31,595 --> 00:09:34,295
This came for you at my office.

176
00:09:34,297 --> 00:09:36,364
If you could take
care of your half,

177
00:09:36,366 --> 00:09:37,831
well I'd appreciate it.

178
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,968
Here let me take it.

179
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,604
Hope you get things
straightened out, my friend.

180
00:09:42,606 --> 00:09:47,075
Like I said, I just need
some time to get on my feet.

181
00:09:47,077 --> 00:09:48,643
You take care of yourself.

182
00:09:48,645 --> 00:09:51,579
(phone ringing)

183
00:09:51,581 --> 00:09:53,715
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

184
00:09:53,717 --> 00:09:56,386
(phone ringing)

185
00:10:00,256 --> 00:10:01,623
[Woman] Roland Drake?

186
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:02,623
Possibly.

187
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:05,125
[Woman] I need to see you.

188
00:10:05,127 --> 00:10:07,327
Katherine, what's going on?

189
00:10:07,329 --> 00:10:08,595
[Woman] I need to see you.

190
00:10:08,597 --> 00:10:10,098
Can we meet at your office?

191
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,066
Yeah no, I'm not gonna be
in the office today actually.

192
00:10:12,068 --> 00:10:13,236
[Woman] Now.

193
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:15,505
Yeah, oh yeah.

194
00:10:17,573 --> 00:10:18,409
Right.

195
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,550
You see Lew, business
is picking up already.

196
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,651
Of course it is.

197
00:10:29,653 --> 00:10:33,654
You might want to
get your door fixed.

198
00:10:33,656 --> 00:10:35,592
Someone might break in.

199
00:10:38,694 --> 00:10:40,461
[Roland Voiceover] Lew,
after I watched you walk away,

200
00:10:40,463 --> 00:10:42,763
I went over my place
again and again.

201
00:10:42,765 --> 00:10:46,133
How did this happen,
and I never woke up?

202
00:10:46,135 --> 00:10:48,268
With every passing
minute, I was feeling

203
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,537
like it happened in a
dream, like I'd fallen

204
00:10:50,539 --> 00:10:51,541
for a ghost.

205
00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:55,744
I needed to get back to the
only place I could think.

206
00:10:55,746 --> 00:10:58,481
(dramatic music)

207
00:11:16,265 --> 00:11:18,769
(tense music)

208
00:11:30,347 --> 00:11:31,779
(pencil clattering)

209
00:11:31,781 --> 00:11:34,748
I caught a whiff of perfume
like sweet temptation.

210
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,218
Last thing I needed.

211
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,620
Sorry I'm closed.

212
00:11:39,622 --> 00:11:41,122
Actually I'm expecting someone.

213
00:11:41,124 --> 00:11:44,558
[Blonde Woman] More correctly,
you were expecting me.

214
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,062
No, no I wasn't.

215
00:11:47,597 --> 00:11:49,330
Who are you?

216
00:11:49,332 --> 00:11:50,864
I'm scared, Mr. Drake.

217
00:11:50,866 --> 00:11:52,032
Why?

218
00:11:52,034 --> 00:11:53,534
I'm Jennifer.

219
00:11:53,536 --> 00:11:55,202
Why the gun?

220
00:11:55,204 --> 00:11:57,705
Katherine's sister.

221
00:11:57,707 --> 00:12:00,477
(dramatic music)

222
00:12:01,944 --> 00:12:03,344
Katherine?

223
00:12:03,346 --> 00:12:04,979
Don't you make a habit
of remembering the names

224
00:12:04,981 --> 00:12:06,848
of the ladies that come to you?

225
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,316
I remember if it's business.

226
00:12:09,318 --> 00:12:11,686
Well then I'm surprised
you don't remember Katherine.

227
00:12:11,688 --> 00:12:15,123
I expect you gave her quit
the business last night.

228
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,425
Look why are you here?

229
00:12:17,427 --> 00:12:19,761
I'm here to find out
what you did to my sister.

230
00:12:19,763 --> 00:12:21,396
Now are you gonna help me
or are you just sticking

231
00:12:21,398 --> 00:12:22,763
your nose where
it doesn't belong?

232
00:12:22,765 --> 00:12:23,697
Look lady...

233
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:25,899
Or is nose off the mark?

234
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:28,469
How can I help you, sister?

235
00:12:28,471 --> 00:12:31,940
You are still a detective
after all, aren't you Mr. Drake?

236
00:12:31,942 --> 00:12:33,106
I mean perhaps not
a very good one.

237
00:12:33,108 --> 00:12:35,542
Let's see remembering
things would be

238
00:12:35,544 --> 00:12:37,380
a minimum requirement.

239
00:12:40,015 --> 00:12:43,250
Do you remember my name,
or have I given you

240
00:12:43,252 --> 00:12:45,021
enough to go on, huh?

241
00:12:48,858 --> 00:12:51,658
I remember if it's
important, Jennifer.

242
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,229
That's my business.

243
00:12:54,364 --> 00:12:55,997
And, I remain too much
of a lady to inquire

244
00:12:55,999 --> 00:12:59,133
what you do remember
about Katherine.

245
00:12:59,135 --> 00:13:02,237
She came her last
night, didn't she?

246
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,073
She did.

247
00:13:03,939 --> 00:13:06,007
It was before closing.

248
00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:08,178
Yeah, now she's missing.

249
00:13:09,545 --> 00:13:12,046
People in my family
are missing, Mr. Drake.

250
00:13:12,048 --> 00:13:13,116
Where is she?

251
00:13:14,217 --> 00:13:15,215
Where is she?

252
00:13:15,217 --> 00:13:18,418
What did you do to my sister?

253
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,924
Beyond the obvious, nothing.

254
00:13:22,058 --> 00:13:23,561
Don't lie to me!

255
00:13:24,928 --> 00:13:28,599
Please Mr. Drake, my entire
life is disappearing.

256
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,399
If my father is dead,
then Katherine stands

257
00:13:32,401 --> 00:13:35,869
to inherit my entire
family fortune.

258
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:38,005
Now I can't find Katherine.

259
00:13:38,007 --> 00:13:39,576
That makes me next.

260
00:13:41,544 --> 00:13:44,711
All right, that
I will remember.

261
00:13:44,713 --> 00:13:46,214
And, then I wake
up this morning,

262
00:13:46,216 --> 00:13:49,783
and I see this envelope full
of pictures of the two of you.

263
00:13:49,785 --> 00:13:51,819
Yeah, real nice.

264
00:13:51,821 --> 00:13:53,553
I want to know what's
going on right now!

265
00:13:53,555 --> 00:13:54,622
All right, calm down!

266
00:13:54,624 --> 00:13:56,090
Those guns go off.

267
00:13:56,092 --> 00:13:57,191
You want to sit down?

268
00:13:57,193 --> 00:13:58,125
No.

269
00:13:58,127 --> 00:13:59,860
I'd like to call the police now.

270
00:13:59,862 --> 00:14:00,795
Fine.

271
00:14:00,797 --> 00:14:02,430
You know what after last night,

272
00:14:02,432 --> 00:14:05,667
I feel like I was
practically in your family.

273
00:14:05,669 --> 00:14:07,270
I like your family.

274
00:14:08,404 --> 00:14:10,470
Your sister came to me.

275
00:14:10,472 --> 00:14:12,572
I'm not so sure about that.

276
00:14:12,574 --> 00:14:15,008
Why don't we call the police
now, and we'll just all

277
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:17,644
look at these pictures
together, okay?

278
00:14:17,646 --> 00:14:18,680
Fine, why don't we do that?

279
00:14:18,682 --> 00:14:19,513
Good.

280
00:14:19,515 --> 00:14:21,081
(clattering)

281
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,853
(dramatic music)

282
00:14:24,888 --> 00:14:27,124
(grunting)

283
00:14:32,728 --> 00:14:36,400
What are you gonna do
to me know, Mr. Drake?

284
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,504
Unfortunately I'm
gonna go to plan B.

285
00:14:41,938 --> 00:14:44,806
I'm gonna offer you a seat
and a chance to listen.

286
00:14:44,808 --> 00:14:47,544
(dramatic music)

287
00:15:05,562 --> 00:15:07,095
Well it seems you have
more than just a professional

288
00:15:07,097 --> 00:15:11,965
interest in missing persons
cases, don't you detective?

289
00:15:11,967 --> 00:15:14,671
(dramatic music)

290
00:15:16,106 --> 00:15:18,138
I don't get it.

291
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,273
Someone wants you
to think something.

292
00:15:20,275 --> 00:15:24,345
But, that somebody thought
they had an airtight frame,

293
00:15:24,347 --> 00:15:26,714
they would've sent these
things to the cops,

294
00:15:26,716 --> 00:15:29,017
not to you in the morning.

295
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:30,254
I'm disarmed.

296
00:15:31,453 --> 00:15:34,022
I guess now I have to
take your word for it.

297
00:15:34,024 --> 00:15:37,492
Look you've got the
wrong idea about me.

298
00:15:37,494 --> 00:15:38,329
Oh do I?

299
00:15:39,228 --> 00:15:40,427
Good.

300
00:15:40,429 --> 00:15:41,896
Because I would
really like to know

301
00:15:41,898 --> 00:15:45,633
what do you think
is going on here?

302
00:15:45,635 --> 00:15:49,003
I want to find out what
happened to Katherine.

303
00:15:49,005 --> 00:15:52,507
I just don't want to get
involved in it with you.

304
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:55,575
You don't get involved
in this with me now,

305
00:15:55,577 --> 00:15:58,012
and I make sure all of these
photos go to the police.

306
00:15:58,014 --> 00:16:00,547
And, given your current
reputation, oh yeah.

307
00:16:00,549 --> 00:16:02,617
All right fine.

308
00:16:02,619 --> 00:16:04,855
We're in business together.

309
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:09,891
I normally make $35 a day.

310
00:16:09,893 --> 00:16:11,691
We'll have to talk about that.

311
00:16:11,693 --> 00:16:14,228
Yeah, well we're need
to talk about the jewelry.

312
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,466
What jewelry?

313
00:16:19,903 --> 00:16:23,671
Come on, dumb's the one
thing that does't look good

314
00:16:23,673 --> 00:16:25,105
on you.

315
00:16:25,107 --> 00:16:27,075
We both know that the
jewelry had something to do

316
00:16:27,077 --> 00:16:28,475
with this case.

317
00:16:28,477 --> 00:16:30,912
What do you know
about the diamond?

318
00:16:30,914 --> 00:16:33,648
The gem was one of the
things that came up last night.

319
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,649
It's so valuable how come
everyone in the world

320
00:16:35,651 --> 00:16:37,118
isn't looking for it?

321
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,220
My father brought
it back secretly,

322
00:16:39,222 --> 00:16:41,189
so only those of us in
the family even know

323
00:16:41,191 --> 00:16:43,157
we need to be looking for it.

324
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:45,593
It could be very dangerous
for those that do know.

325
00:16:45,595 --> 00:16:48,495
Well I'm being very
selective, Mr. Drake.

326
00:16:48,497 --> 00:16:50,364
I always get picked
for the good stuff.

327
00:16:50,366 --> 00:16:51,666
(smacking)

328
00:16:51,668 --> 00:16:53,468
(tense music)

329
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,739
(grunting)

330
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,041
(bashing)

331
00:17:00,043 --> 00:17:01,008
Selective?

332
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,210
Who's this?

333
00:17:02,212 --> 00:17:04,645
I've never seen him
before in my life!

334
00:17:04,647 --> 00:17:06,848
(smacking)

335
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:09,783
(grunting)

336
00:17:09,785 --> 00:17:13,020
(dramatic music)

337
00:17:13,022 --> 00:17:14,187
Who are you?

338
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:15,990
(gargling blood)

339
00:17:15,992 --> 00:17:17,591
What do you want?

340
00:17:17,593 --> 00:17:18,626
Who are you?

341
00:17:18,628 --> 00:17:19,459
(choking)

342
00:17:19,461 --> 00:17:22,330
(gun firing)

343
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:25,832
He was gonna, I
thought he might stab.

344
00:17:25,834 --> 00:17:28,034
Oh my God, is he dead?

345
00:17:28,036 --> 00:17:30,437
Yes, thanks to you.

346
00:17:30,439 --> 00:17:34,774
Now that gun shot's not
gonna go unnoticed for long.

347
00:17:34,776 --> 00:17:38,446
Are you sure you
don't recognize him?

348
00:17:38,448 --> 00:17:40,080
I don't know him.

349
00:17:40,082 --> 00:17:42,349
Well he seems to know you,
and somebody slit his throat

350
00:17:42,351 --> 00:17:44,385
and didn't finish the job.

351
00:17:44,387 --> 00:17:46,253
A dying assassin?

352
00:17:46,255 --> 00:17:49,823
Maybe he found me
because of Katherine.

353
00:17:49,825 --> 00:17:51,391
(door rattling)

354
00:17:51,393 --> 00:17:53,360
Hey Drake, you
all right in there?

355
00:17:53,362 --> 00:17:55,061
We heard something.

356
00:17:55,063 --> 00:17:56,531
- We're fine.
- We're fine.

357
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:59,035
(tense music)

358
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:03,003
There's nothing in his
pocket except a matchbook

359
00:18:03,005 --> 00:18:04,772
from the Wiltmore Hotel.

360
00:18:04,774 --> 00:18:05,740
This mean anything to you?

361
00:18:05,742 --> 00:18:07,675
No, I wish it did.

362
00:18:07,677 --> 00:18:10,043
Jennifer, this is murder.

363
00:18:10,045 --> 00:18:11,779
Oh if we're gonna have
to talk about murder,

364
00:18:11,781 --> 00:18:13,246
then maybe we're gonna
have to tell the police

365
00:18:13,248 --> 00:18:15,849
how you were with my missing
sister all last night,

366
00:18:15,851 --> 00:18:17,251
and that I have pictures.

367
00:18:17,253 --> 00:18:18,819
The police are gonna love you.

368
00:18:18,821 --> 00:18:19,853
I don't need love.

369
00:18:19,855 --> 00:18:21,589
I need help.

370
00:18:21,591 --> 00:18:23,456
Claude, are you still there?

371
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,626
[Claude] Yeah,
but you got company.

372
00:18:25,628 --> 00:18:27,427
I'm just trying to
help a lady out here.

373
00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:29,397
Something fell.

374
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,032
[Claude] All right
it's nothing folks.

375
00:18:31,034 --> 00:18:32,699
Something fell.

376
00:18:32,701 --> 00:18:33,935
Lots of blood.

377
00:18:33,937 --> 00:18:35,302
Don't worry about
it, I'm being evicted.

378
00:18:35,304 --> 00:18:36,236
No.

379
00:18:36,238 --> 00:18:38,472
Okay get that rug.

380
00:18:38,474 --> 00:18:39,907
He's bleeding everywhere.

381
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:41,078
I'll get it.

382
00:18:46,783 --> 00:18:48,049
Just keep talking.

383
00:18:48,051 --> 00:18:49,884
Let him wonder what
happened in there.

384
00:18:49,886 --> 00:18:51,752
I see you like a
little innuendo.

385
00:18:51,754 --> 00:18:53,420
Well not a little one.

386
00:18:53,422 --> 00:18:54,589
I'm gonna need
some more information

387
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,090
about the diamond.

388
00:18:56,092 --> 00:18:58,091
I know a place we can talk,
and the food's survivable.

389
00:18:58,093 --> 00:19:00,594
Are you asking me to
lunch at a time like this?

390
00:19:00,596 --> 00:19:02,964
Yes, and since you're
paying me 35 a day,

391
00:19:02,966 --> 00:19:04,031
it's on you.

392
00:19:04,033 --> 00:19:05,299
Your pick.

393
00:19:05,301 --> 00:19:07,435
Well I do know a place
within walking distance.

394
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:10,071
But, are you
familiar with Orlov?

395
00:19:10,073 --> 00:19:11,408
No, good food?

396
00:19:12,574 --> 00:19:15,609
And, then in the
1700s it was stolen.

397
00:19:15,611 --> 00:19:18,378
It was later passed
down to a Russian count,

398
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:21,581
Gregory Orlov, and
he was a paramour

399
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:24,452
of the legendary empress
Catherine the Great.

400
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:27,420
He was using the diamond
to try to win her love.

401
00:19:27,422 --> 00:19:29,924
But no, not even with
the purest of diamonds.

402
00:19:29,926 --> 00:19:32,627
Who else found out
what it was worth?

403
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,628
Well a lot of people
know what it's worth.

404
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:37,031
Napoleon himself
tried to find it.

405
00:19:37,033 --> 00:19:39,567
But, his armies were
warned by a ghost

406
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:40,834
that there would
be consequences.

407
00:19:40,836 --> 00:19:42,770
No, I meant who found
out what it's worth

408
00:19:42,772 --> 00:19:43,941
more recently?

409
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,475
More recently there was
this pair of Russian twins

410
00:19:48,477 --> 00:19:52,413
who lept to their deaths
after possessing it.

411
00:19:52,415 --> 00:19:53,914
And, my father, he's
not the kind of man

412
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:56,617
that believes in cures, but
even he was gonna have it

413
00:19:56,619 --> 00:19:58,852
recut, and then he disappeared.

414
00:19:58,854 --> 00:20:00,721
[Roland] How did your
father get the diamond?

415
00:20:00,723 --> 00:20:01,988
I don't know.

416
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,291
Worth a look.

417
00:20:03,293 --> 00:20:05,559
We can find out
how he got it here.

418
00:20:05,561 --> 00:20:07,528
Maybe we find out who
else knows about it.

419
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:09,933
And, how soon can you pay me?

420
00:20:10,967 --> 00:20:11,968
Mr. Drake?

421
00:20:12,968 --> 00:20:14,267
Yeah.

422
00:20:14,269 --> 00:20:15,669
For you.

423
00:20:15,671 --> 00:20:18,441
(dramatic music)

424
00:20:20,376 --> 00:20:22,142
Where's my tip?

425
00:20:22,144 --> 00:20:23,980
Eat your vegetables.

426
00:20:26,381 --> 00:20:28,416
What was that?

427
00:20:28,418 --> 00:20:30,150
Another ghost.

428
00:20:30,152 --> 00:20:30,984
What?

429
00:20:30,986 --> 00:20:32,186
Never mind.

430
00:20:32,188 --> 00:20:33,853
Now with a diamond
like that, it requires

431
00:20:33,855 --> 00:20:35,055
a big operator.

432
00:20:35,057 --> 00:20:36,122
It's not the kind of
thing that you can sell

433
00:20:36,124 --> 00:20:37,657
on the open market.

434
00:20:37,659 --> 00:20:39,159
I know.

435
00:20:39,161 --> 00:20:40,194
And, that's why I'm worried
about what's gonna happen

436
00:20:40,196 --> 00:20:41,561
to the rest of my family.

437
00:20:41,563 --> 00:20:43,230
Your father was
an archeologist,

438
00:20:43,232 --> 00:20:46,233
so why didn't he just
give it to a museum?

439
00:20:46,235 --> 00:20:48,903
Well for all I know,
he was planning on it.

440
00:20:48,905 --> 00:20:49,973
I don't know.

441
00:20:51,207 --> 00:20:53,374
He was on the board
of several museums.

442
00:20:53,376 --> 00:20:54,908
A diamond like
this is gonna attract

443
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,409
the wrong kind of attention
no matter what your family

444
00:20:56,411 --> 00:20:58,314
tries to keep a secret.

445
00:20:59,614 --> 00:21:01,148
Now you mentioned
that Katherine was set

446
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:03,717
to inherit all of
your family fortune.

447
00:21:03,719 --> 00:21:05,119
Why don't you get half?

448
00:21:05,121 --> 00:21:07,355
(laughing)

449
00:21:07,357 --> 00:21:10,427
Come to dinner
tonight, you'll see.

450
00:21:12,294 --> 00:21:14,928
You know I didn't hurt her.

451
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,696
You remind me of her.

452
00:21:16,698 --> 00:21:18,435
Well we're sisters.

453
00:21:19,835 --> 00:21:23,771
Look Mr. Drake, I'm not ready
to turn you in just yet,

454
00:21:23,773 --> 00:21:25,638
just arrive at seven.

455
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,708
If you hear from Katherine,
will you let me know?

456
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:29,976
Of course.

457
00:21:29,978 --> 00:21:32,716
(dramatic music)

458
00:21:39,889 --> 00:21:41,355
I got it.

459
00:21:41,357 --> 00:21:42,923
You're broke.

460
00:21:42,925 --> 00:21:45,859
$1.47, still got an
eye for detail, Lew.

461
00:21:45,861 --> 00:21:47,093
You trained me well.

462
00:21:47,095 --> 00:21:48,928
We spent a lot of
years together.

463
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:50,430
Who's the girl?

464
00:21:50,432 --> 00:21:51,965
Potential client, like
I said things are starting

465
00:21:51,967 --> 00:21:53,466
to pick up.

466
00:21:53,468 --> 00:21:55,069
Is that the girl that was
in your apartment last night?

467
00:21:55,071 --> 00:21:55,903
No.

468
00:21:55,905 --> 00:21:57,237
Busy man.

469
00:21:57,239 --> 00:21:58,773
Where's that one?

470
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:01,111
I saw the state you were in.

471
00:22:02,611 --> 00:22:05,612
A needle mark in your arm,
I got a tip for you buddy.

472
00:22:05,614 --> 00:22:07,080
I can't cover for
you the way I did

473
00:22:07,082 --> 00:22:08,919
with the missing girl.

474
00:22:10,986 --> 00:22:12,852
And, I think someone's onto you.

475
00:22:12,854 --> 00:22:15,523
You didn't need
to cover for me.

476
00:22:15,525 --> 00:22:17,757
That was the whole problem.

477
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:19,894
Just trying to help.

478
00:22:19,896 --> 00:22:21,028
Need any help now?

479
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,396
Just a $1.47.

480
00:22:22,398 --> 00:22:24,165
Plus the tip?

481
00:22:24,167 --> 00:22:25,565
All in the details.

482
00:22:25,567 --> 00:22:29,403
Perhaps that's why
Jennifer Montemar hired you.

483
00:22:29,405 --> 00:22:30,905
You're a detail man.

484
00:22:30,907 --> 00:22:33,643
(dramatic music)

485
00:22:36,446 --> 00:22:37,945
Any change, mister?

486
00:22:37,947 --> 00:22:39,513
I wish.

487
00:22:39,515 --> 00:22:42,282
(dramatic music)

488
00:22:42,284 --> 00:22:43,484
That was the first time

489
00:22:43,486 --> 00:22:46,153
I knew you were
really onto me, Lew.

490
00:22:46,155 --> 00:22:47,687
So I figured the Orlov diamond

491
00:22:47,689 --> 00:22:50,190
was my best chance
at finding Katherine.

492
00:22:50,192 --> 00:22:52,725
Knowing her missing uncle
was a jeweler of course,

493
00:22:52,727 --> 00:22:54,230
you did the usual.

494
00:22:56,466 --> 00:22:58,264
(dramatic music)

495
00:22:58,266 --> 00:23:00,568
I checked every
jewelry dealer in town

496
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,570
even the ones that
didn't have a store,

497
00:23:02,572 --> 00:23:04,338
nothing, not even
a missing jeweler.

498
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,606
(glass shattering)

499
00:23:05,608 --> 00:23:07,107
That bothered me,
and I bothered them.

500
00:23:07,109 --> 00:23:09,342
And, they made not
secret about it.

501
00:23:09,344 --> 00:23:12,245
And, you right at my
heels, well you always knew

502
00:23:12,247 --> 00:23:14,016
how I felt about that.

503
00:23:15,217 --> 00:23:17,484
My life might have
been a slow drip,

504
00:23:17,486 --> 00:23:19,686
but I was definitely bleeding.

505
00:23:19,688 --> 00:23:23,023
And, two Montemars
walk into my office.

506
00:23:23,025 --> 00:23:25,559
Katherine made me
feel alive again,

507
00:23:25,561 --> 00:23:28,795
but Jennifer made me
want to stay that way.

508
00:23:28,797 --> 00:23:32,265
(dramatic music)

509
00:23:32,267 --> 00:23:34,134
I arrived for dinner
at the Montemar house

510
00:23:34,136 --> 00:23:35,869
thinking maybe I could find out

511
00:23:35,871 --> 00:23:38,772
what a respectable,
normal family looked like.

512
00:23:38,774 --> 00:23:42,510
'Cause in my line,
I'd never met one.

513
00:23:42,512 --> 00:23:45,415
(doorbell ringing)

514
00:23:48,918 --> 00:23:50,149
I'm...

515
00:23:50,151 --> 00:23:51,551
Roland Drake, a
private investigator

516
00:23:51,553 --> 00:23:54,088
of Miss Jennifer's acquaintance
who is indeed expected.

517
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,622
Anything else?

518
00:23:55,624 --> 00:23:57,858
Yes, I can't say I care
very much for your shoes.

519
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,094
Please come in.

520
00:24:06,235 --> 00:24:09,738
(clock striking the time)

521
00:24:16,545 --> 00:24:19,746
[Woman] Rivers,
there's no longer steam

522
00:24:19,748 --> 00:24:22,249
coming off of my tea!

523
00:24:22,251 --> 00:24:24,988
(dramatic music)

524
00:24:35,063 --> 00:24:38,098
Mr. Drake, thank you
so much for coming.

525
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,436
Miss Montemar.

526
00:24:42,537 --> 00:24:44,807
Hey baby, who's the rube?

527
00:24:46,842 --> 00:24:49,342
Mr. Roland Drake,
please meet John Shannon.

528
00:24:49,344 --> 00:24:52,713
Mr. Drake has agreed to help me.

529
00:24:52,715 --> 00:24:55,215
Roland, I want to
thank you so much

530
00:24:55,217 --> 00:24:56,716
for helping my girl out.

531
00:24:56,718 --> 00:24:59,186
You know I just gotta
say thanks for just going

532
00:24:59,188 --> 00:25:00,721
out of your way for her.

533
00:25:00,723 --> 00:25:02,055
Yeah well not that
helping her doesn't have

534
00:25:02,057 --> 00:25:05,091
its own benefits,
but it is my job.

535
00:25:05,093 --> 00:25:06,526
What's your job?

536
00:25:06,528 --> 00:25:08,130
Oh I'm her fella.

537
00:25:10,632 --> 00:25:12,401
You're a working guy.

538
00:25:13,902 --> 00:25:16,235
I like helping out.

539
00:25:16,237 --> 00:25:19,406
I help her in, I help her
out of things for free.

540
00:25:19,408 --> 00:25:20,907
But, I got other hobbies.

541
00:25:20,909 --> 00:25:22,443
(laughing)

542
00:25:22,445 --> 00:25:23,711
You want a bell pally?

543
00:25:23,713 --> 00:25:27,313
You mean a drink
or an opportunity?

544
00:25:27,315 --> 00:25:29,716
Both are my bag, right baby?

545
00:25:29,718 --> 00:25:31,351
Dinner's being served.

546
00:25:31,353 --> 00:25:34,754
Johnny, please do try not
to upset mother tonight.

547
00:25:34,756 --> 00:25:36,590
I'm pretty sure the
tin start might upset her

548
00:25:36,592 --> 00:25:38,391
just a little more, huh.

549
00:25:38,393 --> 00:25:41,462
And, I'm sorry if Johnny
appears rude, Mr. Drake.

550
00:25:41,464 --> 00:25:43,129
He really can be very sweet.

551
00:25:43,131 --> 00:25:44,231
Can't you, lover?

552
00:25:44,233 --> 00:25:45,068
For you.

553
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:50,870
Yeah, all right, see youse.

554
00:25:50,872 --> 00:25:52,705
I had an ex secretary
who was real sweet.

555
00:25:52,707 --> 00:25:53,940
Was she?

556
00:25:53,942 --> 00:25:55,341
Yeah, she made
me feel real good,

557
00:25:55,343 --> 00:25:56,510
and when I gave her
dictation, she made me feel

558
00:25:56,512 --> 00:25:57,744
real smart.

559
00:25:57,746 --> 00:25:59,446
Oh you can be a
heel, huh Mr. Drake?

560
00:25:59,448 --> 00:26:00,350
I can be.

561
00:26:01,984 --> 00:26:03,684
Well you don't have
to make a pose of it.

562
00:26:03,686 --> 00:26:05,218
It's the only
pose I have left.

563
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,487
I am gonna have to ask
your fella some questions.

564
00:26:07,489 --> 00:26:09,089
Of course, Johnny would
be more than happy to help

565
00:26:09,091 --> 00:26:10,057
any way he can.

566
00:26:10,059 --> 00:26:11,992
Oh I got that the first time.

567
00:26:11,994 --> 00:26:15,329
And, I will have to ask
your mother some questions.

568
00:26:15,331 --> 00:26:18,032
Well maybe not
too many questions.

569
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,166
Really why?

570
00:26:19,168 --> 00:26:20,634
(giggling)

571
00:26:20,636 --> 00:26:22,305
You'll understand.

572
00:26:23,973 --> 00:26:26,439
Miss Evelyn Montemar, I
present a Mr. Roland Drake,

573
00:26:26,441 --> 00:26:29,076
a private investigator of
Miss Jennifer's acquaintance.

574
00:26:29,078 --> 00:26:30,310
Please don't stand.

575
00:26:30,312 --> 00:26:31,246
I never do.

576
00:26:32,614 --> 00:26:34,848
Where's my first born
isn't Katherine joining us?

577
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:37,350
There hasn't been word, madam.

578
00:26:37,352 --> 00:26:39,288
Well just us tonight.

579
00:26:40,555 --> 00:26:42,689
Katherine was quite
a dish, Mr. Drake.

580
00:26:42,691 --> 00:26:44,858
You know you might even
have a shot with her.

581
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,092
Did you?

582
00:26:46,094 --> 00:26:47,794
No, but I got a
thing for brunettes.

583
00:26:47,796 --> 00:26:48,829
(laughing)

584
00:26:48,831 --> 00:26:50,263
Charming.

585
00:26:50,265 --> 00:26:52,765
Evelyn quite the
spread tonight I must say

586
00:26:52,767 --> 00:26:53,801
like mother like daughter.

587
00:26:53,803 --> 00:26:54,901
You're not funny.

588
00:26:54,903 --> 00:26:57,236
No one thinks you're funny.

589
00:26:57,238 --> 00:26:59,939
(dramatic music)

590
00:26:59,941 --> 00:27:01,574
Is there anything
else I can do?

591
00:27:01,576 --> 00:27:02,911
You do enough.

592
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,879
He's been my strength since
your father disappeared

593
00:27:06,881 --> 00:27:07,717
last week.

594
00:27:09,118 --> 00:27:09,953
Sweet man.

595
00:27:12,254 --> 00:27:14,357
Private investigator, hey?

596
00:27:15,757 --> 00:27:17,858
Aren't you good enough
to be a police detective?

597
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,692
(Johnny laughing)

598
00:27:18,694 --> 00:27:19,926
Mother.

599
00:27:19,928 --> 00:27:22,529
No, my shoes squeak
too much ask Rivers.

600
00:27:22,531 --> 00:27:24,430
I don't like a man
with a sense of humor.

601
00:27:24,432 --> 00:27:25,866
I find it almost as unattractive

602
00:27:25,868 --> 00:27:28,301
as a woman with one.

603
00:27:28,303 --> 00:27:30,137
Depends on what
she's laughing at.

604
00:27:30,139 --> 00:27:34,273
I rarely laughed before my
accident, and less so now.

605
00:27:34,275 --> 00:27:36,176
Although I do find it
amusing that Jennifer

606
00:27:36,178 --> 00:27:40,015
has brought you into our
family business, why?

607
00:27:41,583 --> 00:27:43,015
I would like to
help your daughter.

608
00:27:43,017 --> 00:27:44,350
For a fee, I'm sure.

609
00:27:44,352 --> 00:27:46,820
Well even a shamus gotta eat.

610
00:27:46,822 --> 00:27:47,657
Thank you.

611
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:52,426
Jennifer doesn't have
her own money, Mr. Drake.

612
00:27:52,428 --> 00:27:54,727
So you must be working for me.

613
00:27:54,729 --> 00:27:58,131
Yeah we like hard workers
around here, Mr. Drake.

614
00:27:58,133 --> 00:28:00,701
Yet, you're here
too Johnathan.

615
00:28:00,703 --> 00:28:01,935
Touche.

616
00:28:01,937 --> 00:28:03,236
I told Jennifer about
the newspaper stories

617
00:28:03,238 --> 00:28:06,005
of your disgraceful
behavior, Mr. Drake.

618
00:28:06,007 --> 00:28:07,241
[Roland] Wait till
you see how I eat.

619
00:28:07,243 --> 00:28:09,009
Mother, please
you're being rude.

620
00:28:09,011 --> 00:28:12,111
I have a certain morbid
fascination with failing.

621
00:28:12,113 --> 00:28:14,782
So it was difficult to mask
my delight at meeting you.

622
00:28:14,784 --> 00:28:16,215
You probably noticed.

623
00:28:16,217 --> 00:28:18,151
No, as you and your
daughter keep pointing out,

624
00:28:18,153 --> 00:28:19,887
I'm not that good a detective.

625
00:28:19,889 --> 00:28:22,622
I'm not surprised that Jennifer
sought you out, Mr. Drake.

626
00:28:22,624 --> 00:28:24,824
I'm sure you're the only
detective she could recollect

627
00:28:24,826 --> 00:28:26,760
from my opinions of
your failings regarding

628
00:28:26,762 --> 00:28:28,227
that poor girl.

629
00:28:28,229 --> 00:28:31,430
Katherine is the
reader in this family.

630
00:28:31,432 --> 00:28:33,766
Just because you read
accusations in the newspaper,

631
00:28:33,768 --> 00:28:35,502
doesn't make 'em true.

632
00:28:35,504 --> 00:28:39,705
Yeah, didn't they say that
you were the best, Mr. Drake?

633
00:28:39,707 --> 00:28:43,676
My partner Lew would
agree with you, Johnny.

634
00:28:43,678 --> 00:28:45,178
Smart man.

635
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:48,282
Lew MacDonald's integrity
seems quite unassailable.

636
00:28:48,284 --> 00:28:51,118
Frankly I'm not surprised
he left your partnership.

637
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,288
He cuts quite a fine
figure of a man in print.

638
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:57,190
Lew's always been
uncompromising when it comes

639
00:28:57,192 --> 00:28:58,625
to appearances.

640
00:28:58,627 --> 00:28:59,827
(giggling)

641
00:28:59,829 --> 00:29:02,262
Well you seem a
little more flexible.

642
00:29:02,264 --> 00:29:04,731
I was down on my luck, Johnny.

643
00:29:04,733 --> 00:29:07,900
Why don't you take up reading,
find out what's going on?

644
00:29:07,902 --> 00:29:10,204
Sadly, the only thing
these two ever seem to read

645
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:13,639
are the funny papers
and the obituaries.

646
00:29:13,641 --> 00:29:15,708
Mother, I invited
Mr. Drake here tonight

647
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,677
because I believe that
he can do more for us

648
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,079
than the police are doing.

649
00:29:19,081 --> 00:29:21,180
Wouldn't it make more
sense for you to take

650
00:29:21,182 --> 00:29:24,818
whatever you find to the
police instead of here to us?

651
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,887
No more sense than
slitting my own throat

652
00:29:26,889 --> 00:29:28,254
to get some fresh air.

653
00:29:28,256 --> 00:29:30,290
I do wish Katherine were here.

654
00:29:30,292 --> 00:29:32,492
She would know what to do.

655
00:29:32,494 --> 00:29:34,328
I've often thought
that Katherine took

656
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:37,397
all the refinement
from my womb and left

657
00:29:37,399 --> 00:29:41,467
precious little for out
fascinating Jennifer.

658
00:29:41,469 --> 00:29:43,035
Evelyn, Jennifer
brought me here,

659
00:29:43,037 --> 00:29:45,671
and I'm willing to do
what's necessary to help.

660
00:29:45,673 --> 00:29:47,107
Seems you've done
more than necessary

661
00:29:47,109 --> 00:29:48,841
as far as the police
were concerned.

662
00:29:48,843 --> 00:29:50,444
Perhaps, without
you that poor girl

663
00:29:50,446 --> 00:29:51,978
would still be alive.

664
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,447
The girl's family
contacted me when the police

665
00:29:54,449 --> 00:29:56,416
appeared to be doing nothing.

666
00:29:56,418 --> 00:29:58,452
I found the girl, and I said so.

667
00:29:58,454 --> 00:29:59,686
She died.

668
00:29:59,688 --> 00:30:02,054
The DA and the police
made it easy to hate me

669
00:30:02,056 --> 00:30:04,224
and hard for me to stay
out of a permanent address

670
00:30:04,226 --> 00:30:05,993
with three squares and a cot.

671
00:30:05,995 --> 00:30:08,528
The police are doing
everything they can for us.

672
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:10,863
(crying)

673
00:30:10,865 --> 00:30:13,602
(dramatic music)

674
00:30:17,473 --> 00:30:20,577
I am beside myself
without my Wilson.

675
00:30:24,246 --> 00:30:28,447
All right, I have a
certain morbid curiosity.

676
00:30:28,449 --> 00:30:32,051
When is the last time
you saw your husband?

677
00:30:32,053 --> 00:30:35,187
The last time I saw Wilson
was here at home last week.

678
00:30:35,189 --> 00:30:36,622
When was that exactly?

679
00:30:36,624 --> 00:30:39,592
Tuesday 2:15, he received
a guest in his study.

680
00:30:39,594 --> 00:30:41,093
What was the guest's name?

681
00:30:41,095 --> 00:30:42,696
When Mr. Montemar
has company come

682
00:30:42,698 --> 00:30:44,630
to the backdoor, I've been
given specific instructions

683
00:30:44,632 --> 00:30:46,032
not to notice.

684
00:30:46,034 --> 00:30:47,704
And, his name was?

685
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:53,106
The monogram on his
briefcase bore the letters GG.

686
00:30:53,108 --> 00:30:54,140
You did notice.

687
00:30:54,142 --> 00:30:55,542
Only the third visit.

688
00:30:55,544 --> 00:30:57,577
What happened?

689
00:30:57,579 --> 00:30:58,911
[Rivers] He visited
for 31 minutes

690
00:30:58,913 --> 00:31:01,682
and as per my instructions,
I have no idea

691
00:31:01,684 --> 00:31:04,083
about the nature
of his business.

692
00:31:04,085 --> 00:31:06,552
[GG] As long as
Nadia's book is missing,

693
00:31:06,554 --> 00:31:09,055
the operation is not safe.

694
00:31:09,057 --> 00:31:13,592
The diamond will never be
safer than it is with me.

695
00:31:13,594 --> 00:31:17,097
Well afraid we must
disagree, my friend.

696
00:31:17,099 --> 00:31:19,465
Nadia's death could...

697
00:31:19,467 --> 00:31:21,334
[Rivers] I'm sorry to
say I didn't see or hear

698
00:31:21,336 --> 00:31:23,704
any of their conversation
unfortunately.

699
00:31:23,706 --> 00:31:25,405
You're being coy with
me, aren't you Rivers?

700
00:31:25,407 --> 00:31:27,240
It hadn't occurred to me, no.

701
00:31:27,242 --> 00:31:30,609
The house isn't that big,
someone had to see him leave.

702
00:31:30,611 --> 00:31:31,447
No.

703
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:33,446
[Roland] Rivers?

704
00:31:33,448 --> 00:31:35,581
No, honestly no.

705
00:31:35,583 --> 00:31:39,755
All right so nobody say Wilson
or this GG leave the house?

706
00:31:40,922 --> 00:31:42,488
I assumed he was
delayed with business,

707
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:44,724
so we ate dinner without
him which is normally beyond

708
00:31:44,726 --> 00:31:46,259
contemplation.

709
00:31:46,261 --> 00:31:49,128
I waited some time for
him, and then I had

710
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:50,731
Rivers put me to bed.

711
00:31:50,733 --> 00:31:52,331
And, you never followed
up, and you never called

712
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:53,532
the police?

713
00:31:53,534 --> 00:31:55,234
Later I thought I
heard them in the study.

714
00:31:55,236 --> 00:31:57,236
I heard voices.

715
00:31:57,238 --> 00:31:59,473
Wouldn't be the first time.

716
00:31:59,475 --> 00:32:02,975
Jennifer, we agreed how
unattractive that sense

717
00:32:02,977 --> 00:32:05,579
of humor is, didn't we?

718
00:32:05,581 --> 00:32:08,318
(dramatic music)

719
00:32:09,752 --> 00:32:12,886
Jennifer, I never asked you
where you were that night.

720
00:32:12,888 --> 00:32:14,855
(knocking)

721
00:32:14,857 --> 00:32:16,389
Oh you don't have to
wait for the door.

722
00:32:16,391 --> 00:32:19,493
You can just go ahead and
answer the question right now.

723
00:32:19,495 --> 00:32:21,962
I spent the entire
day with John.

724
00:32:21,964 --> 00:32:23,397
Yeah.

725
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,563
Great.

726
00:32:24,565 --> 00:32:25,499
Yeah it was great.

727
00:32:25,501 --> 00:32:26,832
It was a very good day.

728
00:32:26,834 --> 00:32:28,100
Very great.

729
00:32:28,102 --> 00:32:30,003
And, then I came
home late, alone,

730
00:32:30,005 --> 00:32:32,472
and found out that my
father was missing.

731
00:32:32,474 --> 00:32:33,907
Not much of a alibi.

732
00:32:33,909 --> 00:32:36,309
Hey, how 'bout I pop you
right in the kisser, all right!

733
00:32:36,311 --> 00:32:37,476
[Evelyn] Gentlemen!

734
00:32:37,478 --> 00:32:38,445
Hey I'm just trying
to keep it civil

735
00:32:38,447 --> 00:32:39,478
with this flat tire.

736
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,981
What's your alibi?

737
00:32:40,983 --> 00:32:41,814
What?

738
00:32:41,816 --> 00:32:43,082
She just said it.

739
00:32:43,084 --> 00:32:44,583
(doorbell ringing)

740
00:32:44,585 --> 00:32:45,819
What?

741
00:32:45,821 --> 00:32:47,620
You got something
in your ears, pally?

742
00:32:47,622 --> 00:32:49,955
Can't hear anything?

743
00:32:49,957 --> 00:32:51,792
What do you want me to say?

744
00:32:51,794 --> 00:32:53,894
We had a lovely afternoon.

745
00:32:53,896 --> 00:32:55,361
Yeah.

746
00:32:55,363 --> 00:32:57,030
We did things that a
fella does with his dame.

747
00:32:57,032 --> 00:32:58,865
It was a lovely afternoon.

748
00:32:58,867 --> 00:33:00,667
It's not your
business, all right?

749
00:33:00,669 --> 00:33:01,568
What'd you see?

750
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:02,968
What'd you do?

751
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:05,504
I saw a lot of this
lovely young lady,

752
00:33:05,506 --> 00:33:07,374
and you better keep
your eyes off, pal.

753
00:33:07,376 --> 00:33:09,509
I see what you're
doing with those eyes.

754
00:33:09,511 --> 00:33:11,043
This belongs to me.

755
00:33:11,045 --> 00:33:12,646
It's off limits.

756
00:33:12,648 --> 00:33:13,483
Huh?

757
00:33:14,983 --> 00:33:17,986
You want to ask
some more questions?

758
00:33:20,488 --> 00:33:22,789
Detective Barry Tate
of the Los Angeles

759
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:24,357
Police Department.

760
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:27,030
(ominous music)

761
00:33:28,663 --> 00:33:31,564
Please excuse
the interruption.

762
00:33:31,566 --> 00:33:34,667
I'm just here to ask, Drake?

763
00:33:34,669 --> 00:33:37,971
I hope you're here in
a non working capacity.

764
00:33:37,973 --> 00:33:41,241
We're birds of a
feather that way, Barry.

765
00:33:41,243 --> 00:33:44,744
I'm here about
Wilson Montemar.

766
00:33:44,746 --> 00:33:46,946
I'm Jennifer Montemar.

767
00:33:46,948 --> 00:33:48,814
What have you discovered?

768
00:33:48,816 --> 00:33:51,685
Well Miss Montemar, we
found your father's car

769
00:33:51,687 --> 00:33:55,288
abandoned on Hope
Street near Sixth.

770
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:56,990
What about my father?

771
00:33:56,992 --> 00:34:00,292
Well Miss, we haven't found
him or his belongings yet.

772
00:34:00,294 --> 00:34:02,829
But, we did find fresh
blood in the car,

773
00:34:02,831 --> 00:34:06,500
and I figure with that
blood that this is becoming

774
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:10,035
less and less a
missing persons case.

775
00:34:10,037 --> 00:34:11,637
Interesting.

776
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,405
What is interesting?

777
00:34:13,407 --> 00:34:15,575
[Roland] 'Cause you
figured something out, Bar.

778
00:34:15,577 --> 00:34:18,345
I will allow you to
stay in my presence

779
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:22,149
for a moment, but there's
something more important here,

780
00:34:22,151 --> 00:34:24,850
finding Wilson Montemar.

781
00:34:24,852 --> 00:34:27,887
Now there you might
have figured wrong.

782
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:30,058
And, why is that, Drake?

783
00:34:31,459 --> 00:34:34,693
Do you care to tell the
law something for a change?

784
00:34:34,695 --> 00:34:36,428
I don't have my
fingers in all the pies

785
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:37,898
the way you do.

786
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,633
Well I am not
leaving this place

787
00:34:40,635 --> 00:34:44,771
until I have found out
everything that I need to know

788
00:34:44,773 --> 00:34:46,441
to help you, Evelyn.

789
00:34:50,077 --> 00:34:53,979
Now Evelyn, is there
something else we should be

790
00:34:53,981 --> 00:34:55,418
looking for here?

791
00:34:56,751 --> 00:35:00,553
I don't know what
you're asking of me.

792
00:35:00,555 --> 00:35:01,890
I believe you.

793
00:35:03,992 --> 00:35:08,394
Jennifer, I believe that
you are so concerned

794
00:35:08,396 --> 00:35:11,566
with getting back
what is yours, well,

795
00:35:13,068 --> 00:35:16,570
have you any idea what
your father is up to?

796
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:19,939
I only know that he's
missing, and that you found

797
00:35:19,941 --> 00:35:21,474
his car.

798
00:35:21,476 --> 00:35:24,146
Well it's lucky that I'm here.

799
00:35:26,447 --> 00:35:31,117
Give me one reason why I
should leave you in this room,

800
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:31,952
Drake?

801
00:35:31,954 --> 00:35:34,588
I like cooked goose,

802
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,823
and the company's good.

803
00:35:36,825 --> 00:35:38,791
Maybe Katherine knows.

804
00:35:38,793 --> 00:35:42,030
When do I get to talk
to her in person?

805
00:35:43,965 --> 00:35:45,064
Oh.

806
00:35:45,066 --> 00:35:47,335
(laughing)

807
00:35:51,006 --> 00:35:53,342
Katherine's not here is she?

808
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:59,945
You didn't try to help
her like you helped

809
00:35:59,947 --> 00:36:03,983
that missing girl,
Nadia, did you Drake?

810
00:36:03,985 --> 00:36:06,388
You know the one that's dead.

811
00:36:07,555 --> 00:36:09,088
No if anyone's
gonna help a girl,

812
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:12,024
you're the one to
pull the trigger.

813
00:36:12,026 --> 00:36:14,130
Don't mess this one up.

814
00:36:15,497 --> 00:36:17,097
You don't talk
with your hands.

815
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:18,965
Oh I'm going to be
doing more than talking

816
00:36:18,967 --> 00:36:20,432
with my hands.

817
00:36:20,434 --> 00:36:21,635
There's ladies present.

818
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:23,436
Funny last words, Drake.

819
00:36:23,438 --> 00:36:28,408
Detective Tate, I don't
appreciate violence in my house.

820
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:30,343
Yes, thank you very much
for all of the information

821
00:36:30,345 --> 00:36:32,945
and please let us know if
you discover anything else.

822
00:36:32,947 --> 00:36:34,713
Thank you for coming.

823
00:36:34,715 --> 00:36:37,149
I would dissuade your
daughter from having

824
00:36:37,151 --> 00:36:40,755
any further contact
with Roland Drake, mam.

825
00:36:43,325 --> 00:36:44,427
So would I.

826
00:36:45,626 --> 00:36:48,463
I will be talking
to all of you.

827
00:36:51,666 --> 00:36:52,500
Mam.

828
00:36:53,602 --> 00:36:56,339
(dramatic music)

829
00:37:00,474 --> 00:37:02,711
Well, that was delicious.

830
00:37:10,651 --> 00:37:13,421
(dramatic music)

831
00:37:15,823 --> 00:37:17,392
I still need you.

832
00:37:18,226 --> 00:37:20,997
(dramatic music)

833
00:38:10,412 --> 00:38:15,215
Although I've no sensation,
the pain is constant.

834
00:38:15,217 --> 00:38:17,986
(dramatic music)

835
00:38:28,195 --> 00:38:30,430
(rocks clattering)

836
00:38:30,432 --> 00:38:33,202
(dramatic music)

837
00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:43,575
Blame where there
should be love.

838
00:38:43,577 --> 00:38:46,349
(dramatic music)

839
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:52,352
I'm sure you mean guilt
where there should be love.

840
00:38:52,354 --> 00:38:56,455
Why Jennifer, I never
get such a rise out of you.

841
00:38:56,457 --> 00:38:58,727
(laughing)

842
00:39:04,231 --> 00:39:06,832
Mother, I let you
berate me and berate me

843
00:39:06,834 --> 00:39:08,867
day after day and
night after night,

844
00:39:08,869 --> 00:39:10,135
but not tonight.

845
00:39:10,137 --> 00:39:12,604
No, you're gonna shut your trap!

846
00:39:12,606 --> 00:39:14,807
You don't dare
speak to me that...

847
00:39:14,809 --> 00:39:16,508
Yes, I do.

848
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:21,414
I know a mother should never
feel what I feel for you.

849
00:39:21,416 --> 00:39:24,751
Rivers, I want you to
call Lew MacDonald.

850
00:39:24,753 --> 00:39:26,251
Get him on the telephone.

851
00:39:26,253 --> 00:39:27,887
Tell him I will pay him
whatever he requires of me

852
00:39:27,889 --> 00:39:29,588
to get to the bottom of this.

853
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,789
Tell him!

854
00:39:30,791 --> 00:39:33,225
Mother, I already
have Mr. Drake.

855
00:39:33,227 --> 00:39:36,062
[Evelyn] It should be
you, not me in that chair.

856
00:39:36,064 --> 00:39:38,801
(dramatic music)

857
00:39:42,637 --> 00:39:46,238
So, like your
goose cooked, hey?

858
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,341
It pains me as a
mother that you are

859
00:39:48,343 --> 00:39:50,410
such a disappointment.

860
00:39:50,412 --> 00:39:53,646
Well then allow me
to take away your pain.

861
00:39:53,648 --> 00:39:55,113
No!

862
00:39:55,115 --> 00:39:59,151
Beverly Hills 4044,
the Lew MacDonald Agency.

863
00:39:59,153 --> 00:40:00,285
[Jennifer] What you...

864
00:40:00,287 --> 00:40:02,055
Hello Mr. MacDonald.

865
00:40:02,057 --> 00:40:03,222
[Jennifer] <i>Paid
more attention to me</i>

866
00:40:03,224 --> 00:40:04,724
This is the
Montemar residence.

867
00:40:04,726 --> 00:40:05,959
[Jennifer] <i>instead of
blaming me for everything.</i>

868
00:40:05,961 --> 00:40:07,459
Yes.

869
00:40:07,461 --> 00:40:08,928
We'd like to engage your
services tomorrow morning.

870
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:10,329
[Evelyn] <i>There would
be nothing to blame.</i>

871
00:40:10,331 --> 00:40:10,930
Oh that?

872
00:40:10,932 --> 00:40:12,398
(Jennifer yelling)

873
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,700
That's an unseemly radio play
I have in the background.

874
00:40:14,702 --> 00:40:17,970
I should've turned that
down, I'm terribly sorry.

875
00:40:17,972 --> 00:40:21,075
So tomorrow morning
bright and early?

876
00:40:22,209 --> 00:40:25,780
Yes, it is a delightful
surprise, isn't it?

877
00:40:29,416 --> 00:40:30,249
Stop!

878
00:40:30,251 --> 00:40:31,117
[Evelyn] Rivers!

879
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:31,954
Stop!

880
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:36,758
Here, use the pillow.

881
00:40:37,626 --> 00:40:40,260
It helps with her pain.

882
00:40:40,262 --> 00:40:43,095
(ominous music)

883
00:40:43,097 --> 00:40:43,932
Rivers.

884
00:40:46,334 --> 00:40:48,635
(laughing)

885
00:40:48,637 --> 00:40:51,271
You don't have the guts.

886
00:40:51,273 --> 00:40:52,604
(slapping)

887
00:40:52,606 --> 00:40:54,240
(smacking)

888
00:40:54,242 --> 00:40:56,910
[Barry] You can't leave
well enough alone, can you?

889
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:58,244
(smacking)

890
00:40:58,246 --> 00:41:00,079
(coughing)

891
00:41:00,081 --> 00:41:02,448
You won't make
it stop doing this.

892
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:05,751
I had it all wrapped
up in a neat little box.

893
00:41:05,753 --> 00:41:07,720
(smacking)

894
00:41:07,722 --> 00:41:09,521
She doesn't have to be found.

895
00:41:09,523 --> 00:41:11,793
(smacking)

896
00:41:13,294 --> 00:41:16,396
Yeah so, that little black
book was worth killing her,

897
00:41:16,398 --> 00:41:17,664
huh?

898
00:41:17,666 --> 00:41:19,999
No, you killing
her was worth it.

899
00:41:20,001 --> 00:41:21,200
(smacking)

900
00:41:21,202 --> 00:41:22,869
(coughing)

901
00:41:22,871 --> 00:41:27,807
I protect and serve my
city, and the profitability

902
00:41:27,809 --> 00:41:29,374
of our ventures.

903
00:41:29,376 --> 00:41:32,044
(smacking)

904
00:41:32,046 --> 00:41:35,814
I was mad that you
didn't get the chair

905
00:41:35,816 --> 00:41:38,450
for murdering that
backstabbing little...

906
00:41:38,452 --> 00:41:39,785
(smacking)

907
00:41:39,787 --> 00:41:41,254
whore.

908
00:41:41,256 --> 00:41:44,090
Well I guess you don't
control everything, do you?

909
00:41:44,092 --> 00:41:46,262
(choking)

910
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:52,133
Oh yes, but there is one
thing I control tonight.

911
00:41:53,001 --> 00:41:54,503
You may disappear.

912
00:41:56,236 --> 00:41:58,838
That's a shame 'cause
I have the black book.

913
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,010
(choking)

914
00:42:02,177 --> 00:42:03,709
[Barry] Liar.

915
00:42:03,711 --> 00:42:05,477
You wouldn't risk it.

916
00:42:05,479 --> 00:42:07,983
The only one at risk is you.

917
00:42:09,249 --> 00:42:12,184
No one knows you're
up here with me.

918
00:42:12,186 --> 00:42:14,653
Now we've spent
enough time together

919
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:17,992
for you to tell me
where the book is now.

920
00:42:19,293 --> 00:42:21,494
(smacking)

921
00:42:21,496 --> 00:42:24,332
If not, you
eventually will beg me

922
00:42:26,568 --> 00:42:28,568
(smacking)

923
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:30,838
to throw you off this roof.

924
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:33,305
You're a missing person.

925
00:42:33,307 --> 00:42:35,408
You always were.

926
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:37,477
Nobody's gonna come and find you

927
00:42:37,479 --> 00:42:39,512
because nobody cares.

928
00:42:39,514 --> 00:42:42,351
(fleshy thudding)

929
00:42:44,184 --> 00:42:46,318
Why don't you pull up a chair?

930
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,053
I got a nice view.

931
00:42:48,055 --> 00:42:49,324
We got options.

932
00:42:51,892 --> 00:42:54,295
You don't have any options.

933
00:42:55,296 --> 00:42:57,696
You are going to disappear.

934
00:42:57,698 --> 00:42:59,564
Just like you did
to Katherine Montemar?

935
00:42:59,566 --> 00:43:01,836
(grunting)

936
00:43:04,706 --> 00:43:06,207
I heard tonight.

937
00:43:07,675 --> 00:43:09,809
Let me clue you in.

938
00:43:09,811 --> 00:43:11,343
She's dead.

939
00:43:11,345 --> 00:43:12,180
Dead?

940
00:43:13,847 --> 00:43:15,481
You're lying.

941
00:43:15,483 --> 00:43:16,318
How?

942
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:20,923
I ask the questions,
you give the answers.

943
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:24,157
If you don't, you are going...

944
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:24,994
Sir.

945
00:43:27,028 --> 00:43:28,928
Turn around, officer.

946
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:31,164
Get back to what you were doing.

947
00:43:31,166 --> 00:43:32,832
It's not that, sir.

948
00:43:32,834 --> 00:43:34,200
You said that you didn't
want to be interrupted

949
00:43:34,202 --> 00:43:36,436
unless he showed up.

950
00:43:36,438 --> 00:43:37,271
He's here.

951
00:43:41,108 --> 00:43:42,110
All right.

952
00:43:45,814 --> 00:43:49,251
Such a nice evening,
really nice evening.

953
00:43:50,351 --> 00:43:52,350
You know I think
I'll give you a break

954
00:43:52,352 --> 00:43:54,220
until I get back.

955
00:43:54,222 --> 00:43:55,387
How 'bout a jaw?

956
00:43:55,389 --> 00:43:57,055
(fleshy crunching)

957
00:43:57,057 --> 00:43:59,561
(tense music)

958
00:44:03,731 --> 00:44:04,564
(muttering)

959
00:44:04,566 --> 00:44:05,597
Stay safe.

960
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,102
(tense music)

961
00:44:17,077 --> 00:44:19,747
(phone ringing)

962
00:44:21,349 --> 00:44:23,082
I found her.

963
00:44:23,084 --> 00:44:24,450
What?

964
00:44:24,452 --> 00:44:25,785
I found Nadia.

965
00:44:25,787 --> 00:44:28,086
(dramatic music)

966
00:44:28,088 --> 00:44:29,722
Get out of there.

967
00:44:29,724 --> 00:44:31,323
What are you talking about?

968
00:44:31,325 --> 00:44:32,390
I found the girl.

969
00:44:32,392 --> 00:44:33,728
Call the police.

970
00:44:36,664 --> 00:44:39,999
(fleshy sucking)

971
00:44:40,001 --> 00:44:42,771
(dramatic music)

972
00:44:54,548 --> 00:44:57,052
(guns firing)

973
00:45:01,856 --> 00:45:04,189
(yelling)

974
00:45:04,191 --> 00:45:06,695
(guns firing)

975
00:45:10,731 --> 00:45:12,900
(yelling)

976
00:45:16,905 --> 00:45:20,106
(dramatic music)

977
00:45:20,108 --> 00:45:22,408
(yelling)

978
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:25,443
(guns cocking)

979
00:45:25,445 --> 00:45:28,217
(dramatic music)

980
00:45:32,887 --> 00:45:35,157
(grunting)

981
00:45:39,394 --> 00:45:40,827
(gun firing)

982
00:45:40,829 --> 00:45:41,662
No!

983
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:44,062
(dramatic music)

984
00:45:44,064 --> 00:45:47,099
(grunting)

985
00:45:47,101 --> 00:45:49,872
(dramatic music)

986
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:04,919
(thunder crashing)

987
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,930
(dramatic music)

988
00:46:23,637 --> 00:46:26,671
(thunder crashing)

989
00:46:26,673 --> 00:46:29,610
(chair clattering)

990
00:46:31,445 --> 00:46:33,948
(tense music)

991
00:47:06,613 --> 00:47:09,448
[Barry] This is how
we do things in my city.

992
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:12,285
When things move through,
I serve and protect.

993
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:15,720
I always get my cut,
my piece of everything.

994
00:47:15,722 --> 00:47:17,189
You can't change this.

995
00:47:17,191 --> 00:47:19,258
[Man] You changed it
when you killed his niece.

996
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:21,093
[Barry] You don't know
that I killed his niece.

997
00:47:21,095 --> 00:47:22,160
(laughing)

998
00:47:22,162 --> 00:47:23,629
[Man] We know everything.

999
00:47:23,631 --> 00:47:25,564
That's why you work for us.

1000
00:47:25,566 --> 00:47:28,800
[Barry] I may work for
you, but this is my city.

1001
00:47:28,802 --> 00:47:31,504
This isn't some painting
or broken piece of pottery

1002
00:47:31,506 --> 00:47:32,905
this time.

1003
00:47:32,907 --> 00:47:36,341
This rock is the most valuable
item we've ever moved,

1004
00:47:36,343 --> 00:47:37,676
and I get my cut.

1005
00:47:37,678 --> 00:47:41,479
[Man] You are, to
use the term of your

1006
00:47:41,481 --> 00:47:44,052
own organization, on probation.

1007
00:47:45,485 --> 00:47:48,153
They will decide when you
are part of this again.

1008
00:47:48,155 --> 00:47:49,854
[Barry] I won't
standby on this one.

1009
00:47:49,856 --> 00:47:52,557
My forces are powerful,
and you need me.

1010
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:53,725
When I find this...

1011
00:47:53,727 --> 00:47:55,528
[Man] Stay out of it.

1012
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:57,562
It is beyond you now.

1013
00:47:57,564 --> 00:47:59,765
[Barry] Nothing
is beyond my reach.

1014
00:47:59,767 --> 00:48:02,233
[Man] Don't you dare
walk away from me.

1015
00:48:02,235 --> 00:48:04,202
(safe dial clicking)

1016
00:48:04,204 --> 00:48:06,707
(tense music)

1017
00:48:11,579 --> 00:48:14,546
[Man] Find where Montemar
is, bring him to us.

1018
00:48:14,548 --> 00:48:16,048
(safe latch clicking)

1019
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:20,186
Make problems, and it is
you who will be exported.

1020
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:23,823
[Barry] You think you
can come into my precinct,

1021
00:48:23,825 --> 00:48:26,662
my office, and
tell me what to do?

1022
00:48:27,996 --> 00:48:29,327
I am this city.

1023
00:48:29,329 --> 00:48:31,497
This is my rule of law.

1024
00:48:31,499 --> 00:48:34,300
If you want to live,
don't ever tell me

1025
00:48:34,302 --> 00:48:35,667
what to do again.

1026
00:48:35,669 --> 00:48:36,901
(speaking in a foreign language)

1027
00:48:36,903 --> 00:48:37,736
[Man] You...

1028
00:48:37,738 --> 00:48:40,071
(gun firing)

1029
00:48:40,073 --> 00:48:42,977
(thunder crashing)

1030
00:48:44,878 --> 00:48:47,648
(dramatic music)

1031
00:48:51,753 --> 00:48:54,423
(phone ringing)

1032
00:49:00,394 --> 00:49:02,898
(tense music)

1033
00:49:05,365 --> 00:49:08,035
(safe clicking)

1034
00:49:10,637 --> 00:49:13,140
(tense music)

1035
00:49:37,564 --> 00:49:41,168
Mathews, another
suspect tried to escape.

1036
00:49:42,003 --> 00:49:43,604
Clean this mess up.

1037
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:51,013
(dramatic music)

1038
00:49:54,048 --> 00:49:56,481
I want everyone of our
men looking for Drake.

1039
00:49:56,483 --> 00:49:58,586
He's still got that book.

1040
00:50:00,421 --> 00:50:03,325
(thunder crashing)

1041
00:50:07,628 --> 00:50:09,095
Nadia had a book.

1042
00:50:09,097 --> 00:50:11,363
Black with the dark
afterglow confessions

1043
00:50:11,365 --> 00:50:13,532
written in her own code.

1044
00:50:13,534 --> 00:50:16,001
Her words up till then
were the only safe

1045
00:50:16,003 --> 00:50:18,204
I could never crack.

1046
00:50:18,206 --> 00:50:20,673
Police corruption,
Wilson's own name,

1047
00:50:20,675 --> 00:50:22,441
and the priceless
things moving through

1048
00:50:22,443 --> 00:50:24,910
the deepest arteries
of the city unseen

1049
00:50:24,912 --> 00:50:27,245
all found new meaning
in the diamond

1050
00:50:27,247 --> 00:50:31,186
as it flawlessly destroyed
the Montemar family.

1051
00:50:32,686 --> 00:50:35,053
The black book wasn't
just an insurance policy

1052
00:50:35,055 --> 00:50:38,557
anymore, it was a chance
to set it all right.

1053
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:39,925
You had it?

1054
00:50:39,927 --> 00:50:41,861
Of course, well played.

1055
00:50:41,863 --> 00:50:42,964
Where was it?

1056
00:50:44,231 --> 00:50:45,300
Just curious.

1057
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:50,572
Fine, so that's why no one would
really testify against you.

1058
00:50:52,305 --> 00:50:54,205
(laughing)

1059
00:50:54,207 --> 00:50:56,008
Very well played.

1060
00:50:56,010 --> 00:50:57,575
A lot of names in that book.

1061
00:50:57,577 --> 00:51:01,379
If anything happened to
me, I made provisions.

1062
00:51:01,381 --> 00:51:04,119
(dramatic music)

1063
00:51:18,331 --> 00:51:19,965
[Officer] Geez
Drake, this place

1064
00:51:19,967 --> 00:51:22,137
is a Petrie dish of germs.

1065
00:51:23,604 --> 00:51:26,374
(dramatic music)

1066
00:51:30,244 --> 00:51:31,876
(phone clicking)

1067
00:51:31,878 --> 00:51:33,111
[Dispatcher] Dispatch.

1068
00:51:33,113 --> 00:51:36,048
Tate, I want an all
points bulletin put out

1069
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:37,383
on Roland Drake.

1070
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:38,517
[Dispatcher] What's
the charge, sir?

1071
00:51:38,519 --> 00:51:39,621
The charge?

1072
00:51:41,189 --> 00:51:42,357
I found blood.

1073
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:46,258
I'll come up with something.

1074
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:47,459
[Dispatcher] Yes sir.

1075
00:51:47,461 --> 00:51:50,232
(dramatic music)

1076
00:52:35,075 --> 00:52:37,575
Move over
Jennifer, I'll drive.

1077
00:52:37,577 --> 00:52:40,314
(dramatic music)

1078
00:52:48,622 --> 00:52:51,126
So Wilson seems to be missing.

1079
00:52:54,729 --> 00:52:59,430
I know, and I'm really
worried about my father.

1080
00:52:59,432 --> 00:53:03,103
Montemars always know
more than they tell.

1081
00:53:05,305 --> 00:53:07,708
He and I were working a deal.

1082
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:14,582
I know you have a precious
little (knife clicking) item.

1083
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:22,724
Are we driving someplace?

1084
00:53:24,224 --> 00:53:26,758
Even with him gone, it
doesn't mean you and I

1085
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,459
can't be in bed together.

1086
00:53:28,461 --> 00:53:31,298
We've always been
close, Jennifer.

1087
00:53:33,968 --> 00:53:36,635
Never with my consent.

1088
00:53:36,637 --> 00:53:38,537
Now let's do
this deal together,

1089
00:53:38,539 --> 00:53:41,205
and then you and I
can go somewhere new,

1090
00:53:41,207 --> 00:53:44,410
a cottage in the woods,
neighbors miles away

1091
00:53:44,412 --> 00:53:46,512
visit only occasionally.

1092
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:50,684
They smile at us and pat
our children on the head,

1093
00:53:52,153 --> 00:53:53,321
never knowing.

1094
00:53:55,622 --> 00:53:57,791
You have to give it to me.

1095
00:53:58,726 --> 00:54:00,227
Give it to me now!

1096
00:54:03,731 --> 00:54:04,896
(fleshy sucking)

1097
00:54:04,898 --> 00:54:07,067
(choking)

1098
00:54:08,168 --> 00:54:10,904
(dramatic music)

1099
00:54:19,146 --> 00:54:20,745
What happened to you?

1100
00:54:20,747 --> 00:54:24,615
So after dinner, I was
peeking in your mom's bedroom.

1101
00:54:24,617 --> 00:54:26,151
And?

1102
00:54:26,153 --> 00:54:27,419
I fell.

1103
00:54:27,421 --> 00:54:29,354
Tate caught me.

1104
00:54:29,356 --> 00:54:31,155
I wish I hit the ground.

1105
00:54:31,157 --> 00:54:33,894
(dramatic music)

1106
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:02,222
So what are we
gonna do about John?

1107
00:55:06,494 --> 00:55:09,695
(glass shattering)

1108
00:55:09,697 --> 00:55:12,467
(dramatic music)

1109
00:55:21,541 --> 00:55:22,376
Mother?

1110
00:55:24,244 --> 00:55:27,178
Rivers you've been my
strength since my Wilson

1111
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:28,646
disappeared?

1112
00:55:28,648 --> 00:55:30,417
You're so good to me.

1113
00:55:31,251 --> 00:55:32,353
I don't tell.

1114
00:55:35,389 --> 00:55:36,854
This is getting weird.

1115
00:55:36,856 --> 00:55:39,658
Things are making so
much sense right now.

1116
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:42,361
I'm glad they are for you.

1117
00:55:42,363 --> 00:55:45,497
Oh my God, why
are you doing this?

1118
00:55:45,499 --> 00:55:46,365
Why?

1119
00:55:46,367 --> 00:55:48,635
(laughing)

1120
00:55:50,037 --> 00:55:53,539
Rivers, you
handsome, handsome man.

1121
00:55:53,541 --> 00:55:56,311
Wait till they
find out I'm dead.

1122
00:55:57,644 --> 00:56:00,611
(laughing)

1123
00:56:00,613 --> 00:56:01,448
Mom.

1124
00:56:03,717 --> 00:56:06,053
(screaming)

1125
00:56:07,121 --> 00:56:08,722
Is she really dead?

1126
00:56:12,126 --> 00:56:14,863
(dramatic music)

1127
00:56:25,305 --> 00:56:29,374
Please comb my hair
before the police arrive.

1128
00:56:29,376 --> 00:56:31,379
The police can't come.

1129
00:56:32,479 --> 00:56:35,215
(dramatic music)

1130
00:56:36,916 --> 00:56:39,117
That would be a
Mr. John Shannon

1131
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:42,122
arriving
uncharacteristically early.

1132
00:56:45,124 --> 00:56:48,195
Johnny hi, I'm so
glad you're here.

1133
00:56:51,698 --> 00:56:53,164
Drake, what are
you doing here?

1134
00:56:53,166 --> 00:56:55,901
I'm just here to check
out her father's study.

1135
00:56:55,903 --> 00:56:58,870
Oh no, that room's been
gone over many times.

1136
00:56:58,872 --> 00:57:00,104
Don't bother.

1137
00:57:00,106 --> 00:57:02,106
Well do you mind if
I earn my 45 a day?

1138
00:57:02,108 --> 00:57:03,709
35 a day.

1139
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:05,443
You look like you
could use a beer.

1140
00:57:05,445 --> 00:57:06,644
You know I could use one.

1141
00:57:06,646 --> 00:57:07,579
A little early.

1142
00:57:07,581 --> 00:57:09,150
It's late for me.

1143
00:57:10,584 --> 00:57:12,917
[Roland] You got all the
sides covered don't you?

1144
00:57:12,919 --> 00:57:14,051
Excuse me?

1145
00:57:14,053 --> 00:57:16,254
You and me in the bedroom.

1146
00:57:16,256 --> 00:57:18,289
That was real.

1147
00:57:18,291 --> 00:57:19,658
And, what's this?

1148
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:21,827
This was covering our bases.

1149
00:57:21,829 --> 00:57:23,662
Don't do me any favors.

1150
00:57:23,664 --> 00:57:25,329
Are you crazy?

1151
00:57:25,331 --> 00:57:27,666
All of that had to
happen in front of you.

1152
00:57:27,668 --> 00:57:29,401
Don't question my feelings.

1153
00:57:29,403 --> 00:57:30,869
It's a simple mistake.

1154
00:57:30,871 --> 00:57:34,106
You show me some affection,
and I go and believe it.

1155
00:57:34,108 --> 00:57:38,278
You know you might actually
like how this turns out.

1156
00:57:41,314 --> 00:57:43,414
My father's study's
down the hallway.

1157
00:57:43,416 --> 00:57:45,085
I'll meet you there.

1158
00:57:46,019 --> 00:57:47,354
Do you trust me?

1159
00:57:49,456 --> 00:57:50,791
Do you trust me?

1160
00:57:52,825 --> 00:57:55,063
(laughing)

1161
00:58:03,637 --> 00:58:04,570
John.

1162
00:58:04,572 --> 00:58:05,937
What is he doing here?

1163
00:58:05,939 --> 00:58:07,606
Was he here all night?

1164
00:58:07,608 --> 00:58:09,173
Why are you in your nightgown?

1165
00:58:09,175 --> 00:58:10,207
Was he in your bedroom?

1166
00:58:10,209 --> 00:58:11,577
What does he know?

1167
00:58:11,579 --> 00:58:13,378
Calm down.

1168
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:14,782
We will find out.

1169
00:58:16,015 --> 00:58:17,950
Now about Drake.

1170
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:20,084
Oh yeah, shush.

1171
00:58:20,086 --> 00:58:22,019
We'll find out what
he knows together.

1172
00:58:22,021 --> 00:58:23,220
Yes.

1173
00:58:23,222 --> 00:58:24,722
Do you honestly think
he knows something

1174
00:58:24,724 --> 00:58:26,393
he's not telling us?

1175
00:58:28,329 --> 00:58:29,695
I got an idea.

1176
00:58:29,697 --> 00:58:32,467
(dramatic music)

1177
00:58:37,671 --> 00:58:39,805
Johnny, you're
kidding right tough guy?

1178
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:41,205
I don't like Johnny.

1179
00:58:41,207 --> 00:58:42,673
Neither do I.

1180
00:58:42,675 --> 00:58:44,142
Much as I don't want
to, I'll have to hurt her

1181
00:58:44,144 --> 00:58:45,276
if you don't talk.

1182
00:58:45,278 --> 00:58:46,445
You're all heart.

1183
00:58:46,447 --> 00:58:47,678
We're gonna talk about you,

1184
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,080
we're gonna talk about
that Orlov diamond.

1185
00:58:49,082 --> 00:58:51,182
I think you know more
than you're letting on.

1186
00:58:51,184 --> 00:58:52,651
You need to stop that.

1187
00:58:52,653 --> 00:58:53,484
What?

1188
00:58:53,486 --> 00:58:54,986
Thinking.

1189
00:58:54,988 --> 00:58:57,856
I love Jennifer, and
I won't let you ruin it!

1190
00:58:57,858 --> 00:59:00,725
You're good for her,
oh I can see that.

1191
00:59:00,727 --> 00:59:02,928
If you care anything
about her whatsoever,

1192
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:05,097
you're gonna tell me what
you know about that diamond.

1193
00:59:05,099 --> 00:59:08,600
I can't tell you
where the diamond is.

1194
00:59:08,602 --> 00:59:09,434
Wrong.

1195
00:59:09,436 --> 00:59:12,173
(dramatic music)

1196
00:59:14,307 --> 00:59:16,707
Look you're jealous,
I get it Drake,

1197
00:59:16,709 --> 00:59:19,611
but let's make things real
spiffy and tell the whole story.

1198
00:59:19,613 --> 00:59:20,711
You first.

1199
00:59:20,713 --> 00:59:21,946
What whole story, Johnny?

1200
00:59:21,948 --> 00:59:23,280
What whole story?

1201
00:59:23,282 --> 00:59:25,684
Oh, I got him interested now.

1202
00:59:25,686 --> 00:59:27,885
Wilson, he's not missing.

1203
00:59:27,887 --> 00:59:29,854
I know he's dead.

1204
00:59:29,856 --> 00:59:30,856
That's right eagle eye.

1205
00:59:30,858 --> 00:59:31,689
He's dead.

1206
00:59:31,691 --> 00:59:32,524
(laughing)

1207
00:59:32,526 --> 00:59:34,693
Wait a minute, how did?

1208
00:59:34,695 --> 00:59:36,794
No one's seen
him for seven days.

1209
00:59:36,796 --> 00:59:39,430
There is no body, so no
one's gonna squat hot for it.

1210
00:59:39,432 --> 00:59:41,265
In fact the file in
Tate's office said

1211
00:59:41,267 --> 00:59:43,869
no one contacted the
police or the family

1212
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:46,238
for ransom which can
only mean one thing.

1213
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,840
Despite all appearances,
the Montemar family

1214
00:59:48,842 --> 00:59:50,608
has no money.

1215
00:59:50,610 --> 00:59:51,843
They don't?

1216
00:59:51,845 --> 00:59:53,245
No, of course.

1217
00:59:53,247 --> 00:59:55,180
That's why the diamond
is so important.

1218
00:59:55,182 --> 00:59:57,182
Anyone who sells that
diamond on the black market

1219
00:59:57,184 --> 00:59:59,316
would be set for life.

1220
00:59:59,318 --> 01:00:00,751
How do you know this?

1221
01:00:00,753 --> 01:00:02,454
My father never told me.

1222
01:00:02,456 --> 01:00:04,321
Obviously he wouldn't
tell you because that

1223
01:00:04,323 --> 01:00:08,526
would tie him to the Russian
mod and to illegal trafficking.

1224
01:00:08,528 --> 01:00:10,028
How do I know it?

1225
01:00:10,030 --> 01:00:14,466
Well he told it to someone
else in bed months ago.

1226
01:00:14,468 --> 01:00:17,669
And, a girl named
Nadia wrote it down.

1227
01:00:17,671 --> 01:00:19,470
It didn't make
sense until today.

1228
01:00:19,472 --> 01:00:22,209
(dramatic music)

1229
01:00:37,624 --> 01:00:39,557
All this time they've
been looking for Wilson,

1230
01:00:39,559 --> 01:00:41,459
we've been looking
for the diamond.

1231
01:00:41,461 --> 01:00:42,394
[Roland] We?

1232
01:00:42,396 --> 01:00:44,396
Oh yeah, that's the best part.

1233
01:00:44,398 --> 01:00:47,466
You're gonna die, and
there won't be no murder

1234
01:00:47,468 --> 01:00:48,666
'cause they won't find no body

1235
01:00:48,668 --> 01:00:49,767
because we always...

1236
01:00:49,769 --> 01:00:52,037
Who's we, Johnny?

1237
01:00:52,039 --> 01:00:52,870
You know.

1238
01:00:52,872 --> 01:00:53,704
Who's we?

1239
01:00:53,706 --> 01:00:54,539
Wait just wait.

1240
01:00:54,541 --> 01:00:55,372
Who is we?

1241
01:00:55,374 --> 01:00:56,207
You better tell me.

1242
01:00:56,209 --> 01:00:57,041
That's it Jennifer.

1243
01:00:57,043 --> 01:00:58,343
You're crazy.

1244
01:00:58,345 --> 01:00:59,811
You wanna know who
killed him, Drake?

1245
01:00:59,813 --> 01:01:02,079
Gun's not loaded, Roland.

1246
01:01:02,081 --> 01:01:04,048
What, you little bitch,
what are you doing?

1247
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:06,286
(smacking)

1248
01:01:07,787 --> 01:01:09,521
(dramatic music)

1249
01:01:09,523 --> 01:01:11,925
(clattering)

1250
01:01:13,526 --> 01:01:16,093
(smacking)

1251
01:01:16,095 --> 01:01:18,363
(thudding)

1252
01:01:18,365 --> 01:01:21,365
(dramatic music)

1253
01:01:21,367 --> 01:01:22,636
Son of a bitch.

1254
01:01:24,671 --> 01:01:27,175
(guns firing)

1255
01:01:29,075 --> 01:01:31,041
[Roland Voiceover] It
was the first and last time

1256
01:01:31,043 --> 01:01:33,477
Johnny ever touched a book.

1257
01:01:33,479 --> 01:01:36,249
(dramatic music)

1258
01:01:40,921 --> 01:01:43,191
(thudding)

1259
01:01:46,959 --> 01:01:49,026
(door squeaking)

1260
01:01:49,028 --> 01:01:51,798
(dramatic music)

1261
01:01:55,035 --> 01:01:55,870
Drake!

1262
01:02:00,106 --> 01:02:02,776
Oh I'll have to clean that up.

1263
01:02:06,046 --> 01:02:07,215
[Roland] Go.

1264
01:02:10,517 --> 01:02:12,950
(gasping)

1265
01:02:12,952 --> 01:02:14,820
That was exciting.

1266
01:02:14,822 --> 01:02:16,320
With you it usually is.

1267
01:02:16,322 --> 01:02:17,588
I would never in my life.

1268
01:02:17,590 --> 01:02:20,225
I mean I have seen some,
heard some crazy things

1269
01:02:20,227 --> 01:02:21,158
in my life.

1270
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,563
But, that was almost arousing.

1271
01:02:25,698 --> 01:02:26,800
Is that okay?

1272
01:02:27,668 --> 01:02:30,234
(laughing)

1273
01:02:30,236 --> 01:02:31,572
Oh my gosh, wow.

1274
01:02:34,675 --> 01:02:35,776
That was wow.

1275
01:02:36,776 --> 01:02:39,045
(laughing)

1276
01:02:40,814 --> 01:02:43,113
[Roland] He wants
to kill us I think.

1277
01:02:43,115 --> 01:02:45,887
(dramatic music)

1278
01:02:51,457 --> 01:02:53,024
Drake.

1279
01:02:53,026 --> 01:02:55,763
(dramatic music)

1280
01:03:16,148 --> 01:03:19,651
(latch clicking)

1281
01:03:19,653 --> 01:03:22,423
(dramatic music)

1282
01:03:27,059 --> 01:03:30,794
I swear I'm not trying
to be presumptuous,

1283
01:03:30,796 --> 01:03:34,064
but I honestly feel that
a motel is our best bet.

1284
01:03:34,066 --> 01:03:37,936
Oh you're not being
presumptuous, not at all.

1285
01:03:37,938 --> 01:03:41,374
(happy orchestral music)

1286
01:03:46,445 --> 01:03:49,213
[Roland Voiceover] It felt
right to be there nest to her.

1287
01:03:49,215 --> 01:03:52,651
With her sister, it had
been lust, a challenge.

1288
01:03:52,653 --> 01:03:55,854
But, with Jennifer,
even how her body moved

1289
01:03:55,856 --> 01:03:58,856
in such an unconsciously
alluring manner, melted me

1290
01:03:58,858 --> 01:04:01,695
in a way I didn't
have a name for.

1291
01:04:05,231 --> 01:04:07,567
Planning another invasion?

1292
01:04:08,834 --> 01:04:12,673
Well actually I was
kind of hoping you were.

1293
01:04:14,041 --> 01:04:16,744
(dramatic music)

1294
01:04:25,184 --> 01:04:26,519
How about India?

1295
01:04:32,224 --> 01:04:35,727
Katherine always
wanted to go to India

1296
01:04:35,729 --> 01:04:38,232
if she even knows where it is.

1297
01:04:39,967 --> 01:04:43,934
Just say anything to
get out of that house.

1298
01:04:43,936 --> 01:04:48,108
Jennifer if there's ever
gonna be an us anywhere,

1299
01:04:49,041 --> 01:04:51,242
you need to know everything.

1300
01:04:51,244 --> 01:04:52,209
Is there an us?

1301
01:04:52,211 --> 01:04:53,380
Isn't there?

1302
01:04:55,282 --> 01:04:58,619
I woke up that day,
and there was blood.

1303
01:05:02,488 --> 01:05:06,423
And, I don't know what happened,
or why I didn't wake up.

1304
01:05:06,425 --> 01:05:08,094
Maybe I was drugged.

1305
01:05:09,528 --> 01:05:13,367
But, I opened my eyes
and there was the blood,

1306
01:05:14,901 --> 01:05:16,637
her blood everywhere.

1307
01:05:19,939 --> 01:05:22,374
You have to believe me.

1308
01:05:22,376 --> 01:05:23,444
Not hurt her.

1309
01:05:24,910 --> 01:05:28,581
It kills me that I
haven't solved the crime.

1310
01:05:30,249 --> 01:05:32,986
And, then you
walked into my life

1311
01:05:37,423 --> 01:05:38,992
and things got all.

1312
01:05:40,026 --> 01:05:42,762
(dramatic music)

1313
01:06:01,548 --> 01:06:03,217
Nadia's death has,

1314
01:06:06,586 --> 01:06:09,756
forgive me Wilson
how do you say this,

1315
01:06:10,823 --> 01:06:12,226
changed the game.

1316
01:06:16,028 --> 01:06:19,733
And, your exorbitant
bet and continued excess

1317
01:06:22,001 --> 01:06:23,837
will bury your family.

1318
01:06:24,970 --> 01:06:27,707
(dramatic music)

1319
01:06:42,756 --> 01:06:45,192
So now you know we're poor.

1320
01:06:46,927 --> 01:06:49,093
Did he give you the diamond?

1321
01:06:49,095 --> 01:06:52,097
No, you'll never
get it from me.

1322
01:06:52,099 --> 01:06:54,198
(laughing)

1323
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:57,202
Okay as discussed,
we'll beat it out of him.

1324
01:06:57,204 --> 01:06:59,472
(smacking)

1325
01:07:02,142 --> 01:07:04,508
Where is the diamond?

1326
01:07:04,510 --> 01:07:05,742
Where is it?

1327
01:07:05,744 --> 01:07:08,515
(dramatic music)

1328
01:07:09,682 --> 01:07:13,387
All the love I have
for you is in that safe.

1329
01:07:15,488 --> 01:07:18,157
(dramatic music)

1330
01:07:21,227 --> 01:07:22,329
It's empty.

1331
01:07:25,631 --> 01:07:27,901
(smacking)

1332
01:07:29,568 --> 01:07:31,568
Take care of the body.

1333
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:33,504
(dramatic music)

1334
01:07:33,506 --> 01:07:35,675
(gasping)

1335
01:07:42,983 --> 01:07:45,753
(dramatic music)

1336
01:08:17,317 --> 01:08:19,887
(car starting)

1337
01:08:25,125 --> 01:08:26,958
[Roland Voiceover] My
dear, I cannot sleep.

1338
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:28,392
I have to go back to the house.

1339
01:08:28,394 --> 01:08:31,562
We need money, and I know where
my father has some hidden.

1340
01:08:31,564 --> 01:08:33,463
As much as you might
disagree, I cannot spend

1341
01:08:33,465 --> 01:08:36,133
the rest of my time
in this negligee.

1342
01:08:36,135 --> 01:08:40,206
I hope I'll be back before
you even read this, J.

1343
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:49,415
I need a cab.

1344
01:08:50,784 --> 01:08:51,916
So I followed her.

1345
01:08:51,918 --> 01:08:53,351
I was thinking
clearly enough to know

1346
01:08:53,353 --> 01:08:56,721
that after having her, I
wouldn't be thinking clearly.

1347
01:08:56,723 --> 01:08:59,958
You never let yourself fall
for a dame in our business

1348
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,892
let alone two in one week.

1349
01:09:01,894 --> 01:09:05,863
Sisters, (laughing)
naughty, naughty, naughty.

1350
01:09:05,865 --> 01:09:07,832
Bad for business.

1351
01:09:07,834 --> 01:09:10,568
I didn't follow her
because I didn't trust her.

1352
01:09:10,570 --> 01:09:12,869
I followed her because I had to.

1353
01:09:12,871 --> 01:09:15,373
She left a trail
of all my hopes.

1354
01:09:15,375 --> 01:09:17,645
Like crumbs in the forest.

1355
01:09:18,577 --> 01:09:20,144
Why is it so important?

1356
01:09:20,146 --> 01:09:22,779
Who cares about what's in
her little black book anyway?

1357
01:09:22,781 --> 01:09:23,648
(slapping)

1358
01:09:23,650 --> 01:09:25,115
You should care.

1359
01:09:25,117 --> 01:09:26,883
I'm in her little black book.

1360
01:09:26,885 --> 01:09:29,419
He is in her little
black book, and you

1361
01:09:29,421 --> 01:09:31,756
are in her little
black book too.

1362
01:09:31,758 --> 01:09:34,926
Tonight we are going
to go and relieve Drake

1363
01:09:34,928 --> 01:09:39,062
of his little get out
of jail free card.

1364
01:09:39,064 --> 01:09:43,568
Now fortunately, we
found blood in his house.

1365
01:09:43,570 --> 01:09:46,907
We have a proper
warrant for his office.

1366
01:09:51,678 --> 01:09:54,712
Operator, get me
the reporter's desk

1367
01:09:54,714 --> 01:09:56,550
at the Harold Express.

1368
01:10:00,152 --> 01:10:02,655
(tense music)

1369
01:10:08,394 --> 01:10:09,660
Let's wait.

1370
01:10:09,662 --> 01:10:12,165
(tense music)

1371
01:10:27,046 --> 01:10:28,680
Eyes on the road.

1372
01:10:28,682 --> 01:10:31,184
(tense music)

1373
01:10:36,156 --> 01:10:37,925
Katherine, son of a...

1374
01:10:38,857 --> 01:10:41,191
Does she take it all off, huh?

1375
01:10:41,193 --> 01:10:43,696
(tense music)

1376
01:10:51,870 --> 01:10:52,705
Drive.

1377
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:56,043
(tense music)

1378
01:11:22,201 --> 01:11:24,534
Boy, that was close.

1379
01:11:24,536 --> 01:11:25,970
You think.

1380
01:11:25,972 --> 01:11:28,474
(tense music)

1381
01:11:33,979 --> 01:11:35,747
You want me to wait?

1382
01:11:35,749 --> 01:11:38,483
Does this look like
my final destination?

1383
01:11:38,485 --> 01:11:40,251
That's sarcasm, right?

1384
01:11:40,253 --> 01:11:41,118
No.

1385
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:41,953
Really?

1386
01:11:41,955 --> 01:11:43,624
Yes, it's sarcasm.

1387
01:11:45,892 --> 01:11:48,458
Flash me if we find we're
not alone, all right?

1388
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:50,660
Do you want me to
blow the horn too?

1389
01:11:50,662 --> 01:11:52,499
There goes your tip.

1390
01:11:54,534 --> 01:11:56,937
I'll keep the fare running.

1391
01:11:59,638 --> 01:12:02,409
(dramatic music)

1392
01:12:57,464 --> 01:12:58,298
Dig.

1393
01:13:06,505 --> 01:13:09,276
(dramatic music)

1394
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:12,312
(digging)

1395
01:13:14,947 --> 01:13:17,651
(dramatic music)

1396
01:13:22,888 --> 01:13:25,458
(horn honking)

1397
01:13:26,425 --> 01:13:29,196
(dramatic music)

1398
01:13:57,523 --> 01:14:00,190
Everything okay, Bert?

1399
01:14:00,192 --> 01:14:02,894
Yeah, waiting on a fare.

1400
01:14:02,896 --> 01:14:04,294
(dramatic music)

1401
01:14:04,296 --> 01:14:06,467
(digging)

1402
01:14:10,803 --> 01:14:14,271
Well good luck
with that, Bert.

1403
01:14:14,273 --> 01:14:18,476
Listen we got an APB on
this guy, Roland Drake.

1404
01:14:18,478 --> 01:14:19,310
You seen him?

1405
01:14:19,312 --> 01:14:20,144
(horn honking)

1406
01:14:20,146 --> 01:14:21,044
Nope.

1407
01:14:21,046 --> 01:14:21,881
No.

1408
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:30,691
(dramatic music)

1409
01:14:52,545 --> 01:14:54,811
We need to get back to
the house I was casing.

1410
01:14:54,813 --> 01:14:57,248
Listen Drake, I don't
want to get you turned in,

1411
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:59,984
but I also don't want to be an
accomplice to your peepshow.

1412
01:14:59,986 --> 01:15:01,552
Why don't I take you
back to that motel,

1413
01:15:01,554 --> 01:15:03,421
and we'll call it even?

1414
01:15:03,423 --> 01:15:04,258
No.

1415
01:15:05,191 --> 01:15:07,928
(dramatic music)

1416
01:15:49,902 --> 01:15:53,173
Mr. Claude Allen,
I asked a question.

1417
01:15:55,441 --> 01:15:56,777
You will answer.

1418
01:15:58,177 --> 01:16:00,011
(fleshy thudding)

1419
01:16:00,013 --> 01:16:02,680
(grunting)

1420
01:16:02,682 --> 01:16:04,148
Drake's a good man, detective.

1421
01:16:04,150 --> 01:16:05,783
I think you railroaded him.

1422
01:16:05,785 --> 01:16:08,218
(smacking)

1423
01:16:08,220 --> 01:16:10,323
You will do what I say.

1424
01:16:12,692 --> 01:16:14,962
(smacking)

1425
01:16:15,995 --> 01:16:18,599
(flash popping)

1426
01:16:20,032 --> 01:16:21,699
Arrest them!

1427
01:16:21,701 --> 01:16:23,804
We didn't see anything.

1428
01:16:24,903 --> 01:16:27,203
You want us to
arrest the reporters?

1429
01:16:27,205 --> 01:16:28,038
My family.

1430
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:30,811
(dramatic music)

1431
01:16:40,452 --> 01:16:42,686
Extra, extra,
read all about it.

1432
01:16:42,688 --> 01:16:44,821
Hey Mr. Drake, up early?

1433
01:16:44,823 --> 01:16:46,390
Late.

1434
01:16:46,392 --> 01:16:48,426
How 'bout a newspaper Scotty.

1435
01:16:48,428 --> 01:16:50,560
Sure thing, lots of bad news.

1436
01:16:50,562 --> 01:16:53,129
It should be a good morning.

1437
01:16:53,131 --> 01:16:56,637
The DA guy who was
after you got his, huh?

1438
01:16:59,138 --> 01:17:01,238
I guess there is justice.

1439
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:02,739
Well I wouldn't
want to be caught dead

1440
01:17:02,741 --> 01:17:04,240
at his funeral.

1441
01:17:04,242 --> 01:17:07,013
(dramatic music)

1442
01:17:19,058 --> 01:17:21,124
[Roland Voiceover] I got
back just ahead of her, Lew.

1443
01:17:21,126 --> 01:17:23,327
My whole world had changed
knowing Katherine was

1444
01:17:23,329 --> 01:17:24,794
still in it.

1445
01:17:24,796 --> 01:17:26,730
I knew that my feelings
for Jennifer were deepening

1446
01:17:26,732 --> 01:17:28,899
clouding everything
including the job

1447
01:17:28,901 --> 01:17:30,671
she'd hired me to do.

1448
01:17:31,970 --> 01:17:33,002
Okay.

1449
01:17:33,004 --> 01:17:34,637
Oh good, you got my note.

1450
01:17:34,639 --> 01:17:35,976
We need to talk.

1451
01:17:37,677 --> 01:17:39,342
Oh yeah, we do.

1452
01:17:39,344 --> 01:17:40,810
Okay let me talk first.

1453
01:17:40,812 --> 01:17:44,047
So I went back to the
house, packed our bags.

1454
01:17:44,049 --> 01:17:46,652
Then I went to check on Johnny.

1455
01:17:48,054 --> 01:17:49,386
Roland, he wasn't there.

1456
01:17:49,388 --> 01:17:50,654
His body wasn't there.

1457
01:17:50,656 --> 01:17:54,057
There was no body, and
I searched that house.

1458
01:17:54,059 --> 01:17:56,593
And, there was no body.

1459
01:17:56,595 --> 01:17:58,162
And, it scared the
heck out of me,

1460
01:17:58,164 --> 01:18:00,463
so I got our stuff
and I came here.

1461
01:18:00,465 --> 01:18:03,637
I got out of there
as fast as I could.

1462
01:18:05,237 --> 01:18:08,040
Who do you think
moved the body?

1463
01:18:10,209 --> 01:18:11,675
Why are you looking
at me like that?

1464
01:18:11,677 --> 01:18:13,944
Who do you think moved the body?

1465
01:18:13,946 --> 01:18:15,948
Time for a confession.

1466
01:18:18,351 --> 01:18:20,684
Roland, I don't
even know what...

1467
01:18:20,686 --> 01:18:22,755
I followed you tonight.

1468
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:24,825
Why?

1469
01:18:26,893 --> 01:18:29,563
Katherine moved Johnny's body.

1470
01:18:30,463 --> 01:18:31,294
What?

1471
01:18:31,296 --> 01:18:32,829
Katherine.

1472
01:18:32,831 --> 01:18:34,030
You're sitting here
trying to tell me

1473
01:18:34,032 --> 01:18:35,231
she's still alive?

1474
01:18:35,233 --> 01:18:37,700
Look I know that
you love your sister.

1475
01:18:37,702 --> 01:18:38,968
So she's still alive?

1476
01:18:38,970 --> 01:18:40,604
Yeah, but you need
to consider the fact

1477
01:18:40,606 --> 01:18:42,506
that she might be
behind all of this.

1478
01:18:42,508 --> 01:18:44,608
She faked her own disappearance.

1479
01:18:44,610 --> 01:18:46,577
This is the genius
of this whole thing.

1480
01:18:46,579 --> 01:18:50,748
She's taking bodies and
burying them in open graves.

1481
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:52,252
No body, no crime.

1482
01:18:53,419 --> 01:18:55,118
Either that or she's
trying to protect me

1483
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:57,087
because that's what she's
done her entire life, Roland.

1484
01:18:57,089 --> 01:18:58,692
You don't know her.

1485
01:19:00,259 --> 01:19:04,427
Rivers, he told you about
some guy with the initials GG

1486
01:19:04,429 --> 01:19:05,729
when we were at dinner.

1487
01:19:05,731 --> 01:19:09,432
So if GG is so important
to keep secret,

1488
01:19:09,434 --> 01:19:11,435
maybe we should
be looking for GG.

1489
01:19:11,437 --> 01:19:14,841
That would be my
next course of action.

1490
01:19:16,008 --> 01:19:18,475
It's unmarked except for GG.

1491
01:19:18,477 --> 01:19:20,077
Unmarked mail's the best.

1492
01:19:20,079 --> 01:19:22,346
Those are the ones who
don't want to be found.

1493
01:19:22,348 --> 01:19:24,547
The man that attacked
us in my office,

1494
01:19:24,549 --> 01:19:27,418
he had a matchbook from here.

1495
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:30,190
(dramatic music)

1496
01:19:39,898 --> 01:19:41,097
There you go.

1497
01:19:41,099 --> 01:19:42,399
Take good care
of it for you, sir.

1498
01:19:42,401 --> 01:19:44,668
Don't worry, it's not ours.

1499
01:19:44,670 --> 01:19:47,407
(dramatic music)

1500
01:19:53,946 --> 01:19:55,879
Is Clark Gable staying here?

1501
01:19:55,881 --> 01:19:59,816
Sir, Clark Gable has not
checked into our establishment.

1502
01:19:59,818 --> 01:20:01,651
How 'bout William Powell?

1503
01:20:01,653 --> 01:20:04,888
Not the William Powell,
but a William Powell.

1504
01:20:04,890 --> 01:20:09,659
We may have a celebrity
or celebrities staying here.

1505
01:20:09,661 --> 01:20:12,061
Alas, if only you
knew their name,

1506
01:20:12,063 --> 01:20:14,398
then I could find him for you.

1507
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:17,501
Shall I call security and
show you the front door.

1508
01:20:17,503 --> 01:20:19,302
Nah, we saw it on the way in.

1509
01:20:19,304 --> 01:20:22,075
(dramatic music)

1510
01:20:29,381 --> 01:20:32,552
You know that five
spot you gave me?

1511
01:20:33,952 --> 01:20:37,754
Well someone just
arrived in your car.

1512
01:20:37,756 --> 01:20:39,690
Three, two, one, the
receptionist's finger

1513
01:20:39,692 --> 01:20:41,057
hesitated on one name.

1514
01:20:41,059 --> 01:20:43,360
Receptionist's fingers
always hesitate

1515
01:20:43,362 --> 01:20:46,430
on the one name they
don't want to reveal.

1516
01:20:46,432 --> 01:20:49,169
(dramatic music)

1517
01:20:50,635 --> 01:20:53,874
Two of them, they're
on their way up.

1518
01:20:56,008 --> 01:21:00,144
No idea, but they thought
they were very clever.

1519
01:21:00,146 --> 01:21:02,715
320, 321, wow you were right.

1520
01:21:04,549 --> 01:21:06,083
This is not your room.

1521
01:21:06,085 --> 01:21:09,052
Well that's a relief
because you look like you hog

1522
01:21:09,054 --> 01:21:10,020
the sheets.

1523
01:21:10,022 --> 01:21:12,422
We are here to see Mr. GG.

1524
01:21:12,424 --> 01:21:13,257
Mr. GG?

1525
01:21:13,259 --> 01:21:14,525
Yes.

1526
01:21:14,527 --> 01:21:16,993
I'm sorry Mr. GG
does not see anyone

1527
01:21:16,995 --> 01:21:19,430
without an invitation.

1528
01:21:19,432 --> 01:21:22,202
I got an invitation
right here.

1529
01:21:25,603 --> 01:21:27,236
Good luck.

1530
01:21:27,238 --> 01:21:29,976
(dramatic music)

1531
01:21:33,179 --> 01:21:34,011
Hi.

1532
01:21:34,013 --> 01:21:34,848
Whoa.

1533
01:21:38,483 --> 01:21:39,449
(speaking in a foreign language)

1534
01:21:39,451 --> 01:21:40,883
Jennifer.

1535
01:21:40,885 --> 01:21:44,288
I must say I am very,
very sorry of the events

1536
01:21:44,290 --> 01:21:46,890
of the Montemar
household have been

1537
01:21:46,892 --> 01:21:49,760
so deeply distressing for you.

1538
01:21:49,762 --> 01:21:53,933
And, the infamous Mr. Drake
scourge of the police.

1539
01:21:55,334 --> 01:21:57,570
(laughing)

1540
01:21:59,205 --> 01:22:03,376
I am Gavron Grozney a friend
of the family you could say.

1541
01:22:05,411 --> 01:22:08,481
Let's talk about
the Orlov diamond.

1542
01:22:10,415 --> 01:22:13,950
So now you and Miss
Montemar find yourselves

1543
01:22:13,952 --> 01:22:17,189
in quite an uncomfortable
position, no?

1544
01:22:18,223 --> 01:22:20,190
Really what would that be?

1545
01:22:20,192 --> 01:22:24,363
Everyone who comes in
contact with the diamond dies.

1546
01:22:25,363 --> 01:22:27,701
You're in contact with it.

1547
01:22:29,501 --> 01:22:33,069
You are not a
villain, Mr. Drake.

1548
01:22:33,071 --> 01:22:35,739
The whole city has
tried to make you to be

1549
01:22:35,741 --> 01:22:39,912
such a person, but try as you
might, I know you are not.

1550
01:22:42,781 --> 01:22:45,517
(dramatic music)

1551
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:52,388
The missing Russian girl,
Nadia, she was my niece.

1552
01:22:52,390 --> 01:22:56,627
Wait, you're the GG that's
all over her black book?

1553
01:22:56,629 --> 01:22:58,694
Not in the customer section,
but you're the busy man

1554
01:22:58,696 --> 01:23:00,366
she admired so much?

1555
01:23:02,034 --> 01:23:04,068
(speaking in a foreign language)

1556
01:23:04,070 --> 01:23:06,569
Information is the
currency of our business,

1557
01:23:06,571 --> 01:23:07,406
it's true.

1558
01:23:09,008 --> 01:23:10,908
You do not rise to become
the head of the Russian

1559
01:23:10,910 --> 01:23:12,876
black market without
knowing the value

1560
01:23:12,878 --> 01:23:16,446
of having crippling
information about the corrupt

1561
01:23:16,448 --> 01:23:18,617
and inelegant police force.

1562
01:23:20,585 --> 01:23:23,352
The pitifulness of
their own corruption

1563
01:23:23,354 --> 01:23:26,692
makes them vulnerable
to my temptations.

1564
01:23:30,763 --> 01:23:34,330
Was my father's diamond
one of your temptations?

1565
01:23:34,332 --> 01:23:35,168
Perhaps.

1566
01:23:36,602 --> 01:23:38,101
But, if you have come for
your father's diamond,

1567
01:23:38,103 --> 01:23:41,437
you have come
woefully unprepared.

1568
01:23:41,439 --> 01:23:45,409
In fact, I am insulted
that you have come to me

1569
01:23:45,411 --> 01:23:47,981
bringing nothing but this girl.

1570
01:23:50,482 --> 01:23:53,249
(laughing)

1571
01:23:53,251 --> 01:23:55,618
(dramatic music)

1572
01:23:55,620 --> 01:23:56,886
(laughing)

1573
01:23:56,888 --> 01:23:59,823
(metal clanging)

1574
01:23:59,825 --> 01:24:01,824
Ow, you stop!

1575
01:24:01,826 --> 01:24:02,860
You stop that.

1576
01:24:02,862 --> 01:24:03,793
You are woman.

1577
01:24:03,795 --> 01:24:05,128
And, you stop hitting me.

1578
01:24:05,130 --> 01:24:06,629
(clanging)

1579
01:24:06,631 --> 01:24:09,632
(yelling)

1580
01:24:09,634 --> 01:24:11,802
(clanging)

1581
01:24:11,804 --> 01:24:13,436
[Roland] Yeah,
but that's my girl.

1582
01:24:13,438 --> 01:24:14,904
[Jennifer] And now you
seem to find yourself

1583
01:24:14,906 --> 01:24:16,907
in a most
uncomfortable position.

1584
01:24:16,909 --> 01:24:19,243
(laughing)

1585
01:24:19,245 --> 01:24:20,743
(clapping)

1586
01:24:20,745 --> 01:24:23,547
Miss Montemar, I
am very impressed.

1587
01:24:23,549 --> 01:24:25,047
I'm very impressed.

1588
01:24:25,049 --> 01:24:28,552
I can see why Mr. Drake
is so anxious to claim you

1589
01:24:28,554 --> 01:24:30,453
for his very own.

1590
01:24:30,455 --> 01:24:31,687
Do you have it?

1591
01:24:31,689 --> 01:24:34,591
Indeed comrade,
it is close by.

1592
01:24:34,593 --> 01:24:35,792
Then give it to me.

1593
01:24:35,794 --> 01:24:36,827
No.

1594
01:24:36,829 --> 01:24:40,062
Be careful, they might shoot.

1595
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:42,134
This is very frightening.

1596
01:24:43,302 --> 01:24:46,602
It is close by, but
not within reach.

1597
01:24:46,604 --> 01:24:48,374
Then reach further.

1598
01:24:51,110 --> 01:24:56,046
It is where every item
of great value in antiquity

1599
01:24:56,048 --> 01:24:59,719
should be, but it is
however not on display.

1600
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:03,819
I'm not prepared to say more.

1601
01:25:03,821 --> 01:25:04,922
You don't need to.

1602
01:25:04,924 --> 01:25:06,722
A place with
antiquities, a museum.

1603
01:25:06,724 --> 01:25:08,992
Not on display, it's
just waiting to be sold

1604
01:25:08,994 --> 01:25:10,427
on the black market.

1605
01:25:10,429 --> 01:25:12,095
You are on a fool's errand.

1606
01:25:12,097 --> 01:25:15,101
My temptations
reach far and wide.

1607
01:25:16,235 --> 01:25:19,101
You are an honorable
man, Mr. Drake.

1608
01:25:19,103 --> 01:25:23,140
And, I meet so few of
them in this business,

1609
01:25:23,142 --> 01:25:26,579
but with her, I suspect
it will always be

1610
01:25:27,713 --> 01:25:29,381
unfinished business.

1611
01:25:30,348 --> 01:25:33,350
Yeah, that's our problem.

1612
01:25:33,352 --> 01:25:36,022
Sadly, one of many I'm afraid.

1613
01:25:36,955 --> 01:25:38,120
Listen to me.

1614
01:25:38,122 --> 01:25:39,623
Leave this place.

1615
01:25:39,625 --> 01:25:41,291
Leave this place,
leave the diamond,

1616
01:25:41,293 --> 01:25:43,694
leave the underbelly
of your pasts behind

1617
01:25:43,696 --> 01:25:46,797
and start again together
while you still can.

1618
01:25:46,799 --> 01:25:49,533
You two are very good together.

1619
01:25:49,535 --> 01:25:50,833
I came here for the diamond.

1620
01:25:50,835 --> 01:25:52,405
I want what's mine.

1621
01:25:55,073 --> 01:25:57,410
No matter who it destroys?

1622
01:25:59,577 --> 01:26:01,778
(dramatic music)

1623
01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:03,579
[Shadowed Man] Our
papers are being forced

1624
01:26:03,581 --> 01:26:05,949
to publish pictures of you

1625
01:26:05,951 --> 01:26:09,052
as you've seen fit to
draw us into the light

1626
01:26:09,054 --> 01:26:13,390
and have jeopardized our
largest transaction to date,

1627
01:26:13,392 --> 01:26:17,427
we have decided you are
permanently out any further

1628
01:26:17,429 --> 01:26:19,229
business arrangements.

1629
01:26:19,231 --> 01:26:23,402
To use the parlance of
chess, you are a pawn Tate.

1630
01:26:24,370 --> 01:26:26,302
You were always a pawn.

1631
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:29,709
And, you're being
removed from the board.

1632
01:26:33,946 --> 01:26:34,781
A pawn?

1633
01:26:37,215 --> 01:26:38,050
Me?

1634
01:26:40,419 --> 01:26:44,590
I knew all the pieces would
be here half an hour ago.

1635
01:26:46,659 --> 01:26:50,459
Uniformed officers went
to each and everyone

1636
01:26:50,461 --> 01:26:53,532
of your oh so
carefully hidden homes.

1637
01:26:54,866 --> 01:26:58,103
Hat in hand, they
knocked on your doors

1638
01:26:59,705 --> 01:27:02,004
and then asked your
wives with your children

1639
01:27:02,006 --> 01:27:05,745
woken from their beds
could they come inside?

1640
01:27:06,879 --> 01:27:08,615
Oh they had bad news.

1641
01:27:11,817 --> 01:27:15,988
Now if any one of you wish to
see any of your family again,

1642
01:27:21,059 --> 01:27:25,231
you will tell me where the
Orlov diamond is being taken

1643
01:27:27,732 --> 01:27:28,567
tonight.

1644
01:27:32,170 --> 01:27:35,340
Oh and as they say
in chess gentlemen,

1645
01:27:39,911 --> 01:27:40,746
checkmate.

1646
01:27:42,447 --> 01:27:43,779
Let's just find
the diamond and leave

1647
01:27:43,781 --> 01:27:45,282
the country together.

1648
01:27:45,284 --> 01:27:48,552
Listen if we return it to
India to the eye of Vishnu,

1649
01:27:48,554 --> 01:27:50,319
we will want for nothing.

1650
01:27:50,321 --> 01:27:54,858
Wait, we need to get
somethings clear here, sister.

1651
01:27:54,860 --> 01:27:57,828
I haven't solved one thing
you came to me to investigate.

1652
01:27:57,830 --> 01:27:59,162
What about your father?

1653
01:27:59,164 --> 01:28:01,832
What about the man
dead in my office?

1654
01:28:01,834 --> 01:28:04,568
And Katherine, I am not
stopping until I find out

1655
01:28:04,570 --> 01:28:06,203
how she's tied into all this.

1656
01:28:06,205 --> 01:28:08,105
Isn't that what you
were all fired up about?

1657
01:28:08,107 --> 01:28:08,939
So?

1658
01:28:08,941 --> 01:28:10,106
So?

1659
01:28:10,108 --> 01:28:11,641
After hearing Gavron,
a lot of things

1660
01:28:11,643 --> 01:28:15,148
are starting to make
sense, little things.

1661
01:28:16,348 --> 01:28:19,919
I came into possession
of a book awhile ago.

1662
01:28:22,787 --> 01:28:25,154
For months, it didn't make
sense, and then I met you.

1663
01:28:25,156 --> 01:28:26,989
All of a sudden,
random names, numbers,

1664
01:28:26,991 --> 01:28:28,891
information start popping up.

1665
01:28:28,893 --> 01:28:33,663
I think between that and you,
I could find this diamond.

1666
01:28:33,665 --> 01:28:35,731
I could bring down
Tate's operation.

1667
01:28:35,733 --> 01:28:37,333
And, I could finally
clean up this city

1668
01:28:37,335 --> 01:28:39,168
that you're suddenly in
such a hurray to leave.

1669
01:28:39,170 --> 01:28:41,637
And, get us both
killed in the process.

1670
01:28:41,639 --> 01:28:44,541
Gavron thought he was
being cryptic, all right.

1671
01:28:44,543 --> 01:28:47,010
But, that book is the
last missing puzzle piece

1672
01:28:47,012 --> 01:28:49,145
that makes all this make sense.

1673
01:28:49,147 --> 01:28:52,114
I could find your diamond.

1674
01:28:52,116 --> 01:28:53,350
Trust me?

1675
01:28:53,352 --> 01:28:54,351
(giggling)

1676
01:28:54,353 --> 01:28:55,886
I trust you.

1677
01:28:55,888 --> 01:28:58,658
(dramatic music)

1678
01:29:12,304 --> 01:29:13,636
Where to, mac?

1679
01:29:13,638 --> 01:29:16,605
1130 Linden Avenue,
Warehouse District.

1680
01:29:16,607 --> 01:29:18,742
(horn honking)

1681
01:29:18,744 --> 01:29:21,514
(dramatic music)

1682
01:29:35,928 --> 01:29:37,593
We're almost there.

1683
01:29:37,595 --> 01:29:39,695
How's the black book fit in?

1684
01:29:39,697 --> 01:29:42,097
So I broke into your house.

1685
01:29:42,099 --> 01:29:43,432
Broke into my house?

1686
01:29:43,434 --> 01:29:44,834
Best place to hide it.

1687
01:29:44,836 --> 01:29:46,002
Was at my house?

1688
01:29:46,004 --> 01:29:46,802
Yeah don't worry,
I didn't touch

1689
01:29:46,804 --> 01:29:47,937
your crappy brandy.

1690
01:29:47,939 --> 01:29:49,472
What about the Cognac?

1691
01:29:49,474 --> 01:29:51,007
It was good.

1692
01:29:51,009 --> 01:29:53,342
That's when I found out what
was so ingenious about Nadia.

1693
01:29:53,344 --> 01:29:55,511
All those random Russian
names all corresponded

1694
01:29:55,513 --> 01:29:56,980
to numbers.

1695
01:29:56,982 --> 01:29:59,983
Those numbers fit a grid that
matched the museum annex.

1696
01:29:59,985 --> 01:30:02,452
Gavron filled in the rest.

1697
01:30:02,454 --> 01:30:04,488
Jennifer and I didn't
know what we'd find

1698
01:30:04,490 --> 01:30:07,757
at the secret museum
annex, Katherine, Tate,

1699
01:30:07,759 --> 01:30:10,025
or hopefully just the diamond.

1700
01:30:10,027 --> 01:30:12,061
We only knew that we
had to get it tonight.

1701
01:30:12,063 --> 01:30:14,631
Or, the promise of the
jewel and a new life

1702
01:30:14,633 --> 01:30:16,900
would fade into the
darkness of the black market

1703
01:30:16,902 --> 01:30:18,571
and be lost forever.

1704
01:30:20,037 --> 01:30:22,707
(ominous music)

1705
01:30:26,210 --> 01:30:29,111
I want these wires
cut, the alarms off,

1706
01:30:29,113 --> 01:30:31,384
this building shutdown now.

1707
01:30:33,619 --> 01:30:35,584
Am I understood?

1708
01:30:35,586 --> 01:30:37,087
Yes, sir.

1709
01:30:37,089 --> 01:30:40,457
(ominous music)

1710
01:30:40,459 --> 01:30:41,992
Excuse me sir,
what are you doing?

1711
01:30:41,994 --> 01:30:43,092
No alarm has been set off.

1712
01:30:43,094 --> 01:30:44,660
(gun firing)

1713
01:30:44,662 --> 01:30:45,831
Alarmed yet.

1714
01:30:47,299 --> 01:30:49,802
(guns firing)

1715
01:30:54,305 --> 01:30:56,907
(dramatic music)

1716
01:30:56,909 --> 01:30:59,411
(guns firing)

1717
01:31:00,646 --> 01:31:02,846
(dramatic music)

1718
01:31:02,848 --> 01:31:05,351
(guns firing)

1719
01:31:06,317 --> 01:31:08,150
(dramatic music)

1720
01:31:08,152 --> 01:31:10,720
(guns firing)

1721
01:31:10,722 --> 01:31:13,459
(dramatic music)

1722
01:31:15,527 --> 01:31:18,261
(guns firing)

1723
01:31:18,263 --> 01:31:21,000
(dramatic music)

1724
01:31:30,142 --> 01:31:32,644
(guns firing)

1725
01:31:45,823 --> 01:31:47,524
(vase shattering)

1726
01:31:47,526 --> 01:31:50,028
(guns firing)

1727
01:31:57,068 --> 01:31:57,934
Drake!

1728
01:31:57,936 --> 01:32:00,035
(gun firing)

1729
01:32:00,037 --> 01:32:01,370
If only we had guns.

1730
01:32:01,372 --> 01:32:04,474
(dramatic music)

1731
01:32:04,476 --> 01:32:05,408
I love you.

1732
01:32:05,410 --> 01:32:06,245
Ditto.

1733
01:32:07,579 --> 01:32:10,081
(guns firing)

1734
01:32:14,085 --> 01:32:16,453
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

1735
01:32:16,455 --> 01:32:19,254
(dramatic music)

1736
01:32:19,256 --> 01:32:21,760
(guns firing)

1737
01:32:24,295 --> 01:32:26,930
(dramatic music)

1738
01:32:26,932 --> 01:32:29,434
(guns firing)

1739
01:32:46,652 --> 01:32:48,885
(laughing)

1740
01:32:48,887 --> 01:32:51,488
(guns firing)

1741
01:32:51,490 --> 01:32:54,090
(dramatic music)

1742
01:32:54,092 --> 01:32:56,595
(guns firing)

1743
01:32:57,629 --> 01:33:00,366
(dramatic music)

1744
01:33:04,769 --> 01:33:07,636
(gun firing)

1745
01:33:07,638 --> 01:33:10,606
Tate, you can't
get away with this!

1746
01:33:10,608 --> 01:33:14,780
Once again, your persistence
will be your undoing.

1747
01:33:16,548 --> 01:33:17,883
It's over Drake!

1748
01:33:19,651 --> 01:33:21,153
You're late again.

1749
01:33:25,022 --> 01:33:27,724
(gun firing)

1750
01:33:27,726 --> 01:33:30,463
(dramatic music)

1751
01:33:34,232 --> 01:33:37,266
How does if feel to be just like

1752
01:33:37,268 --> 01:33:39,735
a frightened little
Russian girl pleading

1753
01:33:39,737 --> 01:33:44,740
for your worthless life and
no one's here to save you?

1754
01:33:44,742 --> 01:33:45,708
I'm not pleading.

1755
01:33:45,710 --> 01:33:47,310
(smacking)

1756
01:33:47,312 --> 01:33:48,377
(grunting)

1757
01:33:48,379 --> 01:33:50,012
(coughing)

1758
01:33:50,014 --> 01:33:53,048
Speaking of little
girls, you hit like one.

1759
01:33:53,050 --> 01:33:54,450
(laughing)

1760
01:33:54,452 --> 01:33:56,618
You know if you
were as half as smart

1761
01:33:56,620 --> 01:33:59,455
as your mouth, you would
have played ball with us

1762
01:33:59,457 --> 01:34:01,458
like your partner did.

1763
01:34:01,460 --> 01:34:02,525
(smacking)

1764
01:34:02,527 --> 01:34:04,797
(grunting)

1765
01:34:05,930 --> 01:34:09,434
You never did get
anything right, did you?

1766
01:34:10,602 --> 01:34:12,671
Well now this is the end.

1767
01:34:14,371 --> 01:34:15,939
(dramatic music)

1768
01:34:15,941 --> 01:34:17,106
(gun firing)

1769
01:34:17,108 --> 01:34:18,307
(groaning)

1770
01:34:18,309 --> 01:34:19,575
(gun firing)

1771
01:34:19,577 --> 01:34:22,348
(dramatic music)

1772
01:34:23,714 --> 01:34:25,582
(smacking)

1773
01:34:25,584 --> 01:34:28,217
(dramatic music)

1774
01:34:28,219 --> 01:34:29,718
Good luck with that.

1775
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:30,686
Come on.

1776
01:34:30,688 --> 01:34:31,523
Okay.

1777
01:34:32,557 --> 01:34:35,061
(tense music)

1778
01:34:49,674 --> 01:34:52,242
(gasping)

1779
01:34:52,244 --> 01:34:54,944
Looks like you're
at a dead end.

1780
01:34:54,946 --> 01:34:57,216
Wow, eye for detail, Lew.

1781
01:34:58,650 --> 01:35:02,552
Miss Montemar, I've been
admiring you from afar.

1782
01:35:02,554 --> 01:35:05,622
Of course, that's how
I get to know people.

1783
01:35:05,624 --> 01:35:09,057
But, most of all I've been
admiring that diamond.

1784
01:35:09,059 --> 01:35:11,293
I understand it's priceless.

1785
01:35:11,295 --> 01:35:13,631
So what's half of priceless?

1786
01:35:16,334 --> 01:35:17,667
Even you wouldn't.

1787
01:35:17,669 --> 01:35:19,636
Don't underestimate me, buddy.

1788
01:35:19,638 --> 01:35:21,904
I've always been willing
to do what you couldn't.

1789
01:35:21,906 --> 01:35:23,972
That's why I'm the one
with the nice suit,

1790
01:35:23,974 --> 01:35:27,443
the car, the
office, and the gun.

1791
01:35:27,445 --> 01:35:29,712
We were friends.

1792
01:35:29,714 --> 01:35:32,148
You can't ask me to choose.

1793
01:35:32,150 --> 01:35:34,284
Well profiting from an
unfortunate situation's

1794
01:35:34,286 --> 01:35:37,287
the only way to stay
sane in a city like this.

1795
01:35:37,289 --> 01:35:38,788
It doesn't take a
lot of detective work

1796
01:35:38,790 --> 01:35:41,791
to know you're sweet on
her, but I'm warning you.

1797
01:35:41,793 --> 01:35:43,461
You can't trust her.

1798
01:35:44,696 --> 01:35:47,297
You'll thank me for
shooting her, Roland.

1799
01:35:47,299 --> 01:35:50,970
As I say, we'll each
have half of priceless.

1800
01:35:53,071 --> 01:35:54,570
(hammer cocking)

1801
01:35:54,572 --> 01:35:55,704
(dramatic music)

1802
01:35:55,706 --> 01:35:56,506
Give it to me.

1803
01:35:56,508 --> 01:35:59,275
(guns firing)

1804
01:35:59,277 --> 01:36:02,014
(dramatic music)

1805
01:36:10,455 --> 01:36:11,457
Hey buddy.

1806
01:36:14,759 --> 01:36:16,124
Sorry Lew.

1807
01:36:16,126 --> 01:36:17,726
(gun firing)

1808
01:36:17,728 --> 01:36:19,628
She's priceless.

1809
01:36:19,630 --> 01:36:22,367
(dramatic music)

1810
01:36:24,870 --> 01:36:26,138
Tate is dead.

1811
01:36:29,107 --> 01:36:31,940
I know I must've been a thorn
in your side as a partner.

1812
01:36:31,942 --> 01:36:34,711
You made me too good a
detective to believe that.

1813
01:36:34,713 --> 01:36:36,212
(laughing)

1814
01:36:36,214 --> 01:36:40,085
A bull in a china shop can
be useful if not aggravating.

1815
01:36:41,486 --> 01:36:42,918
We have the diamond.

1816
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:44,020
This is our chance.

1817
01:36:44,022 --> 01:36:44,857
Let's go.

1818
01:36:46,323 --> 01:36:48,958
Wait, there's a trail
of bodies leading to you.

1819
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:51,727
I've seen Katherine
Montemar alive.

1820
01:36:51,729 --> 01:36:53,529
Come on, who sent
you the photos?

1821
01:36:53,531 --> 01:36:55,931
Who murdered your
mother, your father?

1822
01:36:55,933 --> 01:36:57,233
It doesn't matter.

1823
01:36:57,235 --> 01:37:00,238
We have the diamond,
and I love you.

1824
01:37:01,238 --> 01:37:02,241
So let's go.

1825
01:37:03,308 --> 01:37:04,274
No.

1826
01:37:04,276 --> 01:37:05,507
I can meet you.

1827
01:37:05,509 --> 01:37:08,914
Remember the time I
told you to trust me?

1828
01:37:11,148 --> 01:37:13,650
And bring the world map too.

1829
01:37:13,652 --> 01:37:16,388
(dramatic music)

1830
01:37:20,058 --> 01:37:22,824
And you, I know what you want.

1831
01:37:22,826 --> 01:37:26,229
Pull yourself together
and meet me at my office.

1832
01:37:26,231 --> 01:37:28,564
(dramatic music)

1833
01:37:28,566 --> 01:37:31,070
(tense music)

1834
01:37:47,285 --> 01:37:49,354
Okay, so here's the plan.

1835
01:37:50,388 --> 01:37:53,623
I got a numbered key, number 77.

1836
01:37:53,625 --> 01:37:55,394
I got two boxes here.

1837
01:37:57,262 --> 01:37:59,695
One of them's the black book.

1838
01:37:59,697 --> 01:38:02,664
The other one is a letter.

1839
01:38:02,666 --> 01:38:04,734
I want both of
these to get to Lew.

1840
01:38:04,736 --> 01:38:07,537
If anything happens to
me, he'll know what to do.

1841
01:38:07,539 --> 01:38:10,309
(dramatic music)

1842
01:38:13,812 --> 01:38:15,278
Take me to the cemetery.

1843
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:16,412
She's still alive.

1844
01:38:16,414 --> 01:38:17,713
This better be good.

1845
01:38:17,715 --> 01:38:19,382
I wish I could say it was.

1846
01:38:19,384 --> 01:38:22,154
(dramatic music)

1847
01:38:23,554 --> 01:38:24,619
Lots of bad news.

1848
01:38:24,621 --> 01:38:25,855
It should be a good morning.

1849
01:38:25,857 --> 01:38:28,458
The DA guy who was
after you got his, huh?

1850
01:38:28,460 --> 01:38:30,562
I guess there is justice.

1851
01:38:32,397 --> 01:38:33,663
[Roland Voiceover] Katherine.

1852
01:38:33,665 --> 01:38:34,931
That was the beauty
of Katherine's plan.

1853
01:38:34,933 --> 01:38:37,100
She was using the open
graves to bury bodies

1854
01:38:37,102 --> 01:38:39,435
so no one would look there.

1855
01:38:39,437 --> 01:38:41,173
The plan was perfect.

1856
01:38:46,210 --> 01:38:49,511
How much do I believe
Jennifer anymore?

1857
01:38:49,513 --> 01:38:51,547
She told me she didn't know him,

1858
01:38:51,549 --> 01:38:53,052
then she shot him.

1859
01:38:54,652 --> 01:38:57,056
This is Evergreen Cemetery.

1860
01:38:58,756 --> 01:39:01,927
If Katherine is the
key, and trust me,

1861
01:39:03,894 --> 01:39:05,727
I've learned enough
about this family to know

1862
01:39:05,729 --> 01:39:10,666
that someone's gonna be
at the DA's grave tonight.

1863
01:39:10,668 --> 01:39:13,069
I have more than
one gun, you know.

1864
01:39:13,071 --> 01:39:15,137
I was counting on it Lew.

1865
01:39:15,139 --> 01:39:18,740
I'll take priceless over
half of priceless any day.

1866
01:39:18,742 --> 01:39:20,575
Give me the black book Roland.

1867
01:39:20,577 --> 01:39:22,145
You don't want the diamond?

1868
01:39:22,147 --> 01:39:23,279
No.

1869
01:39:23,281 --> 01:39:24,713
What would I do with it?

1870
01:39:24,715 --> 01:39:27,350
I couldn't even buy a
sandwich with that diamond.

1871
01:39:27,352 --> 01:39:30,953
But, the black book,
now that's everything

1872
01:39:30,955 --> 01:39:32,024
in this city.

1873
01:39:33,191 --> 01:39:34,724
I guess you can
trade in ruining lives

1874
01:39:34,726 --> 01:39:36,562
for cash forever, huh?

1875
01:39:37,762 --> 01:39:39,494
Where I'm going I don't need it.

1876
01:39:39,496 --> 01:39:41,064
I'm not coming back.

1877
01:39:41,066 --> 01:39:42,233
Where is it?

1878
01:39:45,903 --> 01:39:48,437
Don't think I won't use this.

1879
01:39:48,439 --> 01:39:51,210
And, here I
thought we made up.

1880
01:39:54,379 --> 01:39:56,145
Go to the drop box,
the one we used

1881
01:39:56,147 --> 01:39:59,015
when we were in
business together.

1882
01:39:59,017 --> 01:40:02,084
I'm not fond of you Roland.

1883
01:40:02,086 --> 01:40:04,356
I think you should go away.

1884
01:40:06,624 --> 01:40:10,795
But, with her, someplace
bright where you can see things

1885
01:40:12,162 --> 01:40:12,997
coming.

1886
01:40:14,299 --> 01:40:18,303
You always were a little
too shiny for the city.

1887
01:40:19,804 --> 01:40:23,976
In this world, the one
that cares more always loses.

1888
01:40:25,143 --> 01:40:27,846
The one with the
gun always wins.

1889
01:40:29,179 --> 01:40:30,014
Get out.

1890
01:40:32,349 --> 01:40:35,687
Katherine, you're
going away for good.

1891
01:40:40,090 --> 01:40:42,925
Roland, do you love me?

1892
01:40:42,927 --> 01:40:44,659
Nobody needs to know.

1893
01:40:44,661 --> 01:40:46,428
My family never told
anybody that Katherine

1894
01:40:46,430 --> 01:40:48,064
committed suicide.

1895
01:40:48,066 --> 01:40:49,966
I can be Katherine.

1896
01:40:49,968 --> 01:40:52,168
I can go into the
attorney's office.

1897
01:40:52,170 --> 01:40:53,401
I can get the house.

1898
01:40:53,403 --> 01:40:56,105
I can get everything,
and we can just go away.

1899
01:40:56,107 --> 01:40:57,873
We can leave here together.

1900
01:40:57,875 --> 01:40:59,641
I loved you.

1901
01:40:59,643 --> 01:41:00,478
Not now.

1902
01:41:01,812 --> 01:41:05,383
They need to know, and
you need to go away.

1903
01:41:08,085 --> 01:41:10,520
(fleshy sucking)

1904
01:41:10,522 --> 01:41:12,989
I can be Katherine for you.

1905
01:41:12,991 --> 01:41:14,856
You can have both of us.

1906
01:41:14,858 --> 01:41:17,629
(dramatic music)

1907
01:41:20,631 --> 01:41:21,465
No.

1908
01:41:24,536 --> 01:41:26,138
I'm sorry, Drake.

1909
01:41:27,705 --> 01:41:29,004
You made me do this.

1910
01:41:29,006 --> 01:41:31,740
(crying)

1911
01:41:31,742 --> 01:41:32,708
You made me.

1912
01:41:32,710 --> 01:41:35,377
(crying)

1913
01:41:35,379 --> 01:41:36,811
I'm so sorry.

1914
01:41:36,813 --> 01:41:38,883
(crying)

1915
01:41:42,387 --> 01:41:43,388
I loved you.

1916
01:41:44,455 --> 01:41:46,525
(crying)

1917
01:41:51,396 --> 01:41:54,166
(dramatic music)

1918
01:41:55,433 --> 01:41:57,033
Lew, wait at your house.

1919
01:41:57,035 --> 01:41:59,537
It will arrive at dawn, Drake.

1920
01:42:03,273 --> 01:42:04,209
Son of a...

1921
01:42:10,113 --> 01:42:12,851
(dramatic music)

1922
01:42:42,914 --> 01:42:44,579
[Roland] I hope with all
that's left of my heart

1923
01:42:44,581 --> 01:42:48,251
that we're on our way to India,
and that you never see this.

1924
01:42:48,253 --> 01:42:50,352
If you are reading this,
I didn't get to cancel

1925
01:42:50,354 --> 01:42:52,855
the package with
this letter to Lew

1926
01:42:52,857 --> 01:42:56,659
because I was wrong
about you and about love.

1927
01:42:56,661 --> 01:42:59,361
But, I guess I was wrong
about a lot of things.

1928
01:42:59,363 --> 01:43:02,099
(dramatic music)

1929
01:43:25,156 --> 01:43:27,890
It was always about the diamond.

1930
01:43:27,892 --> 01:43:30,359
I was just part of a plan
that was hard and faceted

1931
01:43:30,361 --> 01:43:33,599
and icy as your
feelings and that rock.

1932
01:43:35,165 --> 01:43:37,932
You toyed with my heart
with fickle carelessness

1933
01:43:37,934 --> 01:43:39,401
and I fell for it.

1934
01:43:39,403 --> 01:43:42,139
(dramatic music)

1935
01:43:56,586 --> 01:43:59,491
(thunder crashing)

1936
01:44:00,857 --> 01:44:03,628
(dramatic music)

1937
01:44:08,532 --> 01:44:11,467
(thunder crashing)

1938
01:44:11,469 --> 01:44:14,239
(dramatic music)

1939
01:44:36,126 --> 01:44:38,026
They say a kiss is the
way we love someone

1940
01:44:38,028 --> 01:44:40,829
when words are not enough.

1941
01:44:40,831 --> 01:44:44,033
Well this letter is my
kiss, my confession of love,

1942
01:44:44,035 --> 01:44:46,534
and your confession of guilt.

1943
01:44:46,536 --> 01:44:47,638
I was a fool.

1944
01:44:48,805 --> 01:44:51,707
I wanted you, but I
wanted the truth more.

1945
01:44:51,709 --> 01:44:54,446
(dramatic music)

1946
01:44:55,912 --> 01:44:58,047
Miss Montemar, mam?

1947
01:44:58,049 --> 01:45:00,048
(dramatic music)

1948
01:45:00,050 --> 01:45:02,851
[Roland] I finally know
exactly why you hired me,

1949
01:45:02,853 --> 01:45:06,187
to be your fall guy,
and I fell all right.

1950
01:45:06,189 --> 01:45:08,257
I guess you were right about me.

1951
01:45:08,259 --> 01:45:10,392
I am good at my job.

1952
01:45:10,394 --> 01:45:13,529
I knew you were trouble,
but then trouble

1953
01:45:13,531 --> 01:45:14,864
was my business.

1954
01:45:14,866 --> 01:45:18,537
(dramatic orchestral music)

1955
01:45:21,460 --> 01:45:26,460
Subtitles by explosiveskull

1956
01:47:48,251 --> 01:47:51,522
