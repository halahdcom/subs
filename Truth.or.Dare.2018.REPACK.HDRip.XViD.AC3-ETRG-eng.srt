00:01:21,638 --> 00:01:23,808
Can I get a pack of Morleys?

3
00:01:26,644 --> 00:01:29,178
<i>¿Cigarillos? ¿Comprende?</i>

4
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,815
<i>Sí, sí.</i>

5
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,024
Yeah.

6
00:01:53,204 --> 00:01:55,505
Truth or dare, Giselle?

7
00:01:55,507 --> 00:01:56,905
Please.

8
00:01:56,907 --> 00:01:59,041
Please, I don't want
to play anymore. Please.

9
00:01:59,043 --> 00:02:02,612
Truth... or... dare?

10
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,824
Oh, no! No!

11
00:02:14,826 --> 00:02:16,528
I'm sorry.
I don't have a choice.

12
00:02:30,107 --> 00:02:32,107
<i>You do have a choice.</i>

13
00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:34,809
And I can honestly say
the pure joy you will feel

14
00:02:34,811 --> 00:02:36,312
from literally building
someone's home,

15
00:02:36,314 --> 00:02:39,181
it will stay with you
for the rest of your life.

16
00:02:39,183 --> 00:02:41,183
Unlike all the nights
you won't remember

17
00:02:41,185 --> 00:02:44,119
and the hangovers you're
really gonna want to forget.

18
00:02:44,121 --> 00:02:46,154
So, for a spring break
alternative

19
00:02:46,156 --> 00:02:48,089
that is really good
for the soul,

20
00:02:48,091 --> 00:02:51,627
please consider
Habitat for Humanity.

21
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:52,895
Okay.

22
00:02:52,897 --> 00:02:54,897
Hey.

23
00:02:54,899 --> 00:02:56,798
Hi.

24
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,169
So, I've been doing some
thinking, and I forgive you.

25
00:03:00,171 --> 00:03:02,872
- For what?
- For saying you can't come on spring break.

26
00:03:02,874 --> 00:03:05,206
I know you didn't mean it.

27
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:07,009
- Markie.
- Yeah?

28
00:03:07,011 --> 00:03:09,744
I love you so much,
you know that.

29
00:03:09,746 --> 00:03:11,647
But I can't. I already
signed up for Habitat.

30
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,315
- I know.
- Yeah. I'm a trip leader.

31
00:03:13,317 --> 00:03:16,685
You know what, I know, I know.
It's just...

32
00:03:16,687 --> 00:03:20,755
this is our last
spring break, ever.

33
00:03:20,757 --> 00:03:23,825
And the thought of doing that
without my best friend...

34
00:03:23,827 --> 00:03:25,327
that breaks my heart.

35
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:27,997
Since high school, you and I
haven't spent more than a week

36
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,198
away from each other.

37
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,734
This is our last chance
to have some fun

38
00:03:31,736 --> 00:03:34,236
before life tears us apart.

39
00:03:34,238 --> 00:03:37,139
I mean, when you
put it that way...

40
00:03:37,141 --> 00:03:39,742
- Yeah.
- No. Still can't.

41
00:03:39,744 --> 00:03:42,310
Okay. Olivia,
what ever happened to

42
00:03:42,312 --> 00:03:44,046
"between you and the world,
I choose you"?

43
00:03:44,048 --> 00:03:45,280
- I still mean that.
- Do you?

44
00:03:45,282 --> 00:03:47,349
Yes, most of the time.
This just...

45
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:49,684
you know, isn't
one of those times.

46
00:03:49,686 --> 00:03:51,386
Okay. All right.
You know, I really didn't want

47
00:03:51,388 --> 00:03:53,990
to have to do this, but
you've left me no other choice.

48
00:03:53,992 --> 00:03:55,190
I un-signed you up.

49
00:03:55,192 --> 00:03:57,892
- You what?
- Yeah.

50
00:03:57,894 --> 00:03:59,729
I told Habitat
you got shingles.

51
00:03:59,731 --> 00:04:02,030
Which is kind of funny,
'cause roofs have shingles...

52
00:04:02,032 --> 00:04:03,231
Markie, that is so...

53
00:04:03,233 --> 00:04:05,735
- Brilliant.
- Thank you.

54
00:04:05,737 --> 00:04:07,937
Okay, if you come with us
for this one week

55
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:11,407
of spring break debauchery, we
will all build houses with you

56
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:12,908
for two weeks over the summer.

57
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,343
- We said one week.
- We said two.

58
00:04:14,345 --> 00:04:15,810
It'll help with your
med school applications.

59
00:04:15,812 --> 00:04:17,078
- Like I need the help.
- He's in.

60
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,347
Full 14 days.

61
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:19,347
So what's it gonna be, Liv?

62
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:21,817
I mean, your feeble set
of hands for one week,

63
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:23,753
or all of ours for two?

64
00:04:23,755 --> 00:04:25,121
I mean, you're really
just being selfish

65
00:04:25,123 --> 00:04:27,156
if you don't come with us.

66
00:04:34,332 --> 00:04:35,798
Oh, my God.

67
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,233
What did you put in here?

68
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,767
Shoes.

69
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:40,902
- It worked?
- Well, that depends.

70
00:04:40,904 --> 00:04:42,904
Are you really gonna help me
build houses this summer?

71
00:04:42,906 --> 00:04:44,739
You had me at
"boys with tools."

72
00:04:44,741 --> 00:04:47,008
And Markie's nothing
if not persistent.

73
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:50,047
Yep, that is
her most annoying quality.

74
00:04:53,017 --> 00:04:55,084
Glad you're with us,
Girl Scout.

75
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,019
Well, you know we've always
been a package deal.

76
00:04:57,021 --> 00:04:59,854
Oh, yeah.
I'm well aware of that.

77
00:04:59,856 --> 00:05:01,890
- Are you?
- Yeah. I'm okay with it.

78
00:05:01,892 --> 00:05:03,392
Mm.

79
00:05:03,394 --> 00:05:05,260
- You ready?
- So ready.

80
00:05:05,262 --> 00:05:07,697
- Okay, let's go.
- Let's do it.

81
00:05:08,832 --> 00:05:10,933
- Do we have everything?
- Yeah.

82
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,868
Now we do.

83
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,104
Ow, ow! Spring break, bitches!

84
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:18,808
That's right, bitches!

85
00:05:28,853 --> 00:05:31,820
<i>¡Viva la Mexico!</i>

86
00:05:31,822 --> 00:05:33,789
<i>There it is!</i>

87
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,724
<i>We're in Mexico.</i>

88
00:05:35,726 --> 00:05:38,493
- Yay! - Rosarito! Spring break!
- Spring break!

89
00:05:38,495 --> 00:05:41,397
Who's ready for some cervezas?

90
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:44,299
- Margaritas.
- Actually, this is, like, our fourth.

91
00:05:44,301 --> 00:05:45,500
I love you.

92
00:05:45,502 --> 00:05:47,335
- I love you.
- <i>Such a babe.</i>

93
00:05:47,337 --> 00:05:50,339
- <i>My God.</i>
- <i>What about me?</i>

94
00:05:50,341 --> 00:05:51,873
<i>Mexico!</i>

95
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,976
Tyson... is about to run
into the water

96
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,844
and get eaten by a shark.

97
00:05:55,846 --> 00:05:58,113
- <i>Spring break!</i>
- <i>Beer run. Let's go!</i>

98
00:05:58,115 --> 00:06:01,082
We're not drunk yet.

99
00:06:01,084 --> 00:06:02,851
Are you straight? Are you
straight? Are you straight?

100
00:06:02,853 --> 00:06:04,253
All poles, no holes.

101
00:06:04,255 --> 00:06:05,854
You know that.

102
00:06:05,856 --> 00:06:09,125
- <i>Get a room.</i>
- Lonely souls here at the bar.

103
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:10,859
- Drink. Drink.
- <i>Oh.</i>

104
00:06:10,861 --> 00:06:13,361
Sand dollar!
Lucky charm.

105
00:06:13,363 --> 00:06:16,332
- Sober friend right here.
- Huh? Not!

106
00:06:21,505 --> 00:06:24,472
There, there. Yeah!
Oh, shit! Oh, my...

107
00:06:24,474 --> 00:06:27,041
- <i>I love it.</i>
- <i>Nice!</i>

108
00:06:29,312 --> 00:06:31,147
Mwah! Whoo!

109
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:32,481
If you guys watch this later,

110
00:06:32,483 --> 00:06:33,983
- I love you, Markie.
- Soul brothers.

111
00:06:33,985 --> 00:06:35,818
Love you, Liv.

112
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,486
- Love you, Pen. Love you, Brad. I love you, Ty.
- Yes, we are...

113
00:06:38,488 --> 00:06:41,457
Let's leave these losers
behind. Let's go.

114
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:42,957
No, I just want to go
to one more bar.

115
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,960
- <i>¡Olé!</i>
- <i>¡Olé!</i>

116
00:06:44,962 --> 00:06:46,227
Oh, I want to lay you.

117
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:47,897
Let's go back to the hotel.
Come on.

118
00:06:58,276 --> 00:06:59,974
<i>¡Uno! ¡Dos!</i>

119
00:06:59,976 --> 00:07:01,844
<i>¡Uno, dos, tres, cuatro!</i>

120
00:07:11,955 --> 00:07:13,455
Wow.

121
00:07:13,457 --> 00:07:15,293
They are really going for it.

122
00:07:16,324 --> 00:07:19,094
Well, if you can't beat 'em...

123
00:07:19,096 --> 00:07:21,897
- Oh-hoo-hoo. - Mm-hmm.
- Just like that?

124
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:35,344
Okay. Tell me what's going on.

125
00:07:35,346 --> 00:07:39,147
Uh, last night
in Mexico, and...

126
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:41,450
and we're the only two losers
not dancing.

127
00:07:41,452 --> 00:07:44,019
Mm. If you can
call that dancing.

128
00:07:44,021 --> 00:07:45,957
Definitely not.

129
00:07:50,127 --> 00:07:52,361
Is that for your
YouTube channel?

130
00:07:52,363 --> 00:07:54,096
No. No.

131
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:56,097
YouTube's for
my volunteer stuff,

132
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:58,234
and Snapchats are just for fun.

133
00:07:58,236 --> 00:08:00,402
Um, I'm gonna go
to the señoritas'.

134
00:08:00,404 --> 00:08:03,037
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

135
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,039
Come on, come on.

136
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,476
Hey, I thought you were
done with this shit.

137
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:10,145
- You're moving in with Lucas, to D.C., remember?
- Yeah. Yeah.

138
00:08:10,147 --> 00:08:13,315
- What... what are you doing?
- I'm-I'm sorry.

139
00:08:13,317 --> 00:08:15,250
I'm so stupid. I'm just...

140
00:08:15,252 --> 00:08:17,519
I'm just drunk, okay?

141
00:08:17,521 --> 00:08:19,858
You're seriously
the best friend ever.

142
00:08:21,024 --> 00:08:22,157
Okay.

143
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:23,125
- You're good?
- Yeah.

144
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:27,462
Look who I found
trying and failing to salsa.

145
00:08:27,464 --> 00:08:28,664
Cool.

146
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,465
- I wasn't that bad.
- Hey.

147
00:08:30,467 --> 00:08:31,600
- Hey.
- I missed you.

148
00:08:31,602 --> 00:08:33,534
- I missed you.
- Welcome back.

149
00:08:33,536 --> 00:08:34,770
I missed you, too.

150
00:08:34,772 --> 00:08:36,572
So you weren't doing
too well with the salsa, huh?

151
00:08:43,613 --> 00:08:47,149
- Olivia! What?
- Ronnie?

152
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,250
Hi. What are you doing here?

153
00:08:49,252 --> 00:08:51,419
Oh, I'm just skiing. What
do you think I'm doing here?

154
00:08:51,421 --> 00:08:54,289
I'm getting my spring break on.
Do you want to join me?

155
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,158
No. Thanks.

156
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,159
Hey, where's Markie?
Maybe we could do, like,

157
00:08:58,161 --> 00:09:00,228
- you know, a little ménage à trois?
- You know what?

158
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,996
She's actually
with her boyfriend, Lucas.

159
00:09:01,998 --> 00:09:03,531
What about, like,
a ménage à dos?

160
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:06,003
Not happening, pal.

161
00:09:07,504 --> 00:09:10,039
Oh, yeah?
Is there a problem, pal?

162
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:12,274
No.

163
00:09:12,276 --> 00:09:14,543
I'm just surprised she hasn't
punched you in the face yet.

164
00:09:14,545 --> 00:09:16,946
- Guess she's nicer than I am.
- Oh, yeah?

165
00:09:16,948 --> 00:09:18,579
How about I punch you
in the face? Huh?

166
00:09:18,581 --> 00:09:19,615
Wouldn't be the worst thing

167
00:09:19,617 --> 00:09:20,949
that's happened to me
this week.

168
00:09:20,951 --> 00:09:21,983
Okay, Ronnie, calm down.

169
00:09:21,985 --> 00:09:24,319
Seriously, you got to
let it go.

170
00:09:24,321 --> 00:09:27,021
All right? I saw Delta Phi in
the back. They're doing shots.

171
00:09:27,023 --> 00:09:29,193
So you should
really go check it out.

172
00:09:31,094 --> 00:09:33,227
I can't say no to shots.
Everyone knows that.

173
00:09:33,229 --> 00:09:35,499
That's why I'm gonna leave,
not 'cause of what you said.

174
00:09:41,973 --> 00:09:43,639
You think I'm too nice?

175
00:09:43,641 --> 00:09:45,207
It's a good thing.

176
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,208
Except when dealing
with guys at bars, so...

177
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,178
Feel free to tell me
to piss off.

178
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:52,117
Maybe I just like being nice.

179
00:09:54,017 --> 00:09:56,050
Can I give it a shot?

180
00:09:58,421 --> 00:10:00,356
- I'm Carter.
- Olivia.

181
00:10:00,358 --> 00:10:01,756
Buy you a drink?

182
00:10:01,758 --> 00:10:03,358
Yeah.

183
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,994
Another beer,

184
00:10:04,996 --> 00:10:08,130
and... a margarita
for the lady.

185
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,035
Come on!

186
00:10:14,037 --> 00:10:15,571
There's got to be an all-night
bar around here somewhere.

187
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,573
We still have that tequila
back in the room.

188
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,673
But it's our last night
in Mexico.

189
00:10:18,675 --> 00:10:20,742
I don't want
to go back to the room.

190
00:10:20,744 --> 00:10:22,711
I know a place we can go.

191
00:10:22,713 --> 00:10:26,180
I'm... I'm sorry, who are you?

192
00:10:26,182 --> 00:10:29,451
- Uh, it's a bit of a hike, but it's worth it.
- Hmm.

193
00:10:29,453 --> 00:10:32,187
Or you can just tell me
to piss off.

194
00:10:32,189 --> 00:10:33,654
I think, uh...

195
00:10:33,656 --> 00:10:36,091
think the hotel room
sounds pretty good, yeah.

196
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:38,530
- Yeah.
- Oh, come on, it's our final spring break.

197
00:10:40,397 --> 00:10:44,566
Before life tears us apart.

198
00:10:44,568 --> 00:10:46,404
Right.

199
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,576
We're almost there.

200
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,311
I should have worn
my hiking shoes.

201
00:10:56,313 --> 00:10:57,645
Um... okay.

202
00:10:57,647 --> 00:10:59,615
Should I lay down
some bread crumbs?

203
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,019
Wait, guys, be careful.

204
00:11:02,652 --> 00:11:05,289
Wonder what that means.
How's your Spanish, Brad? Ow.

205
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:11,428
Come on, guys, let's go.

206
00:11:18,701 --> 00:11:21,636
Wow. This place is interesting.

207
00:11:23,206 --> 00:11:25,106
- Kind of terrifying.
- Uh...

208
00:11:25,108 --> 00:11:26,741
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

209
00:11:26,743 --> 00:11:28,309
Promise.

210
00:11:28,311 --> 00:11:30,578
Uh, yeah, this is
way better than a club.

211
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,713
Hey. You okay?

212
00:11:32,715 --> 00:11:35,116
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

213
00:11:35,118 --> 00:11:38,287
- Just a little tired.
- Yeah. We won't stay long.

214
00:11:38,289 --> 00:11:40,492
Where's the tequila?

215
00:11:44,094 --> 00:11:46,260
Hope you've had
your tetanus shot.

216
00:11:46,262 --> 00:11:48,130
I got to piss.

217
00:11:52,335 --> 00:11:54,705
- Nice. Thank you.
- Cool, cool. Thanks, man.

218
00:12:35,345 --> 00:12:38,347
Oh!

219
00:12:38,349 --> 00:12:39,783
Ugh.

220
00:12:53,497 --> 00:12:56,198
Oh! Yo! Chill out, O-dog, it's just me.

221
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,500
Ronnie, did you follow me here?

222
00:12:58,502 --> 00:13:00,736
You can't keep Ron-Ron
from a party.

223
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:05,506
What the hell?

224
00:13:05,508 --> 00:13:07,544
This smells horrible.
What is... what...

225
00:13:15,853 --> 00:13:17,752
Yo, beer me, bro.

226
00:13:17,754 --> 00:13:20,588
Oh, great, Ronnie's here.

227
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,823
Sure thing, bro.

228
00:13:22,825 --> 00:13:25,327
Um, you know, we got to

229
00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:27,261
- get up early, so...
- Yeah. - Yeah. - Yes.

230
00:13:27,263 --> 00:13:29,798
- Yeah, yeah.
- You guys just got here.

231
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,733
- You can't leave now.
- Yeah. What's the rush?

232
00:13:32,735 --> 00:13:34,702
Um...

233
00:13:34,704 --> 00:13:36,538
Yeah, let's, uh, let's play
a game or something.

234
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,506
Oh, yeah, like spin the bottle.

235
00:13:38,508 --> 00:13:41,610
- And on that note, let's, uh...
- I was thinking Truth or Dare.

236
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:44,746
What, this a seventh grade
sleepover, or...?

237
00:13:44,748 --> 00:13:47,783
I know it's a kids' game, but,
I mean, if you play it right,

238
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,952
it's a chance to expose
your friends' deepest secrets,

239
00:13:50,954 --> 00:13:54,325
and... make them do
things they don't want to.

240
00:13:55,993 --> 00:13:58,327
That actually does sound
kind of interesting.

241
00:13:58,329 --> 00:13:59,995
Uh...

242
00:13:59,997 --> 00:14:01,597
Great. We're in.

243
00:14:01,599 --> 00:14:02,898
Okay, everybody, get behind me.

244
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,667
- And... one, two, three.
- Smile. - <i>Queso.</i>

245
00:14:05,669 --> 00:14:08,937
Yo, will you tag me in that? Your boy.

246
00:14:08,939 --> 00:14:11,005
Glad you're with us, Ronnie.

247
00:14:14,612 --> 00:14:16,912
Well?

248
00:14:16,914 --> 00:14:18,614
Olivia, truth or dare?

249
00:14:18,616 --> 00:14:20,749
- Whoo!
- Hmm.

250
00:14:20,751 --> 00:14:22,918
- Truth.
- Lame.

251
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,487
Um... aliens.

252
00:14:26,489 --> 00:14:28,457
They land right now
and they give you a choice.

253
00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:31,360
They kill everyone
in this room,

254
00:14:31,362 --> 00:14:33,629
and then leave
peacefully, or...

255
00:14:33,631 --> 00:14:36,731
they kill the entire
population of Mexico,

256
00:14:36,733 --> 00:14:39,268
but we escape unscathed.

257
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,702
Choose.

258
00:14:40,704 --> 00:14:42,504
What kind of ridiculous
question is that?

259
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:45,274
- It's a moral dilemma.
- I don't have morals.

260
00:14:45,276 --> 00:14:46,842
- Of course you don't.
- Okay, well, obviously,

261
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,443
- she's choosing us.
- Sorry, guys.

262
00:14:49,445 --> 00:14:52,547
- What?
- You're gonna let aliens kill us?

263
00:14:52,549 --> 00:14:54,683
I love you, but millions
of people? Come on.

264
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,550
You have to tell the truth.

265
00:14:56,552 --> 00:14:58,986
- I am. It's the only right answer.
- Eh, whatever.

266
00:14:58,988 --> 00:15:01,689
Well, I'm bored
of this already,

267
00:15:01,691 --> 00:15:03,592
so let's get
this party started.

268
00:15:03,594 --> 00:15:05,494
- You brought us here.
- Ooh.

269
00:15:05,496 --> 00:15:07,696
Yo, I know how to amp this up
a little bit.

270
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,965
- Why don't we get, like, a little girl-on-girl going?
- No.

271
00:15:09,967 --> 00:15:12,067
- Ronnie. Truth or dare?
- I'd watch that.

272
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:13,802
Dare. Duh.

273
00:15:13,804 --> 00:15:16,737
I dare you to give Tyson
a lap dance for 30 seconds.

274
00:15:16,739 --> 00:15:18,640
- No way. No. I won't do it.
- Yes. - Yep.

275
00:15:18,642 --> 00:15:20,775
Once you're asked, you're in.
That's the rules.

276
00:15:20,777 --> 00:15:22,977
No, there's, like, three chicks
here. You couldn't dare...?

277
00:15:22,979 --> 00:15:24,779
- Come on. - Ronnie.
- Yo, this sucks.

278
00:15:24,781 --> 00:15:25,947
- Get over here.
- So wack!

279
00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:27,816
- There you go.
- Get it.

280
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:29,951
- Yo, no tips, no touching, bro.
- Just do it.

281
00:15:29,953 --> 00:15:31,653
- Don't make this a thing.
- Hold this.

282
00:15:31,655 --> 00:15:33,454
- Don't make this weird.
- This is gonna be the longest

283
00:15:33,456 --> 00:15:34,823
30 seconds of my life.
Let's go. Come on.

284
00:15:34,825 --> 00:15:36,558
- Take it off!
- All right!

285
00:15:37,927 --> 00:15:39,026
- Oh, my God!
- Oh! Oh!

286
00:15:39,028 --> 00:15:40,495
He's done this before.

287
00:15:40,497 --> 00:15:41,962
Ooh, I think
he kind of likes this.

288
00:15:41,964 --> 00:15:43,365
We got a real pro here.

289
00:15:43,367 --> 00:15:44,598
Look at that technique.

290
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,000
Ronnie!

291
00:15:46,002 --> 00:15:47,068
- Ronnie! Ronnie!
- He's done this before.

292
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,537
Look at that.

293
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:50,105
- Make it rain pesos!
- I don't want your pesos!

294
00:15:50,107 --> 00:15:52,808
Aw. Cheer up.

295
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,077
- Weird.
- Okay.

296
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,849
All right, Lucas,
truth or dare?

297
00:16:10,426 --> 00:16:12,394
Okay, who's ready?

298
00:16:13,796 --> 00:16:16,530
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yeah!

299
00:16:18,735 --> 00:16:22,471
Okay, guys, I promise you, it's
just because it's cold in here.

300
00:16:22,473 --> 00:16:24,372
- I have no judgment.
- Scarred for life.

301
00:16:24,374 --> 00:16:26,040
Hold your applause, please.

302
00:16:26,042 --> 00:16:27,576
Thank you.

303
00:16:27,578 --> 00:16:28,876
Quite the show.

304
00:16:28,878 --> 00:16:30,712
Thank you.

305
00:16:30,714 --> 00:16:33,448
Okay, Markie's turn.

306
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,516
I got this one.
Truth or dare?

307
00:16:35,518 --> 00:16:37,519
Uh, truth.

308
00:16:37,521 --> 00:16:41,492
Are you aware that Olivia
is in love with your boyfriend?

309
00:16:45,728 --> 00:16:48,063
- No, she's not.
- Come on, it's so obvious.

310
00:16:48,065 --> 00:16:51,066
- Will you stop being such an asshole?
- Just being truthful.

311
00:16:51,068 --> 00:16:52,701
- Hey, Tyson, shut up!
- Don't tell me to shut up.

312
00:16:52,703 --> 00:16:55,002
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Dude, we're all here

313
00:16:55,004 --> 00:16:56,571
because she's trying to make
you jealous, like, clearly.

314
00:16:56,573 --> 00:16:59,106
Why are you always
starting shit, dude?!

315
00:16:59,108 --> 00:17:01,042
- Somebody tell the truth, that would be great.
- Just stop it

316
00:17:01,044 --> 00:17:03,678
with the agro-posturing and
just get to my turn, please.

317
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,480
- Brad, truth or dare?
- Yes. Truth.

318
00:17:06,482 --> 00:17:09,751
If you had to make out with
anyone here, who would it be?

319
00:17:09,753 --> 00:17:12,423
It's okay if you're bi-curious.

320
00:17:22,732 --> 00:17:25,600
Scruffy boy over there.

321
00:17:25,602 --> 00:17:28,669
- Come on!
- I'm flattered.

322
00:17:28,671 --> 00:17:30,871
Tyson. Truth or dare?

323
00:17:30,873 --> 00:17:32,440
- Dare.
- I dare you to stop

324
00:17:32,442 --> 00:17:33,874
selling forged prescriptions
to freshmen.

325
00:17:33,876 --> 00:17:36,044
- Oh, shit.
- Olivia.

326
00:17:36,046 --> 00:17:37,813
Always with
the moral high ground.

327
00:17:37,815 --> 00:17:40,782
Fine. I make more money
off upperclassmen anyway.

328
00:17:40,784 --> 00:17:42,217
Oh, my God.

329
00:17:42,219 --> 00:17:44,785
Uh, Penelope. Truth or dare?

330
00:17:44,787 --> 00:17:46,521
- Dare.
- Make out with Olivia.

331
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:49,224
- Ronnie!
- Why not? Just try... It c-could be fun.

332
00:17:49,226 --> 00:17:51,062
- Just...
- Didn't see that one coming.

333
00:17:52,763 --> 00:17:55,130
It's okay, Liv,
just close your eyes

334
00:17:55,132 --> 00:17:57,834
- and pretend it's Lucas.
- You know what?

335
00:18:01,805 --> 00:18:04,573
Wow. Maybe I'm bi-curious.

336
00:18:04,575 --> 00:18:05,940
Tight.

337
00:18:05,942 --> 00:18:07,842
It's tight.

338
00:18:07,844 --> 00:18:10,512
Carter. You're up.

339
00:18:10,514 --> 00:18:12,714
Truth or dare?

340
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,149
Uh, truth.

341
00:18:14,151 --> 00:18:17,154
What are your intentions
with our sweet Olivia?

342
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,160
I needed to find
someone with friends

343
00:18:26,162 --> 00:18:28,665
that I could trick
into coming here.

344
00:18:31,634 --> 00:18:34,101
I could tell Olivia
was a pushover,

345
00:18:34,103 --> 00:18:36,039
which made her an easy target.

346
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:43,044
I brought you all up here
to play this game

347
00:18:43,046 --> 00:18:46,781
because...

348
00:18:46,783 --> 00:18:51,285
I'm okay with strangers dying
if it means I get to live.

349
00:18:51,287 --> 00:18:53,655
Uh...

350
00:18:53,657 --> 00:18:56,127
I'm sorry, but you should've
told me to piss off.

351
00:19:00,697 --> 00:19:03,098
Wait, what's up?

352
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,699
What the hell?

353
00:19:05,701 --> 00:19:09,103
Look, I know, it sounds insane,
but the game is real.

354
00:19:09,105 --> 00:19:09,971
Once you're asked, you're in.

355
00:19:09,973 --> 00:19:12,040
Okay? Wherever you go,
whatever you do,

356
00:19:12,042 --> 00:19:13,774
it'll find you.
Hey, don't, don't.

357
00:19:13,776 --> 00:19:17,178
Tell the truth or you die.
Do the dare or you die.

358
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,716
Refuse to play and...

359
00:19:20,616 --> 00:19:24,084
Just... just-just
follow the rules.

360
00:19:39,702 --> 00:19:41,638
Guys?

361
00:19:43,306 --> 00:19:45,075
Guys?

362
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,821
You okay?

363
00:19:58,921 --> 00:20:00,956
Yeah.

364
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,893
Yeah, I'm fine.

365
00:20:05,228 --> 00:20:07,629
Guy's a jerk.

366
00:20:07,631 --> 00:20:09,898
Want to get out of here?

367
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,003
Yeah. Great way
to end the trip, Liv.

368
00:20:14,103 --> 00:20:17,339
Yeah, I didn't like
that guy anyways.

369
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,210
Come on, we can go sleep in.

370
00:20:27,718 --> 00:20:29,217
Hey, man, see you in class.

371
00:20:29,219 --> 00:20:31,820
Coffee later.

372
00:20:33,256 --> 00:20:35,290
Make sure you make it
home next weekend, son.

373
00:20:35,292 --> 00:20:36,928
Gotcha.

374
00:20:38,728 --> 00:20:40,695
Hi.

375
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,296
Hey.

376
00:20:42,298 --> 00:20:44,299
All good with Officer Dad?

377
00:20:44,301 --> 00:20:45,967
Oh, absolutely.

378
00:20:45,969 --> 00:20:48,136
Now that he thinks
I spent my last week

379
00:20:48,138 --> 00:20:50,839
belly-bumping my nonexistent
girlfriend in wine country.

380
00:20:50,841 --> 00:20:53,675
Well, your Canadian lady, she
really does like a good Merlot.

381
00:20:53,677 --> 00:20:55,142
Uh, her name is Kimberly,

382
00:20:55,144 --> 00:20:57,678
- and her palate is quite refined, thank you.
- Oh.

383
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,114
Sorry. My apologies
to Canadian Kim.

384
00:21:00,116 --> 00:21:03,051
Remind why I didn't go to
school thousands of miles away

385
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,053
from my overbearing
and homophobic father.

386
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,721
- Because you never say no to him.
- Hmm.

387
00:21:07,723 --> 00:21:09,990
And you never would've met me.

388
00:21:09,992 --> 00:21:12,427
Are you sure you don't
want to be my beard?

389
00:21:12,429 --> 00:21:14,763
'Cause I really want to ghost Kimberly.

390
00:21:14,765 --> 00:21:17,198
Yeah, I doubt that would solve
either of our problems.

391
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,801
- How is Markie?
- I don't know.

392
00:21:19,803 --> 00:21:22,736
Haven't talked to her much
since we've been back.

393
00:21:22,738 --> 00:21:25,372
Don't worry about us.
We're friends for life.

394
00:21:25,374 --> 00:21:27,811
- Bye.
- See ya.

395
00:21:31,414 --> 00:21:34,218
- Hi, Olivia.
- Hey.

396
00:22:03,246 --> 00:22:05,815
- Here you go.
- God bless you.

397
00:22:08,751 --> 00:22:10,951
Hey. We made mojitos!

398
00:22:10,953 --> 00:22:12,387
Study party?

399
00:22:12,389 --> 00:22:14,456
- Yeah, maybe later.
- Oh, okay.

400
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,890
Olivia,

401
00:22:15,892 --> 00:22:17,958
um, Pen was saying that I was

402
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,428
a bit of dick in Mexico, so...
here's a little something

403
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:25,166
- to make it up to you.
- A prescription?

404
00:22:25,168 --> 00:22:28,436
- What? You're not a freshman.
- Yeah, you're not a doctor.

405
00:22:28,438 --> 00:22:31,941
That's... not
what my lucky pen says.

406
00:22:34,745 --> 00:22:36,745
I thought I was your lucky Pen.

407
00:22:36,747 --> 00:22:39,781
Oh, baby, but you are
my lucky Penelope.

408
00:22:39,783 --> 00:22:42,917
- Oh, my lucky Pen! Oh! Oh!
- Tyson! Tyson!

409
00:23:32,969 --> 00:23:36,804
Roy Cameron, 45 years old,
attempts to make dinner.

410
00:23:36,806 --> 00:23:38,238
Take one.

411
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,140
A little faith, please.

412
00:23:40,142 --> 00:23:42,442
Nobody makes a steak
like your old man.

413
00:23:42,444 --> 00:23:45,179
Uh, Dad, I'm pescatarian now.

414
00:23:45,181 --> 00:23:48,515
Right. And that's
why I meant to say...

415
00:23:48,517 --> 00:23:52,419
swordfish steaks! Boom!

416
00:23:52,421 --> 00:23:56,024
- God, you are such a dork.
- But you still love me, right?

417
00:23:56,026 --> 00:23:58,359
Yeah, yeah, I still love you.

418
00:23:58,361 --> 00:24:00,061
Good.

419
00:24:20,283 --> 00:24:22,082
- Sorry.
- Hi.

420
00:24:22,084 --> 00:24:23,551
Come bearing gifts.

421
00:24:23,553 --> 00:24:25,386
Penelope said
you didn't want one.

422
00:24:25,388 --> 00:24:27,221
I know you better than that.

423
00:24:27,223 --> 00:24:29,357
Yeah, you're right.
Probably could use a drink.

424
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:32,360
So, I know things have been...

425
00:24:32,362 --> 00:24:34,896
a little Bette and Joan
between us

426
00:24:34,898 --> 00:24:38,198
since Mexico, but...
awkwardness stops here.

427
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,567
Okay? And since my dad
took his life,

428
00:24:40,569 --> 00:24:43,338
y-you've been my only family.

429
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:46,006
The one person
I can really trust.

430
00:24:46,008 --> 00:24:48,275
So I'm not gonna let
a stupid comment by Tyson,

431
00:24:48,277 --> 00:24:50,511
of all people, change that.

432
00:24:50,513 --> 00:24:53,982
Markie, I promise you,

433
00:24:53,984 --> 00:24:57,150
I do not have feelings
for your boyfriend.

434
00:24:57,152 --> 00:25:01,054
He's like a brother
to me, okay?

435
00:25:01,056 --> 00:25:03,190
Okay. Yeah.

436
00:25:03,192 --> 00:25:05,528
Between you and the world,
I choose you.

437
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:08,999
And I choose you.

438
00:25:10,499 --> 00:25:12,499
Mm. Oh, my gosh.

439
00:25:12,501 --> 00:25:14,067
- That is...
- Wow.

440
00:25:14,069 --> 00:25:15,503
- ...very strong.
- Yeah.

441
00:25:25,547 --> 00:25:27,215
Think about
your mom, and, like,

442
00:25:27,217 --> 00:25:29,082
it just happens sometimes...

443
00:25:29,084 --> 00:25:31,052
Hey, asshole.

444
00:25:31,054 --> 00:25:33,053
Do you think that's funny?

445
00:25:33,055 --> 00:25:34,458
Think what's funny?

446
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:38,359
I-I don't get it.

447
00:25:38,361 --> 00:25:40,194
My desk and the flyer
were harmless,

448
00:25:40,196 --> 00:25:42,663
but it's gonna cost me
a lot of money to fix my car.

449
00:25:42,665 --> 00:25:45,365
Okay, I am so lost right now.
What are you talking about?

450
00:25:45,367 --> 00:25:47,567
You keyed "truth or dare"
into my car door.

451
00:25:47,569 --> 00:25:49,637
There's nothing on your car.

452
00:25:49,639 --> 00:25:51,505
Except your idea
of a lame joke.

453
00:25:51,507 --> 00:25:53,408
Okay, you're a little crazy.
But you know what?

454
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:54,976
I actually happen
to like crazy.

455
00:25:54,978 --> 00:25:56,311
Do you want to maybe
get a drink sometime?

456
00:25:56,313 --> 00:25:58,513
Will you just
leave me alone? Okay?

457
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,450
Is that a no?

458
00:26:04,386 --> 00:26:06,387
Hey, Sarah,
have you seen Markie?

459
00:26:06,389 --> 00:26:08,325
In the library.

460
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:16,997
Hey, Olivia.

461
00:26:16,999 --> 00:26:19,132
Truth or dare?

462
00:26:19,134 --> 00:26:20,968
What did you say?

463
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,506
Truth or dare?

464
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:30,644
Truth or dare?
Truth or dare?

465
00:26:30,646 --> 00:26:32,647
Truth or dare? Truth or dare?

466
00:26:32,649 --> 00:26:34,415
Truth or dare?

467
00:26:34,417 --> 00:26:36,351
Truth or dare? Truth or dare?

468
00:26:36,353 --> 00:26:39,187
Truth or dare?
Truth or dare?

469
00:26:39,189 --> 00:26:41,488
- Truth or dare? Truth or dare?
- Truth! Stop!

470
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:43,457
What secret does
your best friend make you hide?

471
00:26:43,459 --> 00:26:45,595
Markie's constantly
cheating on Lucas!

472
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:57,271
That true?

473
00:26:57,273 --> 00:26:59,076
Markie...

474
00:27:01,478 --> 00:27:03,413
Luke.

475
00:27:05,481 --> 00:27:07,381
Lucas.

476
00:27:07,383 --> 00:27:10,584
- Wait.
- Markie, I don't know what's going on.

477
00:27:10,586 --> 00:27:12,152
He's like a brother to you?

478
00:27:12,154 --> 00:27:14,389
No, I'm serious.
I'm seeing things.

479
00:27:14,391 --> 00:27:17,127
Touch me again,
and I'll break that hand.

480
00:27:37,046 --> 00:27:39,679
- That's insane.
- Seriously.

481
00:27:39,681 --> 00:27:42,550
Yo. 'Sup?
You want to play?

482
00:27:42,552 --> 00:27:44,317
You look like a girl
who's good with balls.

483
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:47,455
Please do not talk to me.

484
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,122
No, look, uh, just one game.

485
00:27:49,124 --> 00:27:51,191
- Like, I just want to show you my pool cue.
- Okay.

486
00:27:51,193 --> 00:27:52,692
And by "pool cue,"
I mean penis.

487
00:27:52,694 --> 00:27:54,428
I'm referring to my penis.
Maybe we could have sex.

488
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,299
You know, see what happens.

489
00:27:59,134 --> 00:28:01,270
Truth or dare, Ronnie?

490
00:28:03,073 --> 00:28:05,073
What, did Olivia
put you up to this?

491
00:28:05,075 --> 00:28:08,342
Truth... or dare?

492
00:28:08,344 --> 00:28:11,611
Uh, creepy... and sexy.

493
00:28:11,613 --> 00:28:13,680
Let's do it. Dare.

494
00:28:13,682 --> 00:28:16,817
Get on the table and
show everyone your pool cue.

495
00:28:16,819 --> 00:28:19,789
I knew it. Okay. All right.

496
00:28:22,225 --> 00:28:25,293
Hello, friends and neighbors!

497
00:28:25,295 --> 00:28:26,828
This fine young lady here
has asked me

498
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,496
to play a little game
of Truth or Dare with her,

499
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:31,299
and like a real gentleman,
I chose dare!

500
00:28:31,301 --> 00:28:33,333
- Go, Ronnie!
- Whoo!

501
00:28:33,335 --> 00:28:35,469
Anyway, now I will
do you all the honor

502
00:28:35,471 --> 00:28:38,339
of showing you my business.

503
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:40,507
Seen it before! Not impressed!

504
00:28:40,509 --> 00:28:42,810
Oh!

505
00:28:42,812 --> 00:28:45,545
- Who is that, Beth?
- No, but Beth said it was tiny, too.

506
00:28:46,815 --> 00:28:48,815
No, uh, Beth would
never say that!

507
00:28:48,817 --> 00:28:50,751
Okay, you know what,
screw this, I'm not...

508
00:28:50,753 --> 00:28:52,089
- Oh, man.
- Oh, my.

509
00:29:04,167 --> 00:29:06,467
Whoa, careful! Dude.
Hey, watch the pool cue, man.

510
00:29:06,469 --> 00:29:07,869
Thank you.

511
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,540
- Yeah.
- Whoa.

512
00:29:17,514 --> 00:29:19,880
Somebody call 911!

513
00:29:19,882 --> 00:29:22,917
<i>I swear to you,
people were talking to me.</i>

514
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:24,752
<i>It looked like
a messed-up Snapchat filter.</i>

515
00:29:24,754 --> 00:29:26,219
<i>They were asking me</i>

516
00:29:26,221 --> 00:29:28,488
"truth or dare"
over and over again,

517
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:31,225
and... I-I panicked.

518
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:33,226
So you're saying
a mob of people

519
00:29:33,228 --> 00:29:35,228
chanting in unison
made you tell Lucas

520
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:36,863
that Markie is
a cheating whore.

521
00:29:36,865 --> 00:29:38,565
Look, I know it sounds insane.

522
00:29:38,567 --> 00:29:40,767
- Just a little.
- But it happened.

523
00:29:40,769 --> 00:29:42,503
Something really weird

524
00:29:42,505 --> 00:29:44,272
has been going on
ever since Mexico.

525
00:29:44,274 --> 00:29:45,939
Oh, come on.

526
00:29:45,941 --> 00:29:49,209
Uh, keeping a secret like that,
it's a huge burden.

527
00:29:49,211 --> 00:29:50,477
None of us would fault you

528
00:29:50,479 --> 00:29:52,345
for trying
to get it off your chest.

529
00:29:52,347 --> 00:29:54,614
I mean,
n-not maybe so publicly.

530
00:29:54,616 --> 00:29:57,618
I wish you would have done it
for your YouTube channel.

531
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,920
- I will stab you with this.
- Calm down, baby.

532
00:30:01,958 --> 00:30:03,823
Basic Beth again.

533
00:30:08,597 --> 00:30:10,331
Holy shit.

534
00:30:13,236 --> 00:30:15,669
Excuse me,

535
00:30:15,671 --> 00:30:17,371
friends and neighbors!

536
00:30:17,373 --> 00:30:19,473
This fine young lady
right here has asked me

537
00:30:19,475 --> 00:30:21,708
to play a game
of Truth or Dare with her,

538
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:24,678
- and like a real gentleman, I chose dare.
- Go, Ronnie!

539
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,380
Anyway, now I will
do you all the honor

540
00:30:27,382 --> 00:30:29,417
of showing you my business.

541
00:30:29,419 --> 00:30:31,588
- Gross.
- Ugh.

542
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,293
Call 911!

543
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:41,861
Bad break.

544
00:30:41,863 --> 00:30:44,634
- It's a pool joke.
- That's not funny.

545
00:30:46,568 --> 00:30:49,603
- It's the game.
- What?

546
00:30:49,605 --> 00:30:51,805
- It is. It followed us home.
- Are-are you being serious?

547
00:30:51,807 --> 00:30:53,841
Carter told me
that it was real,

548
00:30:53,843 --> 00:30:55,610
that we were all in,
and that it would find us.

549
00:30:55,612 --> 00:30:56,944
We're really taking the word

550
00:30:56,946 --> 00:30:58,778
of our mentally unstable
tour guide?

551
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:01,248
How else do you explain what
happened to me in the library?

552
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,251
- Huh? And now Ronnie?
- Oh, I don't know.

553
00:31:03,253 --> 00:31:04,919
Maybe he was drunk
and he fell off a pool table,

554
00:31:04,921 --> 00:31:06,621
- which is what happened.
- So, it's just a coincidence that

555
00:31:06,623 --> 00:31:08,688
- he was supposed to be doing a dare?
- Let's just calm down.

556
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:11,292
- Yes.
- No. Carter said, "Tell the truth or you die.

557
00:31:11,294 --> 00:31:13,828
Do the dare or you die."
Ronnie chickened out.

558
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,963
He did not do his dare,
and now he's dead!

559
00:31:15,965 --> 00:31:19,300
Guys, tell me I'm not crazy!

560
00:31:19,302 --> 00:31:21,669
Oh, no,
you definitely sound crazy.

561
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,504
Lucas.

562
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:25,505
I am so sorry

563
00:31:25,507 --> 00:31:27,475
for what I said,
but I swear to you,

564
00:31:27,477 --> 00:31:29,476
something forced me
to say that.

565
00:31:29,478 --> 00:31:32,280
And I need you to believe me.

566
00:31:32,282 --> 00:31:34,482
Please.

567
00:31:34,484 --> 00:31:36,516
Kind of hard
to believe someone

568
00:31:36,518 --> 00:31:38,622
who's been lying to you
for so long.

569
00:31:44,727 --> 00:31:46,662
See you, guys.

570
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,400
Anyway,
now I will do you all the honor

571
00:31:53,402 --> 00:31:55,338
of showing you my business.

572
00:32:02,511 --> 00:32:04,512
Lucas.

573
00:32:23,966 --> 00:32:26,436
Lucas.

574
00:32:56,132 --> 00:32:58,698
Lucas.

575
00:33:04,006 --> 00:33:06,310
That's very funny, guys.

576
00:33:11,546 --> 00:33:13,848
Okay, this is insane.

577
00:33:39,007 --> 00:33:40,844
Hey.

578
00:33:41,943 --> 00:33:43,878
I believe you.

579
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,913
Something started burning
"truth or dare" into my arm.

580
00:33:46,915 --> 00:33:49,483
- Oh, my God, are you okay?
- Y-Yeah.

581
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,785
Yeah, I mean...
it's gone now.

582
00:33:51,787 --> 00:33:54,188
But... I felt it.

583
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:56,724
Olivia, it was really painful.

584
00:33:56,726 --> 00:33:58,691
Yeah, and when I was
in the library,

585
00:33:58,693 --> 00:34:01,861
I was surrounded by people, but
what we're seeing is not real.

586
00:34:01,863 --> 00:34:03,799
Only the consequences are.

587
00:34:05,867 --> 00:34:07,902
Did you answer?

588
00:34:07,904 --> 00:34:10,841
Lucas, you have to answer.

589
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:16,546
I've had feelings for Olivia
since we met.

590
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,185
Sometimes I wonder
what it would be like

591
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:28,121
to be with her
instead of Markie.

592
00:34:28,123 --> 00:34:31,826
And I wonder what it would be
like to wake up next to her...

593
00:34:31,828 --> 00:34:34,828
and kiss her.

594
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:37,698
But I know
that can never happen.

595
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,603
Oh, God, please tell me
you didn't hang up.

596
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,873
We have to convince
everybody else.

597
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:48,812
I'm coming.

598
00:34:55,984 --> 00:34:58,752
What is all this?

599
00:34:58,754 --> 00:35:01,120
An intervention?

600
00:35:01,122 --> 00:35:03,223
I always thought day-drinking
Penelope would be first.

601
00:35:03,225 --> 00:35:04,525
Thanks.

602
00:35:04,527 --> 00:35:05,960
Thank you for coming.

603
00:35:05,962 --> 00:35:08,895
I live here.

604
00:35:08,897 --> 00:35:11,498
So, what is it all about?

605
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,234
The game.

606
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:15,935
We're still playing it in the
same order we played in Mexico.

607
00:35:15,937 --> 00:35:18,004
Carter told us the truth;
the game is real.

608
00:35:18,006 --> 00:35:20,674
First, it was my turn,
I got asked in the library, and

609
00:35:20,676 --> 00:35:22,542
it made me tell your secret;
then it was Ronnie's turn,

610
00:35:22,544 --> 00:35:23,944
he didn't do his dare,
and it killed him.

611
00:35:23,946 --> 00:35:25,712
Maybe you and Ronnie
shouldn't have answered.

612
00:35:25,714 --> 00:35:28,082
Carter also said,
"Refuse to play and you die."

613
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,620
I got asked tonight,
and I tried to ignore it.

614
00:35:32,721 --> 00:35:34,721
But then something burned
"truth or dare" on my arm.

615
00:35:34,723 --> 00:35:37,891
Show me.

616
00:35:37,893 --> 00:35:39,759
I mean, it's gone now, but...

617
00:35:39,761 --> 00:35:42,830
- Th-There's nothing there.
- Because I told the truth.

618
00:35:42,832 --> 00:35:46,100
- Oh, my God. Geez.
- Wow. Olivia.

619
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:47,902
I mean, this is next-level.

620
00:35:47,904 --> 00:35:50,737
You can't take responsibility
for humiliating me

621
00:35:50,739 --> 00:35:52,906
in front of everyone
and ruining my relationship,

622
00:35:52,908 --> 00:35:54,942
so you come up
with some insane story

623
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,911
that a game made you say it?

624
00:35:56,913 --> 00:35:59,746
Then you get Lucas
to lie for you.

625
00:35:59,748 --> 00:36:01,549
- No, I'm done.
- Markie.

626
00:36:01,551 --> 00:36:02,886
Markie. Stop.

627
00:36:04,219 --> 00:36:06,853
- You can't be alone.
- Why not?

628
00:36:06,855 --> 00:36:09,089
Because in the picture,
your turn is next.

629
00:36:14,763 --> 00:36:16,700
Unknown number.
Of course it is.

630
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,601
- "Truth or Dare?" Wow, a text. Really?
- Huh.

631
00:36:21,603 --> 00:36:22,870
I mean, there's no way a human

632
00:36:22,872 --> 00:36:24,904
- could have sent...
- Just answer it.

633
00:36:24,906 --> 00:36:26,774
Fine.

634
00:36:26,776 --> 00:36:28,775
Dare.

635
00:36:28,777 --> 00:36:31,245
"Dare you to follow through
with your promise.

636
00:36:31,247 --> 00:36:33,346
Break Olivia's hand."

637
00:36:33,348 --> 00:36:35,114
Obviously, this was you.

638
00:36:35,116 --> 00:36:37,250
Do you see me
texting you right now?

639
00:36:37,252 --> 00:36:40,120
No, but you were the only one
there when I said that.

640
00:36:40,122 --> 00:36:43,257
Markie, why would I dare you
to break my own hand?

641
00:36:43,259 --> 00:36:45,192
I don't know!
Okay, maybe you're making

642
00:36:45,194 --> 00:36:46,859
a new YouTube video
on how to lose friends.

643
00:36:46,861 --> 00:36:48,097
Oh, that seems
even less likely.

644
00:36:49,799 --> 00:36:52,065
- What are you doing?
- You have to do it.

645
00:36:52,067 --> 00:36:53,801
What?

646
00:36:53,803 --> 00:36:56,038
You have to.

647
00:36:57,973 --> 00:37:01,040
Ronnie didn't do his dare,
and now he's dead.

648
00:37:01,042 --> 00:37:03,743
- Liv, this is so messed up.
- Even by my standards.

649
00:37:03,745 --> 00:37:06,145
Look, as pissed as I am
at you right now...

650
00:37:06,147 --> 00:37:09,216
and I'm so pissed... there's no
way I'm gonna break your hand.

651
00:37:09,218 --> 00:37:11,118
Well, you don't really
have a choice.

652
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,821
So just take it. Please.

653
00:37:13,823 --> 00:37:17,027
Markie, I don't want to find
out what happens if you don't.

654
00:37:18,893 --> 00:37:20,863
Just do it.

655
00:37:29,739 --> 00:37:32,172
- No, I-I can't.
- God, just trust me, Markie!

656
00:37:32,174 --> 00:37:34,143
Do it. Please.

657
00:37:38,147 --> 00:37:40,683
Oh, don't tell me you're
a fucking coward like your dad.

658
00:37:44,687 --> 00:37:46,286
Oh, oh, my God.

659
00:37:46,288 --> 00:37:47,855
I'll get some ice.

660
00:37:47,857 --> 00:37:49,723
I can't deal
with this crazy right now.

661
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:51,158
I got a med school
interview tomorrow.

662
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,359
Uh, see a doctor.

663
00:37:52,361 --> 00:37:54,862
- I'm sorry. Sorry.
- Guys!

664
00:37:54,864 --> 00:37:58,065
Look, we got to go
to the hospital, okay? Come on.

665
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:05,274
<i>You believe all this?</i>

666
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:10,444
I don't know what to believe.

667
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:42,245
Come on.

668
00:39:27,756 --> 00:39:29,024
Brad.

669
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,328
Truth or dare?

670
00:39:40,102 --> 00:39:41,100
Brad.

671
00:39:41,102 --> 00:39:43,439
Truth!

672
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,817
Brad?

673
00:39:57,819 --> 00:39:59,853
Hi.

674
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:02,188
- What are you doing here?
- Uh, my job.

675
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:04,190
Why are you here?

676
00:40:04,192 --> 00:40:06,292
Friend of mine got hurt.
It's nothing serious.

677
00:40:06,294 --> 00:40:09,198
I'm just here for...
for moral support.

678
00:40:11,933 --> 00:40:14,467
Something wrong?

679
00:40:14,469 --> 00:40:19,138
Yeah, no, I'm just, uh...
I'm just a little shaken up.

680
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,841
You haven't come by to see
your mother in a few weeks.

681
00:40:21,843 --> 00:40:23,143
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

682
00:40:23,145 --> 00:40:24,944
I thought I was paying
for this school

683
00:40:24,946 --> 00:40:26,946
so you could come home
every once in a while.

684
00:40:26,948 --> 00:40:28,915
I-I know, I know, I just...

685
00:40:28,917 --> 00:40:31,185
Things have been
a little crazy lately.

686
00:40:31,187 --> 00:40:34,022
You know, I don't want
to hear excuses, son.

687
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:37,826
I want the truth.

688
00:40:40,428 --> 00:40:43,429
There goes another thousand
dollars in credit card debt.

689
00:40:43,431 --> 00:40:45,299
Oh, my God, Liv.

690
00:40:45,301 --> 00:40:47,301
I just had my turn.

691
00:40:47,303 --> 00:40:49,169
- You what?
- The game.

692
00:40:49,171 --> 00:40:52,239
It made me, um,
it made me come out.

693
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:55,442
To my father.

694
00:40:55,444 --> 00:40:57,781
Wha... Are you okay?

695
00:40:59,214 --> 00:41:00,913
Yeah.

696
00:41:00,915 --> 00:41:02,583
Yeah. Yeah.

697
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:05,953
For the first time in my life,
I... I told him my truth

698
00:41:05,955 --> 00:41:08,487
and I stood up to him,
and I feel...

699
00:41:08,489 --> 00:41:10,489
I feel awesome.

700
00:41:10,491 --> 00:41:14,127
Okay, hold on, your dad
didn't know that you were gay?

701
00:41:14,129 --> 00:41:16,362
Your ringtone's Beyoncé.

702
00:41:16,364 --> 00:41:18,098
Everyone loves Beyoncé.

703
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,036
Tyson's next.

704
00:41:36,218 --> 00:41:38,451
Will do.

705
00:41:38,453 --> 00:41:40,453
Tyson Curran?

706
00:41:40,455 --> 00:41:43,091
Let's do this.

707
00:41:46,895 --> 00:41:48,832
Right this way.

708
00:41:53,067 --> 00:41:56,036
So, you come from
a family of doctors, then?

709
00:41:56,038 --> 00:41:59,473
Yes, ma'am. Mother, father,
sister, uncle and grandfather.

710
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,007
Pretty much everybody.

711
00:42:01,009 --> 00:42:02,509
Well, they must have
set a great example

712
00:42:02,511 --> 00:42:04,411
for you to want
to take the same route.

713
00:42:04,413 --> 00:42:05,978
Yes, uh, absolutely,
Dean Spencer.

714
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:07,980
You know, uh, growing up,

715
00:42:07,982 --> 00:42:10,449
I would hear their stories
about saving lives,

716
00:42:10,451 --> 00:42:12,618
and... I think...

717
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:15,524
I think that somehow
shaped me.

718
00:42:19,194 --> 00:42:21,127
Pen. Where's Tyson?

719
00:42:21,129 --> 00:42:23,498
His med school interview. Why?

720
00:42:26,435 --> 00:42:29,002
You know...

721
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:31,404
I could do something...

722
00:42:31,406 --> 00:42:34,207
self-serving, like become
a hedge fund manager.

723
00:42:34,209 --> 00:42:38,210
The thing is, people need help,
especially in times like these.

724
00:42:38,212 --> 00:42:40,013
That's very noble of you.

725
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:43,016
You know...

726
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:45,421
I just have one final question.

727
00:42:58,267 --> 00:43:00,967
He hasn't had his turn yet.

728
00:43:00,969 --> 00:43:02,402
Mr. Curran?

729
00:43:02,404 --> 00:43:04,172
Your bag.

730
00:43:08,176 --> 00:43:10,409
- Wait, Tyson, no. Wait, Tyson!
- Hey!

731
00:43:10,411 --> 00:43:11,381
Can I help you?

732
00:43:18,988 --> 00:43:20,654
Truth or dare?

733
00:43:20,656 --> 00:43:23,457
I'm sorry, I beg your pardon?

734
00:43:23,459 --> 00:43:25,759
Truth or dare?

735
00:43:25,761 --> 00:43:28,261
Truth, I guess.

736
00:43:28,263 --> 00:43:31,230
Did my friends
really put you up to this?

737
00:43:31,232 --> 00:43:33,132
How long have you been
forging prescriptions?

738
00:43:33,134 --> 00:43:35,971
I don't.

739
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,440
Did she actually tell you that?

740
00:43:40,442 --> 00:43:42,542
- Excuse me?
- I don't forge prescriptions.

741
00:43:42,544 --> 00:43:44,714
Why would you even ask me that?

742
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:49,016
Um...

743
00:43:49,018 --> 00:43:51,350
- Ty! Ty! Ty! Open the door!
- Hey! Hey! - Hey, Tyson!

744
00:43:54,656 --> 00:43:56,390
- Tyson! - Tyson!
- Are you okay?

745
00:43:56,392 --> 00:43:58,091
- Open the door!
- Ty! - Ty! Hey!

746
00:43:58,093 --> 00:43:59,259
What are you doing?

747
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:02,362
Oh! Oh, my... Oh, my God!

748
00:44:02,364 --> 00:44:04,698
Oh, my God!

749
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,201
My God!

750
00:44:16,044 --> 00:44:18,645
Tyson lied
and then died because of it.

751
00:44:18,647 --> 00:44:22,214
Just like Ronnie did
when he didn't do the dare.

752
00:44:22,216 --> 00:44:24,216
Then my turn's next.

753
00:44:24,218 --> 00:44:26,420
Yeah, pick truth.

754
00:44:26,422 --> 00:44:28,821
I mean, listen,
we-we all should, right?

755
00:44:28,823 --> 00:44:30,457
And then whatever question
that we get asked,

756
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:32,058
we just answer it
with a hundred percent honesty.

757
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,627
Okay? That's how
we're gonna survive

758
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:35,364
till we figure this out.

759
00:44:37,332 --> 00:44:41,036
We got it?
Only choose truth.

760
00:44:42,337 --> 00:44:44,136
<i>Need more vodka.</i>

761
00:44:44,138 --> 00:44:46,573
You need sleep.

762
00:44:46,575 --> 00:44:49,408
Okay, I'll put her in bed.

763
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:51,210
You guys find Carter.

764
00:44:51,212 --> 00:44:54,182
He started all this.
Maybe he can end it.

765
00:45:02,524 --> 00:45:04,093
He said that he went to USC.

766
00:45:06,661 --> 00:45:09,429
Five Carters,
none of them our guy.

767
00:45:09,431 --> 00:45:11,698
Maybe he meant the other USC.

768
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,234
All right, she's asleep.
Did you find Carter yet?

769
00:45:14,236 --> 00:45:17,239
- No. Dead end.
- Did you try using Google?

770
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:21,244
Search "Mexico truth or dare."

771
00:45:59,814 --> 00:46:01,583
Uh, guys?

772
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:09,556
"Suspect Giselle Hammond, 22,
an American college student,

00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:38,350
- No!
- I'm sorry, I don't have a choice.

784
00:46:38,352 --> 00:46:39,788
Holy shit.

785
00:46:42,823 --> 00:46:44,958
- Did they catch her?
- Uh...

786
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,497
No, no, it says there's
still an ongoing search.

787
00:46:49,864 --> 00:46:51,466
I just found her on Facebook.

788
00:46:59,373 --> 00:47:01,875
- Oh, my God, it's him.
- Is he tagged?

789
00:47:01,877 --> 00:47:03,877
No, I don't see him
in any other photos.

790
00:47:03,879 --> 00:47:05,679
Look at her wall.
Maybe he posted.

791
00:47:05,681 --> 00:47:06,946
Well, not that I see.

792
00:47:06,948 --> 00:47:08,815
But... there's a bunch of posts

793
00:47:08,817 --> 00:47:10,549
about people asking her
to turn herself in,

794
00:47:10,551 --> 00:47:12,451
stuff like that.

795
00:47:12,453 --> 00:47:14,453
Wait, do you think
she's checking this?

796
00:47:14,455 --> 00:47:16,989
- DM her.
- Wait.

797
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:19,926
Just, uh, make a fake account.

798
00:47:19,928 --> 00:47:23,299
- We don't want this shit traced to us.
- Yeah.

799
00:47:25,834 --> 00:47:29,236
So, we're here on
our first vacation together.

800
00:47:29,238 --> 00:47:30,870
- Is it our first vacation together? Kinda?
- The beach.

801
00:47:30,872 --> 00:47:33,473
Um, I mean, there was
that time you came and visited

802
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:35,542
me and my family in Texas,

803
00:47:35,544 --> 00:47:37,509
- but...
- You're from Texas?

804
00:47:37,511 --> 00:47:40,513
I thought you were from Mexico.

805
00:47:40,515 --> 00:47:42,515
I'm not from Mexico!

806
00:47:42,517 --> 00:47:44,250
Tyson!

807
00:47:51,759 --> 00:47:55,995
We're playing the game, too.

808
00:47:55,997 --> 00:47:58,797
We need your help.

809
00:47:58,799 --> 00:48:01,268
- Please meet me.
- This woman is wanted for murder.

810
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:03,770
Do you really think she's gonna
come out of hiding for

811
00:48:03,772 --> 00:48:05,708
"We need your help"?

812
00:48:07,743 --> 00:48:10,712
I know the game dared you
to set that woman on fire.

813
00:48:12,013 --> 00:48:14,513
Tell me where to meet you,

814
00:48:14,515 --> 00:48:16,750
or I'll wait outside
your family's house

815
00:48:16,752 --> 00:48:19,752
until the game dares me
to do the same to them.

816
00:48:19,754 --> 00:48:21,420
Markie, you cannot send that.

817
00:48:21,422 --> 00:48:24,024
If you want to live,
you need to stop thinking

818
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:27,263
about other people and start
thinking about yourself.

819
00:48:50,718 --> 00:48:53,420
Truth or dare, beautiful?

820
00:48:55,623 --> 00:48:58,324
What? Hard to make a decision

821
00:48:58,326 --> 00:49:00,592
without Tyson telling you
what to do?

822
00:49:00,594 --> 00:49:03,663
Screw you.

823
00:49:03,665 --> 00:49:05,065
Truth.

824
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,933
Truth or dare?

825
00:49:06,935 --> 00:49:08,801
I said truth.

826
00:49:08,803 --> 00:49:10,670
Sorry.

827
00:49:10,672 --> 00:49:13,540
That's not how this game works.

828
00:49:13,542 --> 00:49:16,645
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

829
00:49:20,114 --> 00:49:22,348
Be patient. She'll write back.

830
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:23,885
This is all my fault.

831
00:49:25,886 --> 00:49:27,823
- Hey, no, it's not.
- No, she's right.

832
00:49:29,924 --> 00:49:32,725
None of us wanted
to follow that creep.

833
00:49:32,727 --> 00:49:34,993
None of us wanted to play
that stupid game.

834
00:49:34,995 --> 00:49:38,464
The only reason I went
on that trip was for you.

835
00:49:38,466 --> 00:49:40,033
Remember?
You said you needed

836
00:49:40,035 --> 00:49:41,768
- your best friend.
- All right, come on...

837
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,603
No, but now I realize
it's not about friendship

838
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:45,871
or "I choose you,"
it was about me being there

839
00:49:45,873 --> 00:49:47,873
to cover your ass while
you hooked up with randoms!

840
00:49:47,875 --> 00:49:49,578
Hey.

841
00:49:52,681 --> 00:49:54,483
Screw you, Olivia.

842
00:49:57,085 --> 00:49:59,451
Was that necessary?

843
00:49:59,453 --> 00:50:01,487
Guys. Come outside.

844
00:50:01,489 --> 00:50:03,022
Now!

845
00:50:03,024 --> 00:50:04,993
Shit.

846
00:50:07,596 --> 00:50:09,596
Pen? What are you doing?

847
00:50:09,598 --> 00:50:12,031
I tried.
It wouldn't let me pick truth.

848
00:50:12,033 --> 00:50:13,933
I tried, I swear!

849
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:19,438
I have to walk the edge
until I finish this.

850
00:50:20,709 --> 00:50:22,544
Pen, you're gonna be fine.

851
00:50:25,614 --> 00:50:28,681
Okay, just go slow.
Take your time.

852
00:50:28,683 --> 00:50:31,650
- Oh! - Be careful!
- I'm gonna go up there.

853
00:50:31,652 --> 00:50:32,986
I'll try and grab her
if she loses her balance.

854
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:35,754
No, your hand's broken.
I'll go.

855
00:50:35,756 --> 00:50:37,757
Pen, just walk slowly, okay?

856
00:50:37,759 --> 00:50:40,025
Hey!

857
00:50:40,027 --> 00:50:42,127
Just take your time, okay?
Walk slowly.

858
00:50:42,129 --> 00:50:43,562
It's gonna be fine.

859
00:50:43,564 --> 00:50:44,663
- What do we do?
- Be careful.

860
00:50:44,665 --> 00:50:45,864
It's gonna be okay.

861
00:50:45,866 --> 00:50:48,600
You're gonna be okay.

862
00:50:48,602 --> 00:50:50,770
We need to grab something
in case she falls. Go inside.

863
00:50:50,772 --> 00:50:52,504
- I'm gonna clear a path.
- All right, let's go, let's go,

864
00:50:52,506 --> 00:50:54,507
let's go, let's go!

865
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:06,986
Pen? Be careful.

866
00:51:06,988 --> 00:51:09,656
- You're good, okay?
- Hey, will this work?

867
00:51:09,658 --> 00:51:12,125
What? Yeah. Yeah. Come on.

868
00:51:12,127 --> 00:51:14,861
Just get under her.

869
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:17,029
- Get under her and follow her.
- Be careful, Pen.

870
00:51:17,031 --> 00:51:19,699
- Oh, sh...
- Get back. Get back, get back.

871
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:21,634
No need to rush.

872
00:51:22,971 --> 00:51:25,571
It's okay. It's okay, Pen.

873
00:51:25,573 --> 00:51:27,742
Just take your time.
Take it slowly.

874
00:51:29,944 --> 00:51:32,814
Pen, just put one foot
in front of the other.

875
00:51:39,654 --> 00:51:41,687
Watch it, okay? Just go slow.

876
00:51:41,689 --> 00:51:43,556
You can do this.

877
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:45,895
We're right here.
We're here for you, okay?

878
00:51:51,665 --> 00:51:53,766
I see her. She's right there.

879
00:51:53,768 --> 00:51:55,171
Go. Go. Go.

880
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:00,272
- W-Wait, she's on the corner.
- There she is.

881
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:03,909
Get that stuff out of the way.

882
00:52:11,018 --> 00:52:13,920
Pen! Pen.

883
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:16,255
I'm coming. I'm coming.

884
00:52:17,725 --> 00:52:19,725
No, no, no,
don't get too close.

885
00:52:19,727 --> 00:52:21,995
If I, if I, if I cheat,
if I don't do the dare...

886
00:52:21,997 --> 00:52:24,531
I know. I know. Okay?

887
00:52:24,533 --> 00:52:27,799
But when you finish,
I'll be here to grab you.

888
00:52:27,801 --> 00:52:29,671
Just got to go around
this corner now, okay?

889
00:52:40,015 --> 00:52:41,781
Oh.

890
00:52:43,817 --> 00:52:45,754
Come on.

891
00:52:47,288 --> 00:52:50,790
Take your time, okay?

892
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,594
You're doing great, Pen.

893
00:52:55,596 --> 00:52:57,830
- Don't look down.
- Wait. Stay here. Stay below her.

894
00:52:57,832 --> 00:53:00,132
Okay.
Wait, where are you going?

895
00:53:00,134 --> 00:53:02,167
Hey, Pen.
Don't look at the fence.

896
00:53:02,169 --> 00:53:04,670
Okay? Look at me.
Okay? You're almost there.

897
00:53:04,672 --> 00:53:05,841
Just a little more.

898
00:53:18,252 --> 00:53:20,752
She's right above us.
Throw it on top.

899
00:53:20,754 --> 00:53:21,789
- You ready?
- Yeah.

900
00:53:24,926 --> 00:53:27,092
That's not gonna work.

901
00:53:31,031 --> 00:53:33,366
That might.

902
00:53:39,607 --> 00:53:41,040
- Whoa!
- Hey! Penelope!

903
00:53:41,042 --> 00:53:43,279
Shit.

904
00:53:46,948 --> 00:53:48,815
Guys, get back further!

905
00:53:48,817 --> 00:53:50,382
- Go, go, go, move back.
- Get back!

906
00:53:50,384 --> 00:53:52,185
One last sip.

907
00:54:05,332 --> 00:54:07,902
No, no, Pen! Hey, Pen! No! No!

908
00:54:10,404 --> 00:54:13,239
- Pen?
- She's not moving.

909
00:54:13,241 --> 00:54:14,243
Pen?

910
00:54:22,716 --> 00:54:24,884
Is this my bed?

911
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:31,290
Yeah.

912
00:54:31,292 --> 00:54:33,862
You're okay.

913
00:54:36,964 --> 00:54:40,234
I just got a Facebook message
from Giselle.

914
00:54:55,049 --> 00:54:58,350
We're sure this is a good idea,
meeting her here?

915
00:54:58,352 --> 00:54:59,752
What if the cops
trace her message?

916
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:01,154
No, she wrote us
on a fake account.

917
00:55:01,156 --> 00:55:03,156
Yeah, but that chick
lit somebody on fire.

918
00:55:03,158 --> 00:55:05,024
- She's probably nuts.
- I mean,

919
00:55:05,026 --> 00:55:06,395
do we really have another choice?

920
00:55:14,368 --> 00:55:16,736
I mean, we can talk
about this inside. Come on.

921
00:55:18,306 --> 00:55:20,242
Let's go.

922
00:55:22,343 --> 00:55:24,409
Inside?

923
00:55:24,411 --> 00:55:26,446
Uh-uh. Okay, all right,
that's far enough.

924
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:28,080
Can you tell us
what's happening?

925
00:55:28,082 --> 00:55:30,348
- Which one of you is Olivia?
- No, you answer

926
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:32,018
our question first:
How do you know Carter?

927
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:33,351
- Carter?
- You know, cut the crap.

928
00:55:33,353 --> 00:55:34,319
We saw the photo.

929
00:55:34,321 --> 00:55:36,855
He's the one who brought us
into this game.

930
00:55:36,857 --> 00:55:37,924
Uh, yeah, right, okay.

931
00:55:37,926 --> 00:55:40,359
- Carter, right.
- Did he bring you into this, too?

932
00:55:40,361 --> 00:55:42,228
N-No, uh, he didn't,
he didn't start this.

933
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:43,462
He was just one of my friends.

934
00:55:43,464 --> 00:55:46,933
We-we all went on a trip to
Mexico and got really wasted.

935
00:55:46,935 --> 00:55:50,002
We-we found this old church,
and we decided to party in it,

936
00:55:50,004 --> 00:55:52,170
and my roommate wanted to play
Truth or Dare, so we did,

937
00:55:52,172 --> 00:55:54,406
but when we got home, the game,
it just, it kept going.

938
00:55:54,408 --> 00:55:56,174
My roommate died first,
and then the other ones...

939
00:55:56,176 --> 00:55:59,112
- How is this possible?
- I wish I knew.

940
00:55:59,114 --> 00:56:01,047
You know, I thought
this was some kind of, like,

941
00:56:01,049 --> 00:56:03,015
karmic payback for Sam
trashing the place, you know?

942
00:56:03,017 --> 00:56:05,150
- Sam?
- Uh, yeah, Sam.

943
00:56:05,152 --> 00:56:07,018
He-he was...
one of my friends.

944
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:09,187
He-he got really drunk, and
he just started breaking stuff.

945
00:56:09,189 --> 00:56:11,824
I don't know, we were, we were
all being idiots.

946
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:13,893
Our friend
just had a turn in the game.

947
00:56:13,895 --> 00:56:16,362
It wouldn't let her pick truth.
Do you know why?

948
00:56:16,364 --> 00:56:17,797
It's how we played.

949
00:56:17,799 --> 00:56:19,464
We called it
two truths and a dare.

950
00:56:19,466 --> 00:56:21,466
If... if two people
picked truth in a row,

951
00:56:21,468 --> 00:56:23,435
then the next person
had to do a dare.

952
00:56:23,437 --> 00:56:25,471
Thought it was
more fun that way.

953
00:56:25,473 --> 00:56:29,275
More fun? Your asshole buddy
gave us a death sentence.

954
00:56:29,277 --> 00:56:31,076
Any more super dangerous rules
you want to tell us about?

955
00:56:31,078 --> 00:56:33,312
Easy, Pen.

956
00:56:33,314 --> 00:56:35,882
He-he told me he was dared
to find a new group to play,

957
00:56:35,884 --> 00:56:37,482
and that it had to be
at the mission.

958
00:56:37,484 --> 00:56:39,152
He didn't have a choice,
you know?

959
00:56:39,154 --> 00:56:40,987
Of course he did.

960
00:56:40,989 --> 00:56:42,989
Okay, so where is Carter now?

961
00:56:42,991 --> 00:56:44,891
I haven't talked to him
since he went back to Mexico.

962
00:56:44,893 --> 00:56:47,859
I thought that when he got
a new group to play

963
00:56:47,861 --> 00:56:49,895
that we-we would be out.
I can't believe he only got

964
00:56:49,897 --> 00:56:52,198
five of you to play.
If he would've got more,

965
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,167
then I would've had a longer
time before I had to go again.

966
00:56:55,169 --> 00:56:57,435
You got another turn?

967
00:56:57,437 --> 00:56:59,471
Okay, it's time to go, guys.

968
00:56:59,473 --> 00:57:01,040
Is this why
you're telling us the truth?

969
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:04,243
No, I, uh... I picked dare.

970
00:57:04,245 --> 00:57:06,078
Markie's right.
Let's get out of here.

971
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:08,116
Okay, we're leaving.
Come on, Olivia.

972
00:57:10,185 --> 00:57:12,884
I am so sorry, Olivia.

973
00:57:12,886 --> 00:57:15,453
How did you know my name
when I got here?

974
00:57:15,455 --> 00:57:18,026
I... I didn't put it
in the message.

975
00:57:19,326 --> 00:57:20,826
No! No!

976
00:57:20,828 --> 00:57:23,196
- No! Pen!
- Pen!

977
00:57:23,198 --> 00:57:24,931
No! No!

978
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:30,335
- Hold her down!
- I have to kill Olivia!

979
00:57:30,337 --> 00:57:32,304
Hold her down!

980
00:57:32,306 --> 00:57:34,243
Grab the gun.

981
00:57:36,343 --> 00:57:38,844
Stop moving.

982
00:57:38,846 --> 00:57:40,515
What the...?

983
00:57:42,183 --> 00:57:44,116
What? No! No!

984
00:57:44,118 --> 00:57:47,085
No! No! No!

985
00:57:48,989 --> 00:57:50,459
Oh, shit.

986
00:57:55,029 --> 00:57:57,964
What was she thinking?

987
00:57:57,966 --> 00:58:00,199
It wasn't her.

988
00:58:00,201 --> 00:58:02,201
Something took over,
like she was possessed.

989
00:58:02,203 --> 00:58:04,103
She didn't finish her dare.

990
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:06,272
Like Ronnie.

991
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:08,540
This is what happens.

992
00:58:08,542 --> 00:58:10,478
So what do we do?

993
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:15,017
We tell the truth.

994
00:58:25,493 --> 00:58:27,158
- Yeah, right away.
- <i>She was erratic,</i>

995
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,560
<i>said she had to kill me.</i>

996
00:58:28,562 --> 00:58:30,562
Then Penelope
pushed me out of the way,

997
00:58:30,564 --> 00:58:32,431
she shot her and then
turned the gun on herself.

998
00:58:32,433 --> 00:58:34,634
Were you aware that Giselle
Hammond was wanted for murder?

999
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:38,203
Yes. Yeah, we thought
that she knew someone

1000
00:58:38,205 --> 00:58:40,473
that we were looking for,
a guy that we met in Mexico.

1001
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:43,475
- His name was Carter.
- You don't know his last name?

1002
00:58:43,477 --> 00:58:45,243
No.

1003
00:58:45,245 --> 00:58:48,983
Any of these people
look like him?

1004
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:58,324
No. Who are they?

1005
00:58:58,326 --> 00:59:01,460
Five of Giselle Hammond's
friends... all deceased.

1006
00:59:01,462 --> 00:59:05,167
Three suicides, two accidental
deaths, all in three weeks.

1007
00:59:06,701 --> 00:59:09,402
And now you've lost
two friends.

1008
00:59:09,404 --> 00:59:12,404
I don't believe
in coincidences, Olivia.

1009
00:59:12,406 --> 00:59:14,073
I think this is all connected.

1010
00:59:14,075 --> 00:59:16,141
If you know how,
you need to tell me.

1011
00:59:16,143 --> 00:59:18,310
No, I promise.

1012
00:59:18,312 --> 00:59:20,946
If I did know, I would.

1013
00:59:20,948 --> 00:59:23,251
I hope so.

1014
00:59:29,457 --> 00:59:31,324
We'll be in touch.

1015
00:59:31,326 --> 00:59:34,429
Don't take any more vacations.

1016
00:59:37,064 --> 00:59:38,998
That did not go well.

1017
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,665
We told them the truth.

1018
00:59:40,667 --> 00:59:42,268
As much as we could.

1019
00:59:42,270 --> 00:59:44,103
Guys, the cops should be
the least of our concerns.

1020
00:59:44,105 --> 00:59:47,640
I mean, Penelope's dead
and Giselle gave us nothing.

1021
00:59:47,642 --> 00:59:50,643
She did say a new game
had to start at the mission.

1022
00:59:50,645 --> 00:59:52,645
That place has to be the key.

1023
00:59:52,647 --> 00:59:55,580
Brad.

1024
00:59:55,582 --> 00:59:57,750
Catch up
with you guys later.

1025
00:59:57,752 --> 00:59:59,284
- No, we shouldn't split up.
- No, it's okay.

1026
00:59:59,286 --> 01:00:00,553
My turn's not for a while.

1027
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:05,123
I'll deal with my father; you
deal with finding the mission.

1028
01:00:05,125 --> 01:00:07,062
Come on.

1029
01:00:11,265 --> 01:00:12,667
I think it was built in 1896.

1030
01:00:14,167 --> 01:00:16,335
Yeah, that really
narrows it down.

1031
01:00:16,337 --> 01:00:18,536
It's a start.

1032
01:00:18,538 --> 01:00:21,073
Oh, shit.
I got to grab my charger.

1033
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:23,011
Uh, I think you left
your bag in my room.

1034
01:00:55,076 --> 01:00:56,308
- Oh, my God.
- What?

1035
01:00:56,310 --> 01:00:58,680
Check this out.

1036
01:01:01,314 --> 01:01:05,116
It says there was a massacre
a few weeks later.

1037
01:01:05,118 --> 01:01:09,323
Only one survivor, lives in
the area, Inez Reyes, 19.

1038
01:01:49,797 --> 01:01:54,403
Truth or dare?

1039
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:07,745
Where is she? Liv!

1040
01:02:07,747 --> 01:02:09,415
- Hey! Hey!
- - Olivia.

1041
01:02:09,417 --> 01:02:11,484
- Are you okay?
- Where am I?

1042
01:02:11,486 --> 01:02:13,351
- Where am I?!
- What the hell are you...?

1043
01:02:13,353 --> 01:02:15,286
Who the... Hey, hey, hey!

1044
01:02:15,288 --> 01:02:16,654
Hey!

1045
01:02:16,656 --> 01:02:18,656
Are you okay?

1046
01:02:18,658 --> 01:02:20,525
Was that your turn?

1047
01:02:20,527 --> 01:02:22,495
Hey, hey, come back!

1048
01:02:22,497 --> 01:02:24,332
Come back!

1049
01:02:28,136 --> 01:02:31,469
Olivia, what did he say?

1050
01:02:35,243 --> 01:02:37,846
He dared me
to sleep with Lucas.

1051
01:02:40,147 --> 01:02:42,281
Why would you pick dare?

1052
01:02:42,283 --> 01:02:44,283
Because of what Giselle said.

1053
01:02:44,285 --> 01:02:45,783
I-If I picked truth,

1054
01:02:45,785 --> 01:02:48,756
I was just forcing
someone else to pick dare.

1055
01:02:52,292 --> 01:02:54,395
How noble.

1056
01:02:56,397 --> 01:02:59,230
Markie, I didn't know
that's what it would ask.

1057
01:02:59,232 --> 01:03:01,799
I don't think
he knew where he was.

1058
01:03:01,801 --> 01:03:03,636
- Are you guys okay?
- Yeah, I'm perfect.

1059
01:03:03,638 --> 01:03:05,337
Well, hey, hey.
Where are you going?

1060
01:03:05,339 --> 01:03:07,672
- Anywhere but here.
- What is going on?

1061
01:03:07,674 --> 01:03:10,312
Why don't you ask Olivia?

1062
01:03:16,183 --> 01:03:20,154
Will you please tell me
what the hell is going on?

1063
01:03:25,792 --> 01:03:27,792
I got my turn.

1064
01:03:27,794 --> 01:03:29,497
Yeah, and?

1065
01:03:38,205 --> 01:03:41,209
Mm, oh, hey, no.
Wh-What are we doing?

1066
01:03:45,245 --> 01:03:47,779
Oh, this is the dare.

1067
01:03:47,781 --> 01:03:49,681
I'm sorry.

1068
01:03:49,683 --> 01:03:51,616
Why didn't you pick truth?

1069
01:03:51,618 --> 01:03:54,620
I told Markie it was so that
you guys wouldn't have to,

1070
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:56,788
but that was a lie.

1071
01:03:56,790 --> 01:03:58,623
I chose dare because
there is something

1072
01:03:58,625 --> 01:04:00,259
that I can never tell Markie,

1073
01:04:00,261 --> 01:04:02,728
and I'm really afraid
the game's gonna make me do it.

1074
01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:03,895
It can't be that bad.

1075
01:04:06,433 --> 01:04:08,335
You have no idea.

1076
01:04:20,614 --> 01:04:22,681
What?

1077
01:04:24,384 --> 01:04:26,451
No, you are just doing this
because of the dare,

1078
01:04:26,453 --> 01:04:27,752
because you have to.

1079
01:04:27,754 --> 01:04:30,656
No, you have to.

1080
01:04:30,658 --> 01:04:32,326
I don't.

1081
01:05:07,794 --> 01:05:09,730
Look at me.

1082
01:05:13,567 --> 01:05:14,902
Truth or dare?

1083
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:20,038
Truth or dare?

1084
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:21,774
Tr-Truth!

1085
01:05:21,776 --> 01:05:24,042
Who are you truly in love with?

1086
01:05:30,451 --> 01:05:33,488
I care about you. I do.

1087
01:05:35,455 --> 01:05:37,892
I'm in love with Markie.

1088
01:05:41,895 --> 01:05:44,596
Liv, I'm sorry.
It was the game.

1089
01:05:44,598 --> 01:05:47,701
No, it was the truth.

1090
01:06:15,462 --> 01:06:17,763
Roy Cameron, 45 years old,

1091
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:19,665
attempts to make dinner.

1092
01:06:19,667 --> 01:06:21,433
Take one.

1093
01:06:21,435 --> 01:06:23,534
Whoa, a little faith, please.

1094
01:06:23,536 --> 01:06:25,603
Nobody makes a steak
like your old man.

1095
01:06:25,605 --> 01:06:27,973
Wait, Dad, I'm pescatarian now.

1096
01:06:27,975 --> 01:06:30,779
I know, honey.

1097
01:06:34,681 --> 01:06:36,382
Dad?

1098
01:06:36,384 --> 01:06:38,753
I miss you so much.

1099
01:06:41,654 --> 01:06:43,654
I miss you, too.

1100
01:06:43,656 --> 01:06:46,991
There's something that
I've been dying to ask you.

1101
01:06:50,864 --> 01:06:53,766
No.

1102
01:06:53,768 --> 01:06:56,167
She's not answering.

1103
01:06:56,169 --> 01:06:57,636
Wait. Come here.
Look at this.

1104
01:06:57,638 --> 01:06:59,571
There's no number,
but she lives in Tijuana.

1105
01:06:59,573 --> 01:07:00,906
That's less than
three hours away.

1106
01:07:00,908 --> 01:07:02,775
Who is she?

1107
01:07:02,777 --> 01:07:04,777
She's someone who might
be able to help us.

1108
01:07:04,779 --> 01:07:06,448
Come on.

1109
01:07:12,719 --> 01:07:15,987
Come on, sweetheart.

1110
01:07:15,989 --> 01:07:18,424
Time to pick.

1111
01:07:18,426 --> 01:07:20,958
Truth.

1112
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:24,562
The gun I used
to kill myself...

1113
01:07:24,564 --> 01:07:26,498
why do you keep it?

1114
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:29,902
Sometimes I think about
using it.

1115
01:07:29,904 --> 01:07:32,006
Maybe you should get it.

1116
01:07:39,078 --> 01:07:41,045
<i>I'm worried about Markie.</i>

1117
01:07:41,047 --> 01:07:43,815
I wish we would have
found her before we left.

1118
01:07:43,817 --> 01:07:46,518
Yeah, well, she doesn't want
to speak to me right now,

1119
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:49,455
so there's nothing we can do.

1120
01:07:51,491 --> 01:07:53,859
You know that secret
that you're keeping from her?

1121
01:07:53,861 --> 01:07:55,560
Maybe if you got it out,

1122
01:07:55,562 --> 01:07:57,696
- the game couldn't use it against you.
- No.

1123
01:07:57,698 --> 01:07:59,598
No one can ever know.

1124
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:02,667
Especially not Markie.
It would kill her.

1125
01:08:02,669 --> 01:08:05,904
I'll try her again
when we get there.

1126
01:08:48,282 --> 01:08:50,214
- Um...
- Can I help you?

1127
01:08:50,216 --> 01:08:52,918
S-Sorry. Um, we're looking
for Inez Reyes.

1128
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:54,986
She's my grandmother.
I watch after her.

1129
01:08:54,988 --> 01:08:57,155
We were just wondering
if we could speak to her.

1130
01:08:57,157 --> 01:08:59,525
She speaks to no one.

1131
01:08:59,527 --> 01:09:01,593
No. Please!

1132
01:09:01,595 --> 01:09:03,594
Our friends are dying
just like hers did.

1133
01:09:03,596 --> 01:09:05,200
We-we just need a few words.

1134
01:09:08,801 --> 01:09:10,802
I will ask.

1135
01:09:10,804 --> 01:09:14,873
And if you could...
show her this.

1136
01:09:14,875 --> 01:09:17,609
Show her that we were
at this mission

1137
01:09:17,611 --> 01:09:20,878
and that half the people
in this photo are now dead.

1138
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,649
Then maybe she'll talk to us.

1139
01:09:24,751 --> 01:09:28,286
She might see you,
but she will not speak to you.

1140
01:09:28,288 --> 01:09:31,088
She has not said a word
in 50 years.

1141
01:09:31,090 --> 01:09:33,560
Wait here.

1142
01:09:36,663 --> 01:09:40,198
She must have taken
a vow of silence, right?

1143
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:42,034
She was 19 when her friends
were butchered.

1144
01:09:42,036 --> 01:09:45,239
- Imagine what that did to her.
- I don't have to.

1145
01:10:05,925 --> 01:10:07,861
It's been over an hour.

1146
01:10:10,163 --> 01:10:12,164
Yeah, for someone
who doesn't speak,

1147
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:15,366
they seem to be doing
a lot of talking.

1148
01:10:15,368 --> 01:10:17,671
She will see you.

1149
01:10:20,741 --> 01:10:22,841
I'm sorry for the wait.

1150
01:10:22,843 --> 01:10:25,276
She has written
something for you.

1151
01:10:25,278 --> 01:10:28,045
What is it?

1152
01:10:28,047 --> 01:10:30,848
She would not let me read it.

1153
01:10:37,157 --> 01:10:40,562
Thank you for seeing us,
Miss Reyes.

1154
01:10:57,745 --> 01:10:59,677
"The mission was a convent

1155
01:10:59,679 --> 01:11:01,279
"where young women
went to find God.

1156
01:11:01,281 --> 01:11:05,851
"We were girls, so we played
silly games like Hide and Seek.

1157
01:11:05,853 --> 01:11:07,852
"But the priest
who ran the convent

1158
01:11:07,854 --> 01:11:09,987
"forced us to play
his own game.

1159
01:11:09,989 --> 01:11:12,824
"He let us hide, but then
he took the one he found.

1160
01:11:12,826 --> 01:11:15,363
"His pleasure was our pain.

1161
01:11:16,663 --> 01:11:18,829
"We suffered in silence.

1162
01:11:18,831 --> 01:11:20,265
"Then one of the girls
told a secret.

1163
01:11:20,267 --> 01:11:23,235
"She knew spells
that could call spirits,

1164
01:11:23,237 --> 01:11:26,370
"so she summoned
a demon named Calux.

1165
01:11:26,372 --> 01:11:28,140
He possessed our game."

1166
01:11:28,142 --> 01:11:29,711
Possessed the game?

1167
01:11:41,721 --> 01:11:45,824
"Demons possess people, places,

1168
01:11:45,826 --> 01:11:48,129
objects, even ideas."

1169
01:11:50,229 --> 01:11:51,797
Uh, uh...

1170
01:11:51,799 --> 01:11:53,231
"Calux is a trickster.

1171
01:11:53,233 --> 01:11:55,299
"That night, when the priest
found his victim,

1172
01:11:55,301 --> 01:11:57,468
"she was possessed by Calux.

1173
01:11:57,470 --> 01:12:00,204
"She hid the priest's body
in the mission...

1174
01:12:00,206 --> 01:12:02,074
"in pieces.

1175
01:12:02,076 --> 01:12:04,946
"It took them a week
to find his head.

1176
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:10,115
"But Calux didn't want to stop.

1177
01:12:10,117 --> 01:12:12,084
"He made us keep playing.

1178
01:12:12,086 --> 01:12:13,988
Many of my sisters died."

1179
01:12:16,090 --> 01:12:18,660
Wait, how did you
and the others escape?

1180
01:12:32,739 --> 01:12:35,473
"The person
who released the demon

1181
01:12:35,475 --> 01:12:37,342
"can trap it
with a simple ritual,

1182
01:12:37,344 --> 01:12:39,380
but only by his own hand."

1183
01:12:43,884 --> 01:12:47,218
Uh, this is the spell?
Uh, it's in Spanish.

1184
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:49,987
"The spell must be
repeated seven times

1185
01:12:49,989 --> 01:12:53,361
"and a sacrifice must be placed
in a pot sealed with wax.

1186
01:13:00,768 --> 01:13:03,968
"As long as the pot
stays sealed in the mission,

1187
01:13:03,970 --> 01:13:08,942
the door we opened for Calux
will also be sealed."

1188
01:13:11,044 --> 01:13:13,480
Wait, I've seen
that pot before.

1189
01:13:17,483 --> 01:13:19,284
Yeah. Look.

1190
01:13:19,286 --> 01:13:21,285
But when I saw it,
it was broken

1191
01:13:21,287 --> 01:13:24,054
and there was something inside
it and it smelled rotten.

1192
01:13:46,513 --> 01:13:50,115
"Whoever broke the pot
will have to do the same."

1193
01:13:50,117 --> 01:13:52,350
What was it?
The sacrifice.

1194
01:14:03,897 --> 01:14:06,334
It was you
who summoned the demon?

1195
01:14:31,123 --> 01:14:34,058
It's been a few years
since AP Spanish,

1196
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:37,462
but I think it says,
"I have called upon an evil.

1197
01:14:37,464 --> 01:14:41,566
Silence my voice,
so the evil is no more."

1198
01:14:41,568 --> 01:14:44,134
So when Carter and his friends
broke the pot at the mission...

1199
01:14:44,136 --> 01:14:45,070
The demon was freed

1200
01:14:45,072 --> 01:14:46,605
and possessed their game
of Truth or Dare.

1201
01:14:46,607 --> 01:14:48,606
And we have to find
whoever broke that pot.

1202
01:14:48,608 --> 01:14:50,976
But Giselle said somebody
named Sam trashed the place.

1203
01:14:50,978 --> 01:14:53,244
And we have no idea who Sam is.

1204
01:14:53,246 --> 01:14:56,481
- Or if he's even still alive.
- And if we do find him...

1205
01:14:56,483 --> 01:14:58,048
What?

1206
01:14:58,050 --> 01:15:00,285
"Hi, Sam. Do you mind
cutting out your tongue

1207
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:03,157
and sealing it in this
lovely handmade pot?"

1208
01:15:04,892 --> 01:15:06,324
I'll check
Giselle's Facebook again,

1209
01:15:06,326 --> 01:15:08,062
see if there's a Sam tagged.

1210
01:15:09,295 --> 01:15:10,561
Still nothing from Markie?

1211
01:15:10,563 --> 01:15:13,397
She's ignoring all my texts.

1212
01:15:13,399 --> 01:15:14,665
Her turn's next.

1213
01:15:14,667 --> 01:15:16,368
I'm gonna try
calling her again.

1214
01:15:18,572 --> 01:15:21,138
Brad? Brad!

1215
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:23,008
It's your father.

1216
01:15:23,010 --> 01:15:26,378
Since Penelope, he's been...

1217
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:27,614
I'll get rid of him.

1218
01:15:34,921 --> 01:15:36,857
Let's talk outside.

1219
01:15:46,198 --> 01:15:47,699
I'm gonna grab coffee.

1220
01:15:49,068 --> 01:15:51,102
Look, uh, I'm hearing
some things

1221
01:15:51,104 --> 01:15:53,103
about your, uh,
friend's murder.

1222
01:15:53,105 --> 01:15:56,274
Kranis in Homicide isn't
convinced it's so simple.

1223
01:15:56,276 --> 01:16:00,244
I know I don't need
to ask this, but...

1224
01:16:00,246 --> 01:16:02,246
is there something
you're not telling us?

1225
01:16:02,248 --> 01:16:03,647
No, I-I promise.

1226
01:16:03,649 --> 01:16:05,417
Everything we told you
was true.

1227
01:16:08,721 --> 01:16:11,455
Markie, thank God.

1228
01:16:11,457 --> 01:16:12,990
Why are you telling me
all this?

1229
01:16:12,992 --> 01:16:14,392
'Cause I know Kranis is wrong,

1230
01:16:14,394 --> 01:16:16,328
and I want you to know
what's going on.

1231
01:16:16,330 --> 01:16:17,561
Look, you don't have to worry.

1232
01:16:17,563 --> 01:16:20,133
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

1233
01:16:21,401 --> 01:16:23,504
You're still my son, Brad.

1234
01:16:30,376 --> 01:16:33,477
- You gonna get that?
- Get what?

1235
01:16:33,479 --> 01:16:36,981
Truth or dare, Brad?

1236
01:16:36,983 --> 01:16:38,717
Yeah, I guess
I just needed some time alone.

1237
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:40,051
No, no, no.
It's-it's fine.

1238
01:16:40,053 --> 01:16:41,453
Just get here
as fast as you can.

1239
01:16:41,455 --> 01:16:43,454
And please be careful.
Your turn's next.

1240
01:16:43,456 --> 01:16:46,324
I had my turn.
I chose truth.

1241
01:16:46,326 --> 01:16:48,392
So did Lucas.

1242
01:16:48,394 --> 01:16:51,362
And if the both of you
picked truth...

1243
01:16:51,364 --> 01:16:53,365
You only have one choice.

1244
01:16:53,367 --> 01:16:55,033
You sure there's nothing
you need to tell me?

1245
01:16:55,035 --> 01:16:57,735
I dare you to steal his gun

1246
01:16:57,737 --> 01:17:00,739
and make him beg for his life.

1247
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:02,374
Son?

1248
01:17:02,376 --> 01:17:06,710
Thank you, Dad, for everything.

1249
01:17:06,712 --> 01:17:10,347
It's just, uh, there's just
one more thing I need to do,

1250
01:17:10,349 --> 01:17:12,217
and I hope you can forgive me.

1251
01:17:12,219 --> 01:17:15,219
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Of course.

1252
01:17:15,221 --> 01:17:16,724
For what?

1253
01:17:22,795 --> 01:17:25,065
It's okay.

1254
01:17:28,068 --> 01:17:30,468
I need you to beg.
For your life.

1255
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:32,603
- The hell are you doing?
- Beg for your life!

1256
01:17:32,605 --> 01:17:34,772
Brad, please, put the gun down!

1257
01:17:34,774 --> 01:17:36,775
- Just do as I say or I'll die.
- You don't have to do this!

1258
01:17:36,777 --> 01:17:39,343
- Get on your knees.
- We have to go. Now!

1259
01:17:39,345 --> 01:17:41,212
Do as I say.
I'll explain everything, okay?

1260
01:17:41,214 --> 01:17:42,446
- I know I've been hard on you.
- Listen. No!

1261
01:17:42,448 --> 01:17:43,448
- And I'm sorry.
- No.

1262
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:44,585
That's not what this is about.

1263
01:17:50,357 --> 01:17:52,457
Beg! Please.
I'll explain everything.

1264
01:17:52,459 --> 01:17:54,225
- Just beg.
- I guess you think I deserve this.

1265
01:17:54,227 --> 01:17:55,759
No. No.

1266
01:17:55,761 --> 01:17:57,430
Just, just, just, just beg!

1267
01:18:02,102 --> 01:18:04,201
Please! Just beg
and I'll put down the gun.

1268
01:18:04,203 --> 01:18:05,637
- What's that gonna prove, Brad?
- Just beg,

1269
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:08,109
and I'll put down the gun! Beg!

1270
01:18:11,377 --> 01:18:13,143
No, no, no, no!

1271
01:18:13,145 --> 01:18:15,512
- No! No!
- Brad!

1272
01:18:15,514 --> 01:18:17,615
Brad! No, no, no! No!

1273
01:18:17,617 --> 01:18:18,783
No! No!

1274
01:18:18,785 --> 01:18:20,587
Get a paramedic!

1275
01:18:21,587 --> 01:18:23,387
Come on.

1276
01:18:23,389 --> 01:18:24,755
Brad, Brad! No, no, no.

1277
01:18:24,757 --> 01:18:26,557
Stay here.
You're gonna be fine.

1278
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:28,660
No! No!

1279
01:18:28,662 --> 01:18:30,765
I need a paramedic! Help!

1280
01:18:32,099 --> 01:18:34,468
I need a paramedic! Brad!

1281
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,776
I'm so sorry.

1282
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:53,685
Guys, can we get out of here?

1283
01:18:53,687 --> 01:18:55,820
I still need to talk
to the detective.

1284
01:18:55,822 --> 01:18:57,588
I shouldn't have picked truth.

1285
01:18:57,590 --> 01:18:59,257
No, it's not your fault.

1286
01:18:59,259 --> 01:19:01,392
I picked truth, too.

1287
01:19:01,394 --> 01:19:03,594
We shouldn't have
left Brad alone.

1288
01:19:03,596 --> 01:19:05,730
No, it wouldn't have mattered.

1289
01:19:05,732 --> 01:19:07,565
This game is smart.
It's too smart.

1290
01:19:07,567 --> 01:19:09,566
We're not playing it;
it's playing us.

1291
01:19:09,568 --> 01:19:11,401
And none of this
is a coincidence.

1292
01:19:11,403 --> 01:19:13,204
It waits for our most
vulnerable moments,

1293
01:19:13,206 --> 01:19:15,539
and that's when it asks us.

1294
01:19:15,541 --> 01:19:18,442
Yeah,
you got that right, Olivia.

1295
01:19:18,444 --> 01:19:20,380
And now it's your turn.

1296
01:19:21,648 --> 01:19:24,218
Truth or dare?

1297
01:19:26,886 --> 01:19:29,286
What?

1298
01:19:29,288 --> 01:19:30,657
What is it?

1299
01:19:32,591 --> 01:19:34,859
Lucas just asked me.

1300
01:19:34,861 --> 01:19:36,628
No, I didn't.

1301
01:19:36,630 --> 01:19:37,765
Truth or dare, Olivia?

1302
01:19:39,398 --> 01:19:42,667
O-Okay.
Okay, you have to pick truth.

1303
01:19:42,669 --> 01:19:45,203
Olivia, do it.

1304
01:19:45,205 --> 01:19:46,637
- Dare.
- Olivia!

1305
01:19:46,639 --> 01:19:49,740
I dare you...

1306
01:19:49,742 --> 01:19:52,312
to tell Markie
the secret you fear most.

1307
01:19:54,781 --> 01:19:57,484
What? Wh-What is it
making you do?

1308
01:20:00,586 --> 01:20:03,491
Markie, there's something
important I need to tell you.

1309
01:20:08,394 --> 01:20:10,196
What?

1310
01:20:12,898 --> 01:20:15,533
I was there
the night your dad died.

1311
01:20:15,535 --> 01:20:18,602
I know what happened.

1312
01:20:18,604 --> 01:20:20,471
What?

1313
01:20:20,473 --> 01:20:22,707
What are you talking about?

1314
01:20:22,709 --> 01:20:25,410
I had gotten into a fight
with my parents,

1315
01:20:25,412 --> 01:20:27,779
so I went to your house.

1316
01:20:27,781 --> 01:20:31,382
You weren't there,
so your dad let me in.

1317
01:20:31,384 --> 01:20:34,985
He... he was drinking,
and he offered me one,

1318
01:20:34,987 --> 01:20:36,620
so I took it.

1319
01:20:36,622 --> 01:20:38,690
We had a few,
and then he told me

1320
01:20:38,692 --> 01:20:40,924
that he had been fired
that day, 'cause he was,

1321
01:20:40,926 --> 01:20:43,561
he was drinking on the job,
and I just,

1322
01:20:43,563 --> 01:20:46,231
I felt really bad for him.

1323
01:20:46,233 --> 01:20:49,234
But I told him that you and I

1324
01:20:49,236 --> 01:20:51,305
would help him
figure things out.

1325
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:58,642
And then he called me
beautiful.

1326
01:20:58,644 --> 01:21:02,746
And... I was drunk,
and I didn't know what to do,

1327
01:21:02,748 --> 01:21:04,816
and then he leaned in
to kiss me,

1328
01:21:04,818 --> 01:21:06,316
and I-I tried to push him off.

1329
01:21:06,318 --> 01:21:07,819
I didn't do it, but he...

1330
01:21:07,821 --> 01:21:10,420
he kept coming back stronger.

1331
01:21:10,422 --> 01:21:13,527
But finally, I-I got free.

1332
01:21:17,863 --> 01:21:20,464
He begged me to forgive him,

1333
01:21:20,466 --> 01:21:22,667
said that he needed help,
but I was so scared,

1334
01:21:22,669 --> 01:21:24,668
and I was confused,

1335
01:21:24,670 --> 01:21:26,670
and I threatened
to tell you what happened,

1336
01:21:26,672 --> 01:21:28,776
but he said that he would die
if you ever found out.

1337
01:21:32,479 --> 01:21:35,849
I-I told him that you'd be
better off if he were dead.

1338
01:21:38,518 --> 01:21:41,451
Markie, I am so sorry.

1339
01:21:41,453 --> 01:21:45,289
I wanted to tell you, but
by the time I got ahold of you,

1340
01:21:45,291 --> 01:21:47,825
he had already done it,
and you were devastated.

1341
01:21:47,827 --> 01:21:50,061
It broke my heart.
I didn't know what to do.

1342
01:21:50,063 --> 01:21:52,062
- Trust me, I..
- No.

1343
01:21:52,064 --> 01:21:53,765
No, I'll never trust you again.

1344
01:21:53,767 --> 01:21:56,700
- Markie...
- Don't!

1345
01:21:56,702 --> 01:21:58,404
Don't.

1346
01:21:59,805 --> 01:22:01,972
Miss Barron.

1347
01:22:01,974 --> 01:22:03,740
You're up.

1348
01:22:03,742 --> 01:22:06,710
<i>"I know the game</i>

1349
01:22:06,712 --> 01:22:08,812
"dared you
to set that woman on fire.

1350
01:22:08,814 --> 01:22:10,647
"Tell me where to meet you,

1351
01:22:10,649 --> 01:22:12,650
"or I'll wait outside
your family's house

1352
01:22:12,652 --> 01:22:15,852
until the game dares me
to do the same to them."

1353
01:22:15,854 --> 01:22:18,923
That is... quite a threat.

1354
01:22:18,925 --> 01:22:21,459
We traced the I.P.
to your laptop.

1355
01:22:21,461 --> 01:22:23,460
I-I know that that...

1356
01:22:23,462 --> 01:22:25,429
looks bad, but I...

1357
01:22:25,431 --> 01:22:27,432
I just needed
to get her attention.

1358
01:22:27,434 --> 01:22:28,999
Yeah, I know
you're playing some kind

1359
01:22:29,001 --> 01:22:30,868
of Truth or Dare game,
but what I don't understand is:

1360
01:22:30,870 --> 01:22:32,003
why are people dying?

1361
01:22:32,005 --> 01:22:33,838
There's only four of you left.

1362
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:37,075
- I'd like to keep the rest of you guys alive.
- Four?

1363
01:22:37,077 --> 01:22:38,709
Everyone who's dead
was in Mexico.

1364
01:22:38,711 --> 01:22:40,610
That leaves you,
Markie and Lucas,

1365
01:22:40,612 --> 01:22:42,315
and Giselle's friend,
Sam Meehan.

1366
01:22:43,716 --> 01:22:45,516
Sam?

1367
01:22:45,518 --> 01:22:47,485
Wait, he's alive?

1368
01:22:47,487 --> 01:22:48,956
You know him?

1369
01:22:53,526 --> 01:22:55,426
No.

1370
01:22:55,428 --> 01:22:58,529
No, that-that's just someone
that Giselle had mentioned.

1371
01:22:58,531 --> 01:23:00,530
Ah. He's holed up
in an apartment.

1372
01:23:00,532 --> 01:23:02,834
Won't talk to anybody.
Said I had to arrest him

1373
01:23:02,836 --> 01:23:04,936
if I wanted to speak
to him again.

1374
01:23:04,938 --> 01:23:07,672
Olivia, what the hell
is happening here?

1375
01:23:07,674 --> 01:23:09,906
Could I get some water, please?

1376
01:23:11,544 --> 01:23:13,479
Thanks.

1377
01:23:18,818 --> 01:23:20,752
Marcus, I'm gonna
need a glass of water.

1378
01:23:20,754 --> 01:23:22,488
Yes, sir, right away.

1379
01:23:26,425 --> 01:23:28,125
Am I being charged?

1380
01:23:28,127 --> 01:23:30,460
Not yet.

1381
01:23:30,462 --> 01:23:32,733
Okay, then I need to go.

1382
01:24:23,215 --> 01:24:24,915
Carter is Sam.

1383
01:24:24,917 --> 01:24:26,950
He was using a fake name.

1384
01:24:26,952 --> 01:24:28,985
But Giselle acted like
they were different people?

1385
01:24:28,987 --> 01:24:31,054
Well, she was probably
trying to protect him,

1386
01:24:31,056 --> 01:24:34,158
but she slipped up and she
used his real name. Come on.

1387
01:25:18,938 --> 01:25:21,675
Markie? Markie!

1388
01:25:25,010 --> 01:25:26,647
Markie?

1389
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:35,151
Markie, please open the door.
We need to talk.

1390
01:25:41,126 --> 01:25:43,694
What are you doing?

1391
01:25:43,696 --> 01:25:45,795
What my father did.

1392
01:25:45,797 --> 01:25:48,231
Markie, please put it down.

1393
01:25:48,233 --> 01:25:51,035
Why?

1394
01:25:51,037 --> 01:25:52,802
I don't have anything.

1395
01:25:52,804 --> 01:25:55,039
You have me.

1396
01:25:55,041 --> 01:25:58,042
No.

1397
01:25:58,044 --> 01:26:00,544
Now the game has us.

1398
01:26:00,546 --> 01:26:04,248
I hid the truth about your dad
to protect you.

1399
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:07,250
But I was wrong.

1400
01:26:07,252 --> 01:26:09,085
Every single day,

1401
01:26:09,087 --> 01:26:11,757
I wish I could take back
what I said to him.

1402
01:26:13,826 --> 01:26:16,063
And he tried before.

1403
01:26:18,264 --> 01:26:22,066
It's not your fault.

1404
01:26:24,069 --> 01:26:27,905
We can't change the past.

1405
01:26:27,907 --> 01:26:29,906
But we can still have a future.

1406
01:26:29,908 --> 01:26:31,909
We can end this game.

1407
01:26:31,911 --> 01:26:34,078
How?

1408
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:36,517
Carter... I know where he is.

1409
01:26:53,232 --> 01:26:54,899
Okay, so what's the plan?

1410
01:26:54,901 --> 01:26:57,834
- We just have to get him back to the mission.
- Okay.

1411
01:26:57,836 --> 01:27:01,071
So don't open with "We need you
to cut out your own tongue"?

1412
01:27:01,073 --> 01:27:04,874
Here it is. Six.

1413
01:27:04,876 --> 01:27:08,044
Go away!
I don't want to talk to anyone!

1414
01:27:08,046 --> 01:27:09,981
Screw this.

1415
01:27:09,983 --> 01:27:11,182
You...

1416
01:27:11,184 --> 01:27:12,383
- Wait, wait, wait!
- Carter!

1417
01:27:12,385 --> 01:27:14,051
Or is it Sam?

1418
01:27:14,053 --> 01:27:16,119
- How did you find me?
- We were motivated.

1419
01:27:16,121 --> 01:27:18,155
- What the hell happened in here?
- The game.

1420
01:27:18,157 --> 01:27:21,825
No contact with the outside.
Nothing in here can hurt me.

1421
01:27:21,827 --> 01:27:25,228
- This is your plan?
- My plan is to wait it out.

1422
01:27:25,230 --> 01:27:26,731
No, that was your second plan.

1423
01:27:26,733 --> 01:27:28,199
Your first plan
was to screw us.

1424
01:27:28,201 --> 01:27:31,768
Three of my best friends
are dead because of you!

1425
01:27:31,770 --> 01:27:34,070
I'm sorry.
I lost friends, too, okay?

1426
01:27:34,072 --> 01:27:36,140
If I could take it all back,
I would.

1427
01:27:36,142 --> 01:27:37,642
There is a way.

1428
01:27:37,644 --> 01:27:40,043
But we all have to go back
to the mission.

1429
01:27:40,045 --> 01:27:42,213
A way to what?
To what, end the game? How?

1430
01:27:42,215 --> 01:27:45,953
Just... trust me.
We have to go back.

1431
01:27:49,022 --> 01:27:52,255
Uh-uh. No, this is
another dare, right?

1432
01:27:52,257 --> 01:27:55,058
- The game's daring you to lure me out? Is that...
- No.

1433
01:27:55,060 --> 01:27:57,395
She's telling the truth.

1434
01:27:57,397 --> 01:27:59,730
And why should I trust you?

1435
01:27:59,732 --> 01:28:01,899
Because we want
the same thing.

1436
01:28:01,901 --> 01:28:03,303
We want to survive.

1437
01:28:05,337 --> 01:28:07,338
Look...

1438
01:28:07,340 --> 01:28:10,274
I'm gonna tell you what you
should've told me at the bar.

1439
01:28:10,276 --> 01:28:12,144
Piss off.

1440
01:28:19,152 --> 01:28:22,085
Okay, sweet little Olivia's
not shooting anyone.

1441
01:28:22,087 --> 01:28:25,257
Try me. I dare you.

1442
01:28:33,232 --> 01:28:35,132
- Come on, let's go.
- I am moving.

1443
01:28:35,134 --> 01:28:38,069
Right through here.

1444
01:28:38,071 --> 01:28:40,006
Go.

1445
01:28:53,419 --> 01:28:55,886
Is this ritual
that old nun told you about

1446
01:28:55,888 --> 01:28:57,288
actually gonna work?

1447
01:28:57,290 --> 01:28:59,660
There's only one way
to find out.

1448
01:29:08,067 --> 01:29:11,235
So we're gonna end this
with a séance?

1449
01:29:11,237 --> 01:29:14,003
We are not ending it.
You are.

1450
01:29:14,005 --> 01:29:16,440
Me? I tried.

1451
01:29:16,442 --> 01:29:18,812
We all know how that
turned out.

1452
01:29:23,315 --> 01:29:25,452
Stay down.

1453
01:29:27,053 --> 01:29:29,520
Here. Take this. Take it!

1454
01:29:29,522 --> 01:29:31,358
Say it seven times.

1455
01:29:37,063 --> 01:29:39,295
What are you
gonna do with that?

1456
01:29:39,297 --> 01:29:42,169
I'm giving it to you.

1457
01:29:43,269 --> 01:29:45,369
Take it. Now!

1458
01:29:45,371 --> 01:29:48,405
Now say the words seven times.

1459
01:29:48,407 --> 01:29:49,807
Go!

1460
01:29:49,809 --> 01:29:51,040
Uh...

1461
01:29:51,042 --> 01:29:53,377
<i>"Hermaro almas..."</i>

1462
01:29:58,151 --> 01:30:00,851
- Did you feel that?
- Don't stop.

1463
01:30:00,853 --> 01:30:03,219
- Just-just tell me what's going on!
- Keep going!

1464
01:30:03,221 --> 01:30:06,156
All right...

1465
01:30:06,158 --> 01:30:09,093
<i>"...silencia mi voz para que
el mal no sea más.</i>

1466
01:30:11,296 --> 01:30:13,496
Say it again.

1467
01:30:13,498 --> 01:30:14,698
<i>"Hermaro almas,</i>

1468
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:18,134
<i>silencia mi voz para que
el mal no sea más."</i>

1469
01:30:21,573 --> 01:30:23,406
Five more times.

1470
01:30:23,408 --> 01:30:25,308
<i>"Hermaro almas,
silencia mi voz</i>

1471
01:30:25,310 --> 01:30:27,214
<i>para que el mal no sea más."</i>

1472
01:30:29,314 --> 01:30:31,315
Truth or dare, Lucas?

1473
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:38,121
Dare.

1474
01:30:40,358 --> 01:30:42,826
<i>"Hermaro almas,
silencia mi voz</i>

1475
01:30:42,828 --> 01:30:44,829
<i>mi voz para que el mal no..."</i>

1476
01:30:44,831 --> 01:30:47,130
- Where are you going?
- Just got to get away from here.

1477
01:30:47,132 --> 01:30:49,200
Wait, wait, wait.
You can't go.

1478
01:30:49,202 --> 01:30:50,567
Your turn's next.

1479
01:30:50,569 --> 01:30:53,337
I just had my turn.

1480
01:30:53,339 --> 01:30:55,873
- Got to get away from you both.
- Why?

1481
01:30:55,875 --> 01:30:57,575
Because it dared me to choose.

1482
01:30:57,577 --> 01:30:59,043
You already have.
You love Markie.

1483
01:30:59,045 --> 01:31:01,014
Choose which one of you
to kill.

1484
01:31:06,352 --> 01:31:07,450
Luke.

1485
01:31:07,452 --> 01:31:09,453
What, so he's just leaving?!

1486
01:31:09,455 --> 01:31:11,187
Don't stop.
Two more times.

1487
01:31:11,189 --> 01:31:12,623
<i>"Hermaro almas,</i>

1488
01:31:12,625 --> 01:31:15,426
<i>silencia mi voz para que
el mal no sea más."</i>

1489
01:31:15,428 --> 01:31:16,893
Luke?

1490
01:31:16,895 --> 01:31:19,562
Luke? Why did you pick dare?

1491
01:31:19,564 --> 01:31:22,199
Because I knew if I didn't,
then one of you would have to.

1492
01:31:22,201 --> 01:31:24,267
And we're so close.

1493
01:31:24,269 --> 01:31:26,203
And I won't let
the game kill you.

1494
01:31:26,205 --> 01:31:29,272
You're such an idiot.

1495
01:31:29,274 --> 01:31:32,008
What can I say?

1496
01:31:32,010 --> 01:31:34,011
You do that to me.

1497
01:31:46,224 --> 01:31:51,094
<i>"Hermaro almas, silencia mi voz
para que el mal no sea más."</i>

1498
01:31:53,899 --> 01:31:55,531
That's seven.

1499
01:31:55,533 --> 01:31:57,534
We got to get out of here.
This place is coming down.

1500
01:31:57,536 --> 01:31:59,069
No, there's one more thing
to do.

1501
01:31:59,071 --> 01:32:01,237
Pick up the knife.

1502
01:32:01,239 --> 01:32:03,042
I can't do it for you.

1503
01:32:04,609 --> 01:32:06,513
Pick it up!

1504
01:32:09,014 --> 01:32:10,481
And do what?

1505
01:32:10,483 --> 01:32:12,682
I'm so sorry, Sam.

1506
01:32:12,684 --> 01:32:14,584
But you unleashed this evil,

1507
01:32:14,586 --> 01:32:17,687
which means you're the only one
who can stop it.

1508
01:32:19,692 --> 01:32:22,159
I need you to cut out
your tongue.

1509
01:32:22,161 --> 01:32:24,695
N-No, that's insane.

1510
01:32:24,697 --> 01:32:26,696
Please!
It's the only way we survive!

1511
01:32:34,607 --> 01:32:36,573
You take care of each other.

1512
01:32:36,575 --> 01:32:39,479
No.

1513
01:32:53,591 --> 01:32:55,895
- No. No.
- Do it.

1514
01:33:00,332 --> 01:33:02,132
- Lucas, stop!
- That's not Lucas.

1515
01:33:02,134 --> 01:33:04,401
Do it now, Carter.

1516
01:33:04,403 --> 01:33:07,137
Before it's too late!

1517
01:33:07,139 --> 01:33:08,371
Don't you want to live?!

1518
01:33:08,373 --> 01:33:11,508
You do not have a choice!
Do it!

1519
01:33:11,510 --> 01:33:14,648
I can't believe
I'm about to do this.

1520
01:33:21,987 --> 01:33:23,654
I will murder
everyone you've ever known!

1521
01:33:23,656 --> 01:33:26,190
No, they are not in this!
It's just us!

1522
01:33:26,192 --> 01:33:28,592
You're right.

1523
01:33:28,594 --> 01:33:31,527
But Lucas is,
and he didn't do his dare.

1524
01:33:31,529 --> 01:33:33,163
So now he dies.

1525
01:33:57,790 --> 01:33:59,125
No!

1526
01:34:21,279 --> 01:34:24,181
Lucas refused his dare
to save us.

1527
01:34:25,584 --> 01:34:28,185
We have to finish this.

1528
01:34:28,187 --> 01:34:30,654
Calux killed Carter.
The spell won't work.

1529
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:34,792
No, we lost the second
we started this game.

1530
01:34:34,794 --> 01:34:39,329
The second we came here.

1531
01:34:39,331 --> 01:34:41,432
Carter was dared
to bring us here,

1532
01:34:41,434 --> 01:34:44,634
because this is where you can
add new people to the game.

1533
01:34:44,636 --> 01:34:46,436
I have an idea.
Your turn's next.

1534
01:34:46,438 --> 01:34:48,672
When you're asked,
I need you to pick dare.

1535
01:34:48,674 --> 01:34:50,673
Why would I do that?

1536
01:34:50,675 --> 01:34:54,113
Markie...

1537
01:34:55,214 --> 01:34:56,746
Truth or dare?

1538
01:34:56,748 --> 01:34:59,516
Now Lucas is asking me.

1539
01:34:59,518 --> 01:35:01,517
Pick dare.

1540
01:35:01,519 --> 01:35:04,221
- But don't do it.
- What? I'll die.

1541
01:35:04,223 --> 01:35:06,255
Markie, I am so sorry

1542
01:35:06,257 --> 01:35:08,659
for keeping that secret
from you for so long.

1543
01:35:08,661 --> 01:35:10,393
And I swear to you

1544
01:35:10,395 --> 01:35:12,396
I will never, ever keep
anything from you again.

1545
01:35:12,398 --> 01:35:14,798
But we survive this
only if we trust each other.

1546
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:16,169
Okay?

1547
01:35:18,737 --> 01:35:21,237
- Okay.
- Trust me.

1548
01:35:21,239 --> 01:35:23,240
You have to pick.

1549
01:35:23,242 --> 01:35:24,874
Dare.

1550
01:35:24,876 --> 01:35:27,777
I dare you to shoot Olivia.

1551
01:35:27,779 --> 01:35:31,347
He wants me to shoot you.

1552
01:35:31,349 --> 01:35:33,150
You got to trust me, Markie.
Don't do it.

1553
01:35:33,152 --> 01:35:35,218
This is the only way
to save us both.

1554
01:35:35,220 --> 01:35:38,123
Okay. I trust you.

1555
01:35:41,227 --> 01:35:43,162
I won't do it.

1556
01:35:48,666 --> 01:35:50,267
No!

1557
01:35:53,572 --> 01:35:55,438
Dare complete, Calux.

1558
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:57,141
Your turn.

1559
01:35:57,143 --> 01:35:59,910
Truth or dare?

1560
01:35:59,912 --> 01:36:01,477
I'm not in this game.

1561
01:36:01,479 --> 01:36:03,146
No, once you're asked,
you're in.

1562
01:36:03,148 --> 01:36:04,780
Those are the rules, right?

1563
01:36:04,782 --> 01:36:06,682
So, truth or dare, asshole?

1564
01:36:06,684 --> 01:36:09,418
Truth.

1565
01:36:09,420 --> 01:36:13,323
How do we get out
of this game alive?

1566
01:36:15,426 --> 01:36:17,527
You can't.

1567
01:36:17,529 --> 01:36:20,364
Carter was the only one
who could stop this.

1568
01:36:20,366 --> 01:36:24,368
So now the game won't end
until all the players are dead.

1569
01:36:24,370 --> 01:36:26,770
And your turn's next.

1570
01:36:26,772 --> 01:36:31,508
Unless you find
some new friends to play with.

1571
01:36:31,510 --> 01:36:34,581
But that's not
gonna happen, is it?

1572
01:36:38,483 --> 01:36:41,384
- Your arm.
- I'm okay.

1573
01:36:41,386 --> 01:36:43,253
Well, did it work?

1574
01:36:43,255 --> 01:36:45,755
It's not over.

1575
01:36:45,757 --> 01:36:48,758
The game will never end,
not as long as we're alive.

1576
01:36:50,261 --> 01:36:52,862
What are you doing?

1577
01:36:52,864 --> 01:36:55,167
I'm choosing you.

1578
01:37:08,947 --> 01:37:11,582
<i>My friends and I
went on a trip to Mexico</i>

1579
01:37:11,584 --> 01:37:14,618
<i>for spring break.</i>

1580
01:37:14,620 --> 01:37:16,753
<i>We ended up in an old mission</i>

1581
01:37:16,755 --> 01:37:19,292
where we played a game
of Truth or Dare.

01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:26,230
We had no idea that we had
encountered an unspeakable evil

1583
01:37:26,232 --> 01:37:27,763
that wanted to play with us.

1584
01:37:27,765 --> 01:37:31,301
When we went home,
the game kept going.

1585
01:37:31,303 --> 01:37:33,339
It killed five of my friends.

1586
01:37:34,505 --> 01:37:35,871
The game is real.

1587
01:37:35,873 --> 01:37:37,708
Tell the truth, do the dare,

1588
01:37:37,710 --> 01:37:40,009
or you die;
refuse to play, you die.

1589
01:37:40,011 --> 01:37:44,880
It can happen anywhere,
and it can come from anyone.

1590
01:37:44,882 --> 01:37:47,618
I am so sorry,
but I have to ask you...

1591
01:37:47,620 --> 01:37:49,622
truth or dare?
