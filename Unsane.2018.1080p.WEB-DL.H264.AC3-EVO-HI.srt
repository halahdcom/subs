I love you in anything.</i>

I see you in blue,</i>

- <i>How's your boss?</i>
- He's great. I mean...

He has really high standards
and he's really demanding,

but when he says you got something
right, you know you got it right,

Do you know
the therapeutic index?

It's, um...

138

It's the ratio that measures
the blood concentration

of if a drug is toxic
or when it's effective.

The larger the therapeutic
index, the safer the drug.

141
00:12:41,117 --> 00:12:43,454
The smaller, the more dangerous.

for me sometime next week...

160
00:13:39,274 --> 00:13:40,808
Please have a seat,
Ms. Valentini.

161
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:43,511
Someone will be with you
shortly to discuss next steps.

162
00:13:43,513 --> 00:13:46,546
No, we just discussed
the next step, so...

163
00:13:46,548 --> 00:13:48,384
It should just
take a minute.

164
00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:51,388
Okay.

165
00:14:14,911 --> 00:14:16,711
- Sawyer Valentini?
- Yeah.

166
00:14:16,713 --> 00:14:18,679
I'm Dennis.
Please follow me.

167
00:14:18,681 --> 00:14:20,714
Wh... Look, I don't have
a lot of time.

168
00:14:20,716 --> 00:14:22,552
I should be back
at work, so...

169
00:14:51,947 --> 00:14:54,817
- What am I doing here?
- I need to look through your bag.

170
00:14:55,652 --> 00:14:57,218
Why?

171
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,886
Don't worry. You're not
being singled out.

172
00:14:58,888 --> 00:15:01,325
I look through everyone's bag.
It's procedure.

173
00:15:29,885 --> 00:15:31,819
Uh, excuse me.
That's my stuff.

174
00:15:31,821 --> 00:15:34,288
Good afternoon.
I'm Nurse Boles.

175
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:37,491
Can you strip down
to your underwear for me?

176
00:15:37,493 --> 00:15:40,461
Please. Take off your clothes
down to your underwear.

177
00:15:40,463 --> 00:15:42,697
And remove
all your jewelry.

178
00:15:42,699 --> 00:15:45,799
Do you understand?

179
00:15:45,801 --> 00:15:48,336
If you need help
removing your clothes...

180
00:15:48,338 --> 00:15:50,938
- What?
- To check for identifying marks.

181
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,341
Scars,
birthmarks, moles.

182
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,675
It's to protect you, the other
patients, and the hospital.

183
00:15:55,677 --> 00:15:57,812
Look, I'm not sure what's
happening here. I, uh...

184
00:15:57,814 --> 00:16:01,716
The nursing assessment includes
a head-to-toe skin examination.

185
00:16:01,718 --> 00:16:03,516
It's a hospital-wide
policy.

186
00:16:03,518 --> 00:16:05,519
There's nothing invasive
about it.

187
00:16:05,521 --> 00:16:08,425
Look, I have to go. I'm gonna
be late for work, so...

188
00:16:11,893 --> 00:16:15,328
- The door's locked.
- For your privacy.

189
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,798
I need you to take off your
clothes down to your underwear

190
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,236
and remove
all your jewelry.

191
00:16:23,306 --> 00:16:24,975
There's nothing wrong with me.

192
00:16:27,476 --> 00:16:30,544
I just needed to talk to someone,
and the counselor said that I...

193
00:16:30,546 --> 00:16:32,579
Did she tell you to do this?

194
00:16:32,581 --> 00:16:34,948
Miss Valentini, are you
refusing to cooperate?

195
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:37,718
What happens if I do?

196
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,420
It would be better for everyone,
but especially yourself,

197
00:16:40,422 --> 00:16:41,857
if you'd just do as I ask.

198
00:16:44,627 --> 00:16:46,430
Turn around.

199
00:16:50,932 --> 00:16:52,768
Lift your arms.

200
00:16:59,308 --> 00:17:00,977
That's all.
Put this on.

201
00:17:02,912 --> 00:17:05,413
Can I go now? I've done
everything that you asked.

202
00:17:05,415 --> 00:17:07,682
You're upset.

203
00:17:07,684 --> 00:17:09,817
Take these.

204
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:12,356
- Then I get to go?
- You'll feel better.

205
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:25,635
Follow me.

206
00:17:44,786 --> 00:17:46,886
There's been
some kind of mistake.

207
00:17:46,888 --> 00:17:49,456
Your name
is Sawyer Valentini.

208
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:51,392
You know that already.

209
00:17:51,394 --> 00:17:56,030
By signing this, you've consented to
voluntary commitment for 24 hours.

210
00:17:56,032 --> 00:17:59,700
No. The counselor said
the forms were routine.

211
00:17:59,702 --> 00:18:01,638
You signed it.

212
00:18:02,437 --> 00:18:03,639
Look...

213
00:18:04,807 --> 00:18:07,040
you're just
doing your job.

214
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:11,645
And you've been so considerate of
my feelings and my well-being.

215
00:18:11,647 --> 00:18:13,414
And you're right.

216
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,750
I signed those papers.

217
00:18:15,752 --> 00:18:18,522
I'm here by my own volition.
It's for my own good.

218
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:24,625
Can I ask, do you think
I could just make a phone call,

219
00:18:24,627 --> 00:18:26,827
just to let my family know
that I'm okay,

220
00:18:26,829 --> 00:18:28,628
let them know
where I am?

221
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,731
You get a phone call.
That's allowed.

222
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:33,032
You're so nice.

223
00:18:33,034 --> 00:18:35,101
You're saying you want
your phone call now?

224
00:18:35,103 --> 00:18:37,003
Yes. Yes, that is
what I'm saying.

225
00:18:37,005 --> 00:18:38,774
Oh, my God. It's like
you read my mind.

226
00:18:41,109 --> 00:18:43,080
(LINE HUMMING)

227
00:18:47,449 --> 00:18:50,951
Yes, hi.
My name is Sawyer Valentini.

228
00:18:50,953 --> 00:18:53,854
I am at Highland Creek
Behavioral Health Facility.

229
00:18:53,856 --> 00:18:56,490
I am being held here
against my will.

230
00:18:56,492 --> 00:18:59,426
Please send help.
Thank you.

231

(SLAMS RECEIVER ON CRADLE)

232
00:19:00,796 --> 00:19:02,996
I'll be out of here
in, like, 20 minutes.

233
00:19:02,998 --> 00:19:06,102
Do you know how many calls the
cops get like that every week?

234
00:19:07,602 --> 00:19:09,770
Those are from crazy people.

235
00:19:09,772 --> 00:19:11,605
Let's go back
to the ward.

236
00:19:11,607 --> 00:19:14,744
No, I'm not going anywhere
until the cops show up.

237
00:19:15,977 --> 00:19:18,745
Can...
Can you stop taking notes?

238
00:19:18,747 --> 00:19:20,816
I have rights.

239
00:19:23,051 --> 00:19:24,721
Don't make me ask again.

240
00:19:38,234 --> 00:19:40,470
Hi. Alison.

241
00:19:41,603 --> 00:19:43,105
How's your baby?

242
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,176
How's your baby?

243
00:19:47,709 --> 00:19:49,912
Alison. The baby.

244
00:19:51,013 --> 00:19:52,581

Oh, what?

248
00:20:10,832 --> 00:20:13,800
You think you're too good
to talk to me now, Alison?

249
00:20:13,802 --> 00:20:16,973
Oh, my name's not Alison, but, yeah,
yeah, I am too good to talk to you.

250
00:20:19,975 --> 00:20:21,841
Hey, bitch!

251
00:20:21,843 --> 00:20:26,012
Listen, when you fall asleep,
I'm gonna cut your hair off.

252
00:20:26,014 --> 00:20:27,815
All of your hair.

253
00:20:27,817 --> 00:20:29,215
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

254
00:20:29,217 --> 00:20:31,519
With what?

255
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:34,157
They let you anywhere near sharp objects?
I doubt that very much.

256
00:20:39,661 --> 00:20:43,263
Oh, God. You're scaring me to
death, you fucking mental patient.

in my own house, getting ready
to go to my own job.

260
00:20:50,106 --> 00:20:52,673
Calling her a mental patient
isn't helpful.

261
00:20:52,675 --> 00:20:54,575
We need to support each other.

262
00:20:54,577 --> 00:20:57,544
Yeah, well, support me by not
talking to me or looking at me.

263
00:20:57,546 --> 00:20:59,946
I shouldn't even be in here.

264
00:20:59,948 --> 00:21:02,081
Yeah, so, uh...

265
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,217
So you got put in here
by mistake, I'm guessing.

Yeah. Yeah. That's right.

267
00:21:05,888 --> 00:21:08,289
And the cops are on their way
right now to get me out.

- Really?
- (WOMAN LAUGHING)

- They said that?
- Yeah.

In those words,
specifically, to you?

can't have any.

- Expresso.

- No. I like just sugar. Lots of sugar.
- Hmm.

- Lots of sugar?
- Uh-huh.

Your coffee? Sucks.

He adopts strippers.

He adopts them?

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,311
There's been
some kind of mistake.

00:23:45,313 --> 00:23:47,313
Look...

322
00:23:47,315 --> 00:23:49,916
I'm not supposed
to be in here.

323
00:23:49,918 --> 00:23:53,453
- I'm locked up in here with fucking psycho rapists!

need to get out of here right now!

What the fuck was that?

We don't hit them back. She does
that again, she goes downstairs.

00:24:18,313 --> 00:24:21,181
No, I don't want...

Hi, Sawyer. Just coffee?
Nothing to eat?

Good summation.

00:25:47,403 --> 00:25:50,838
How was your night?
Are you settling in okay?

I'm not settling in anywhere.
I'm going home today.

to have a talk with him about that.

we're on the same page

it won't happen again.

Uh, you can see
I don't belong here.

You know there's been

That's our goal.

Good. So what can I do to give you
one less patient to worry about?

364
00:27:08,516 --> 00:27:11,084
Well, it says here that
you've been assessed

365
00:27:11,086 --> 00:27:13,386
as a danger to yourself
and to others.

366
00:27:13,388 --> 00:27:16,192
So that means
more observation.

367
00:27:17,292 --> 00:27:19,561
Doctor, look at me.

368
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:23,398
Look at me.

369
00:27:27,636 --> 00:27:31,570
Doctor, I have a wonderful
support system around me.

370
00:27:31,572 --> 00:27:34,574
I have family,
I have friends, coworkers.

I have neighbors.

372

The best thing for me is to be
surrounded by the people I love.

00:27:42,318 --> 00:27:44,283
Now, did I indicate
to the counselor

374
00:27:44,285 --> 00:27:48,422
that I sometimes,
occasionally, feel down?

Sure, I did.
But everybody does.

I'm building a new life
for myself, Doctor.

That's what's
gonna help me.

Uh, yeah.
But you see, um,

00:28:19,521 --> 00:28:24,092
it says here that you
assaulted a staff member.

387
00:28:26,094 --> 00:28:28,462
He looked like
someone I knew.

388
00:28:28,464 --> 00:28:31,330
Yes, but it says here
that you attacked him.

389
00:28:31,332 --> 00:28:35,001
I... No.
I was under a lot of stress.

were supposed to come.

391

And it says here that you
assaulted a male patient, Jacob.

392

No. He...

Okay, Hayley.
I'll take it from here.

go over the Highland Creek rules book.

What are your daily goals?

But I'm fine. I just needed
to talk to somebody.

Yeah, that's why Highland Creek
and all the other Highland Creeks

429
00:30:38,292 --> 00:30:40,393
and Tumbling Pines
and Cedar Valleys

430
00:30:40,395 --> 00:30:43,833
under the ADS Health
Enterprises umbrella exist.

431
00:30:45,701 --> 00:30:48,805
You talk, they find a way to
keep you and get you admitted.

432
00:30:49,905 --> 00:30:52,204
And you stay locked up

433
00:30:52,206 --> 00:30:55,274
until Aetna,
Blue Cross, Medicaid

434
00:30:55,276 --> 00:30:57,446
or whoever insures you
will pay.

you're cured.

- Business.

Highland Creek is just like any
other business in America.

439
00:31:09,925 --> 00:31:12,325
They got a number
to hit every month.

440
00:31:12,327 --> 00:31:15,628
They need to admit as many patients
to fill those beds to get that money.

441
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:18,298
You know,
the law of averages

442
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:22,801
suggests that a percentage of the
patients admitted to Highland Creek

443
00:31:22,803 --> 00:31:25,271
are in actual need
of psychiatric care.

444
00:31:25,273 --> 00:31:27,941
It also suggests
that a higher percentage...

445
00:31:27,943 --> 00:31:30,609
Are just like me.

446
00:31:30,611 --> 00:31:33,746
- They're locking up sane people for profit.
- Yeah.

447
00:31:33,748 --> 00:31:36,715
I'm here for seven days because
my insurance company approved it.

It's not that bad.

450
00:31:41,356 --> 00:31:46,259
I mean, it's inhuman, but compared
to where you could have landed?

453
00:31:51,199 --> 00:31:54,201
plus some less qualified
and motivated employees.

454
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:56,636
There's really
no comparison.

455
00:31:56,638 --> 00:32:00,339
And if you hook up
with the right people,

456
00:32:00,341 --> 00:32:03,909
you don't gotta worry
about weed, booze, porn,

457
00:32:03,911 --> 00:32:07,914
or whatever you use to make life
seem less of a crushing void.

458
00:32:07,916 --> 00:32:11,217
I, myself, am in the throes
of kicking an opioid addiction,

459
00:32:11,219 --> 00:32:14,386
so keep that shit
away from me.

Do your time.

Keep your head down.

like we're in prison.

You're welcome.

464
00:32:23,532 --> 00:32:25,432
Don't cause any scenes.

465
00:32:25,434 --> 00:32:27,867
Don't make any enemies.

466
00:32:27,869 --> 00:32:32,271
Find a community, learn how
to live with the routine.

467
00:32:32,273 --> 00:32:34,707
It'll be over
before you know it.

468

You've got any questions,
come find me.

No way.

00:33:37,305 --> 00:33:38,975
You can't be
anywhere near me.

475
00:33:42,543 --> 00:33:44,877
This won't work.

476
00:33:44,879 --> 00:33:48,647
The Boston cops have got a
record of the restraining order.

477
00:33:48,649 --> 00:33:50,517
I hope following me all
the way here was worth it

478
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:51,984
because you're going
to jail.

479
00:33:51,986 --> 00:33:53,855
- Move, Alison.
- No...

480
00:33:57,426 --> 00:33:59,895
George Shaw? Is that what
you're calling yourself?

481
00:34:00,995 --> 00:34:04,830
This man
is called David Strine.

482
00:34:04,832 --> 00:34:08,367
And he's been following me
and calling me and texting me

483
00:34:08,369 --> 00:34:11,804
and showing up at my job and
breaking into my fucking house.

484
00:34:11,806 --> 00:34:13,739
NURSE BOLES: Take
your meds and move on.

485
00:34:13,741 --> 00:34:17,344
No. I'm not going anywhere until
the cops haul his ass into jail.

486
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:20,713
George, did you do or say
anything to provoke the patient?

487
00:34:20,715 --> 00:34:22,849
Stop calling him that.
His name is David.

488
00:34:22,851 --> 00:34:25,354
He's followed me all the
way here from Boston.

489
00:34:26,455 --> 00:34:29,389
I've never
even been to Boston,

490
00:34:29,391 --> 00:34:30,989
though I am a Sox fan.

491
00:34:30,991 --> 00:34:33,425
You're a fucking liar!
I want my phone.

492
00:34:33,427 --> 00:34:35,362
I've saved all the text
messages you sent me,

493
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:36,762
all the really,
really sick ones.

494
00:34:36,764 --> 00:34:38,665
Do you remember, David?

495
00:34:38,667 --> 00:34:41,900
All the ones where you said you'd kill
yourself if you couldn't have me.

496
00:34:41,902 --> 00:34:44,837
- You're crazy.
- MAN: Maybe I should go back to the other ward.

497
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:47,373
I'm not doing
any good here.

498
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:50,543
No one is fucking
buying this, Strine.

499
00:34:50,545 --> 00:34:52,945
- It's George.
- No, I get it.

500
00:34:52,947 --> 00:34:56,750
It's not hard to get a job here. You don't need
qualifications. You don't need fucking training.

501
00:34:56,752 --> 00:35:00,887
I want my fucking phone call! I'm calling
the cops, and I want him arrested.

502
00:35:00,889 --> 00:35:03,389
Your phone privileges
have been suspended.

503

(MUFFLED SHOUTING)
No! I don't want to...

504
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,527
I don't want to be
in here with you!

505
00:35:07,529 --> 00:35:10,864
I fucking hate you!
I fucking hate you!

506

No, I'm telling you the
truth, I swear to God.

(GRUNTS)

514
00:35:39,795 --> 00:35:42,061
It's like you didn't listen
to a word I said.

515
00:35:42,063 --> 00:35:45,465
You keep this up, and you'll be spending the
rest of your time down in the basement.

516
00:35:45,467 --> 00:35:48,371
You said you wanted to help
me, so help me out of this.

517
00:35:49,703 --> 00:35:51,072
Good night.

518
00:36:02,884 --> 00:36:04,453
Uh...

519
00:36:06,822 --> 00:36:11,190
Yeah. Yeah, this story's gonna
be like the biggest story ever.

520
00:36:11,192 --> 00:36:14,494
Yeah, I've got evidence.
I got everything I need.

521
00:36:14,496 --> 00:36:17,230
Finally just going
to shut it down.

522
00:36:17,232 --> 00:36:20,402
Yeah, man. Yeah.

523

Sometimes she responds to me,
sometimes she doesn't.

527
00:36:48,163 --> 00:36:49,498
- Yeah.
- You know.

(CHATTERING CONTINUES)

529
00:36:55,703 --> 00:36:57,270
Hi.

530
00:36:57,272 --> 00:36:59,538
- What?
- Give it back, thief.

531
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,940
You took my last pack of cigarettes.
Where'd you put 'em?

532
00:37:01,942 --> 00:37:06,512
- Hide 'em in your snatch?
- I was in fucking restraints, you idiot!

533
00:37:06,514 --> 00:37:08,681
Oh! Fuck me!

Oh, well done,
Violet.

based on what it says here,</i>

<i>you are one incident away
from being sent to the basement.</i>

537
00:37:17,625 --> 00:37:20,592
Look, I was sexually assaulted.
Where's the outrage?

538
00:37:20,594 --> 00:37:23,695
Where's my advocate?
Who do I report this to?

539
00:37:23,697 --> 00:37:26,067
And what's in the basement?

540
00:37:27,902 --> 00:37:30,837
- What's in the basement?
- Solitary confinement.

541
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:33,672
Oh, my God. Send me there
right fucking now.

542
00:37:33,674 --> 00:37:35,608
My stalker... You've read
the counselor's notes.

543
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:37,911
You know who I'm talking about.
He's here.

544
00:37:37,913 --> 00:37:39,978
He's got himself a job
in the fucking hospital.

545
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,980
I talked to the second floor
about George.

546
00:37:41,982 --> 00:37:44,884
No, he's not called George.

547
00:37:44,886 --> 00:37:46,719
We did a thorough
background check.

548
00:37:46,721 --> 00:37:48,855
Yeah, you did a thorough
background check on George.

549
00:37:48,857 --> 00:37:51,324
I'm telling you, he isn't called George.
His name is David Strine.

550
00:37:51,326 --> 00:37:54,259
I'm trying to tell... You're not even listening
to me. I'm trying to tell you the man...

551
00:37:54,261 --> 00:37:57,699
And I'm adding a course of risperidone
and lithium to your meds.

552
00:37:58,833 --> 00:38:00,933
What's that for?

553
00:38:00,935 --> 00:38:03,235
To keep you
from hurting anyone else.

554
00:38:03,237 --> 00:38:05,137
And yourself.

555
00:38:05,139 --> 00:38:07,042
Are you serious?

556
00:38:08,143 --> 00:38:10,076
That's your diagnosis?

557
00:38:10,078 --> 00:38:12,210
You're sedating me
when I've just told you

558
00:38:12,212 --> 00:38:16,815
there's a predator who's followed
me here from another city.

559
00:38:16,817 --> 00:38:20,522
You should be protecting me.
What medication are you on?

if I said or did anything
to upset you.

Rain check
on the blow job?

626
00:43:07,942 --> 00:43:10,445
(LAUGHS) I wish I could go one
day without hearing that.

627
00:43:16,016 --> 00:43:19,053
I want to see my daughter!
Get her out here now!

628
00:43:20,455 --> 00:43:22,889
I'm not leaving, and I'm
only going to get louder,

629
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:24,523
so you probably
should do something!

630
00:43:24,525 --> 00:43:26,491
(PRESSING BUTTONS)

631
00:43:26,493 --> 00:43:29,061
She didn't know
what she was signing.

632
00:43:29,063 --> 00:43:32,197
I want her released immediately.
She's coming home with me.

633
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:35,134
Mrs. Valentini,
I understand your concern,

634
00:43:35,136 --> 00:43:38,036
but right now this is
the best place for Sawyer.

635
00:43:38,038 --> 00:43:41,944
Stuck in a hospital with her
stalker is the best place for her?

636
00:43:43,177 --> 00:43:44,479
Repeat that.

637
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,915
I think you need to talk
to Administration.

638
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:52,652
Highland Creek is a very ethical
organization, Mrs. Valentini.

639
00:43:52,654 --> 00:43:55,253
The decision regarding
Sawyer's admission

640
00:43:55,255 --> 00:43:57,623
was made by an attending
psychiatrist

641
00:43:57,625 --> 00:44:00,960
in consultation with members
of our clinical treatment team.

642
00:44:00,962 --> 00:44:02,661
Are you going
to release her?

643
00:44:02,663 --> 00:44:05,163
Sawyer is absolutely free
to leave

644
00:44:05,165 --> 00:44:08,934
once we're convinced that she no longer
poses a clear threat to herself and others.

645
00:44:08,936 --> 00:44:10,569
She doesn't.

646
00:44:10,571 --> 00:44:12,471
You only made her
think she does

647
00:44:12,473 --> 00:44:15,474
so you could describe her as
suicidal on your insurance claim.

648
00:44:15,476 --> 00:44:18,710
Let's focus

649
00:44:18,712 --> 00:44:23,049
on the positive work
we do here at Highland Creek.

650
00:44:23,051 --> 00:44:28,154
I have letters and e-mails
and phone messages,

651
00:44:28,156 --> 00:44:32,023
all attesting to the ways we've
turned patients' lives around.

652
00:44:32,025 --> 00:44:34,025
I'd be happy
to share some with you.

653
00:44:34,027 --> 00:44:36,962
- I'm calling a lawyer.
- You're quite within your rights.

654
00:44:36,964 --> 00:44:39,165
As am I
to contact our team.

655
00:44:39,167 --> 00:44:41,032
But...

656
00:44:41,034 --> 00:44:44,436
is that really
in Sawyer's best interests?

657
00:44:44,438 --> 00:44:46,038
No, seriously.

658
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:51,277
I'm concerned that coming off
as frivolously litigious

659
00:44:51,279 --> 00:44:54,079
might adversely affect Sawyer's
current employment situation.

660
00:44:54,081 --> 00:44:57,116
She hasn't been
in that job for long.

661
00:44:57,118 --> 00:45:01,023
And it might make potential
future employers apprehensive.

662
00:45:03,223 --> 00:45:05,192
Are we willing to risk
your daughter's future?

663
00:45:06,627 --> 00:45:08,661
Can I at least see her?

664
00:45:08,663 --> 00:45:12,398
I mean, if I could just see for
myself that she's all right.

665
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,000
This place does have
visiting hours, doesn't it?

666
00:45:15,002 --> 00:45:16,768
Could I at least
have one visit?

667
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:18,704
Of course.

668
00:45:18,706 --> 00:45:21,306
You've arrived just
at the end of visiting hours,

669
00:45:21,308 --> 00:45:24,278
but I can give you
20 minutes.

670
00:45:36,757 --> 00:45:39,157
(SIGHS)

671
00:45:39,159 --> 00:45:42,464
So this is what it takes to get
you to call and ask for help.

672
00:45:45,032 --> 00:45:47,266
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- (SCOFFS)

673
00:45:47,268 --> 00:45:50,369
- You don't have to apologize.
- Yes, I do.

674
00:45:50,371 --> 00:45:53,072
I should have told you
about all this.

675
00:45:53,074 --> 00:45:56,208
Should have told you about
Strine, the real reason I moved.

676
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:59,110
Is he here now? 'Cause I'll
haul him out of here myself.

677
00:45:59,112 --> 00:46:02,047
No. He works
the night shift.

678
00:46:02,049 --> 00:46:04,318
No visitors at night.
Stalker logic.

679
00:46:05,319 --> 00:46:08,253
I'm getting you out.

680
00:46:08,255 --> 00:46:12,358
That idiot doctor and that bitch
of an administrator can't stop me.

681
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,692
I'll go to the police,
to the FBI.

682
00:46:14,694 --> 00:46:17,395
I'll hire the most expensive
lawyer in the world.

683
00:46:17,397 --> 00:46:19,500
Whatever it takes, you're
coming home with me.

684
00:46:21,335 --> 00:46:22,835
Now, how are you
otherwise?

685
00:46:22,837 --> 00:46:25,170
You look tired.

686
00:46:25,172 --> 00:46:27,840
I'd love to just be tired.
(BREATHING SHAKILY)

687
00:46:27,842 --> 00:46:30,512
Mom, I'm scared.

688
00:46:31,813 --> 00:46:33,779
What else
can I do for you?

689
00:46:33,781 --> 00:46:37,215
What's with these clothes?
Unacceptable.

690
00:46:37,217 --> 00:46:39,617
They're probably not
even laundered properly.

691
00:46:39,619 --> 00:46:42,556
I'll bring you some of mine.
I always pack too much.

692
00:46:44,625 --> 00:46:46,391
Hey. Listen to me.

693
00:46:46,393 --> 00:46:48,527
I am getting you out.

694
00:46:48,529 --> 00:46:50,496
You are coming back home.

695
00:46:50,498 --> 00:46:54,369
And this man, this stalker
is done harassing you.

696
00:46:56,503 --> 00:46:58,373
I just need one thing
from you, Sawyer.

697
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:02,141
This.

698
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:04,045
You and me talking.

699
00:47:05,413 --> 00:47:08,346
Tell me the truth.

700
00:47:08,348 --> 00:47:11,349
No more walls. You've been
building walls since...

701
00:47:11,351 --> 00:47:12,686
Dad. Yeah.

702
00:47:15,857 --> 00:47:18,556
Yeah, that was hard,
but, uh, this is different, Mom.

703
00:47:18,558 --> 00:47:20,061
I promise.

704
00:47:21,328 --> 00:47:23,728
You're a tough kid.
You always have been.

705
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:27,599
But... I'm your mother.

706
00:47:27,601 --> 00:47:29,270
Let me help you.

707
00:47:30,804 --> 00:47:33,438
So, how do I
reach you in here?

708
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,708
Well, my phone privileges
have been suspended,

709
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:38,476
but that guy's phone
I called you from... Nate?

710
00:47:38,478 --> 00:47:40,913
Call him, and he'll find me.
Or I'll catch up with you.

711
00:47:40,915 --> 00:47:42,815
Where are you staying?

712
00:47:42,817 --> 00:47:46,451
I'm at the Lux Star Inn down
the road just two minutes.

713

I will mobilize
the troops

714
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:52,791
and I'll be back in a couple
of hours with fresh clothes

of cops and lawyers.

we could all lose our jobs.

780
00:51:38,853 --> 00:51:41,018
Nurse,
I won't let you down.

781
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:44,690
This... This job
means the world to me.

782
00:51:44,692 --> 00:51:47,925
I know. Your work
ethic is unreal.

783
00:51:47,927 --> 00:51:50,728
You're here day and night.
We could use more like you.

784
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:52,831
You're a gift from God,
George.

785
00:51:52,833 --> 00:51:56,971
Yeah. Just trying to make sure all these
folks get the help that they deserve.

786
00:51:58,139 --> 00:51:59,541
Hey.

787
00:52:01,942 --> 00:52:03,411
So, uh...

788
00:52:04,712 --> 00:52:07,679
I think
you broke the TV.

789
00:52:07,681 --> 00:52:08,983
No.

790
00:52:11,985 --> 00:52:13,788
God, I didn't mean to.

791
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:20,659
- I love TV.
- (CHUCKLES)

792
00:52:20,661 --> 00:52:23,195
- I must be insane.
- Oh, no, no.

793
00:52:23,197 --> 00:52:25,096
You're not insane.

794
00:52:25,098 --> 00:52:27,733
I know the difference between
people who are supposed to be here

795
00:52:27,735 --> 00:52:29,735
and the people
that end up here,

796
00:52:29,737 --> 00:52:31,703
and you're definitely
in column two.

797
00:52:31,705 --> 00:52:33,574
(SCOFFS) Oh.

798
00:52:35,543 --> 00:52:38,210
Oh, I feel like
I belong in column one.

799
00:52:38,212 --> 00:52:40,779
Ohh. What?

800
00:52:40,781 --> 00:52:42,780
Come on.

801
00:52:42,782 --> 00:52:44,853
You didn't think so
yesterday, so, uh,

802
00:52:45,886 --> 00:52:47,489
what changed?

803
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:52,724
What did you want to be
when you were a kid?

804
00:52:52,726 --> 00:52:53,858
- Me?
- Mm.

805
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:55,194
Shit!
(INHALES SHARPLY)

806
00:52:55,196 --> 00:52:57,061
I wanted to be
an astronaut.

807
00:52:57,063 --> 00:52:59,498
(LAUGHS)
Yep.

808
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:02,067
But, uh, I found out
that, you know,

809
00:53:02,069 --> 00:53:04,603
you had to deal with all
these numbers and shit,

810
00:53:04,605 --> 00:53:07,038
and, uh,
I'm trash at math, so...

811
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,842
(CLICKING TONGUE)
Didn't work out.

812
00:53:09,844 --> 00:53:12,945
- There's still time.
- Yeah. Sure there is.

813
00:53:12,947 --> 00:53:16,047
- Go to University of Phoenix, right? Maybe I'll do that.
- (LAUGHS)

814
00:53:16,049 --> 00:53:17,651
What about you?

815
00:53:18,886 --> 00:53:21,152
- It's too late for me.
- Nah.

816
00:53:21,154 --> 00:53:25,190
I was going to be
this renegade medical student

817
00:53:25,192 --> 00:53:27,592
who was able to
pinpoint diseases

818
00:53:27,594 --> 00:53:30,128
that all the old traditional
surgeons couldn't see.

819
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:31,762
- Oh, okay.
- Mm.

820
00:53:31,764 --> 00:53:35,666
It's a nice fantasy,
but I had no follow-through.

821
00:53:35,668 --> 00:53:37,869
I-I had... I mean,
I had the ambition,

822
00:53:37,871 --> 00:53:41,639
but I didn't have the drive
or the dedication to make it.

823
00:53:41,641 --> 00:53:44,009
- Oh.
- I couldn't even make it through pre-med.

824
00:53:44,011 --> 00:53:47,712
- Mmm.
- I had to switch majors when I was a junior.

825
00:53:47,714 --> 00:53:49,146
(CHUCKLES)

826
00:53:49,148 --> 00:53:52,217
But I still wanted
to do something, you know,

827
00:53:52,219 --> 00:53:54,286
so I volunteered
at a hospice.

828
00:53:54,288 --> 00:53:57,088
- Uh, well?
- Mmm.

829
00:53:57,090 --> 00:53:58,857
That's where
I met David Strine.

830
00:53:58,859 --> 00:54:00,992
"Most companies settle
with the government,

831
00:54:00,994 --> 00:54:04,096
but several area cases involving
more than two dozen power plants

832
00:54:04,098 --> 00:54:06,764
in the South and Midwest
are still pending.

833
00:54:06,766 --> 00:54:08,733
Remaining suits demand fines
for the past..."

834
00:54:08,735 --> 00:54:11,270
SAWYER:
<i>He was nice, you know?</i>

835
00:54:11,272 --> 00:54:13,674
<i>Quiet, uncomfortable.</i>

836
00:54:14,842 --> 00:54:16,741
<i>And I felt bad.</i>

837
00:54:16,743 --> 00:54:18,710
<i>I mean, how do you
spend two hours a week</i>

838
00:54:18,712 --> 00:54:22,116
<i>talking to your father
who doesn't even recognize you?</i>

839
00:54:24,817 --> 00:54:26,553
<i>My father died when I was 15.</i>

840
00:54:28,022 --> 00:54:30,855
- <i>Respiratory failure.</i>
- NATE: <i>I'm sorry.</i>

841
00:54:30,857 --> 00:54:32,259
<i>No one saw it coming.</i>

842
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:37,329
<i>So while I was fantasizing
about being the savior</i>

843
00:54:37,331 --> 00:54:39,834
<i>who would pull his father
back to clarity...</i>

844
00:54:41,601 --> 00:54:43,103
<i>David was having
his own fantasies.</i>

845
00:54:48,641 --> 00:54:50,777
He would want us
to be together.

846
00:55:02,623 --> 00:55:05,025
(NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

847
00:55:08,828 --> 00:55:09,730
(BUZZING)

848
00:56:17,431 --> 00:56:19,367
(SCRIBBLING)

849
00:56:29,842 --> 00:56:33,445
DETECTIVE: <i>Okay, let's
talk about Sawyer Valentini</i>

850
00:56:33,447 --> 00:56:35,380
<i>in Boston, year zero.</i>

851
00:56:35,382 --> 00:56:40,217
<i>Um, obviously I would recommend sensors
on all your doors and windows.</i>

852
00:56:40,219 --> 00:56:43,121
<i>I would swap the terrace doors
out for a steel-core door.</i>

853
00:56:43,123 --> 00:56:46,358
<i>Um, update your dead bolts.</i>

854
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:49,027
<i>Uh, I want to talk to you about
situational awareness, okay?</i>

855
00:56:49,029 --> 00:56:50,395
<i>Where's the nearest
police station?</i>

856
00:56:50,397 --> 00:56:52,264
<i>Where's the nearest
fire station?</i>

857
00:56:52,266 --> 00:56:55,000
<i>These are things that should always
be right on the tip of your tongue.</i>

858
00:56:55,002 --> 00:56:57,302
<i>Yeah, parking...
Um, I know you have parking</i>

859
00:56:57,304 --> 00:56:59,371
<i>in the rear of the building
with the back entrance.</i>

860
00:56:59,373 --> 00:57:01,172
<i>I'm gonna ask you
not to use that anymore.</i>

861
00:57:01,174 --> 00:57:03,175
<i>I know it's convenient,</i>

862
00:57:03,177 --> 00:57:06,143
<i>but I would advocate selling your
car and using a ride service.</i>

863
00:57:06,145 --> 00:57:10,081
<i>If you can't or won't do that, uh,
I would say park on the street,</i>

864
00:57:10,083 --> 00:57:12,050
preferably
under a light source.

865
00:57:12,052 --> 00:57:15,420
And come back and walk through this
courtyard here where people can see you.

866
00:57:15,422 --> 00:57:17,021
With your keys
in your hand, by the way.

867
00:57:17,023 --> 00:57:19,157
You want your keys
always in your hand.

868
00:57:19,159 --> 00:57:22,427
You don't want to be digging around in
your purse in the dark for your keys.

869
00:57:22,429 --> 00:57:25,730
Um, and I'll talk to you about
and help you with a go-bag.

870
00:57:25,732 --> 00:57:29,300
You know, just cash, credit
cards, uh, change of clothes,

871
00:57:29,302 --> 00:57:31,770
flashlight, charger,
that kind of thing.

872
00:57:31,772 --> 00:57:34,840
A firearm,
if you're open to that idea

873
00:57:34,842 --> 00:57:37,375
of purchasing or registering a
firearm and learning how to use it.

874
00:57:37,377 --> 00:57:39,744
Think about altering
your routine.

875
00:57:39,746 --> 00:57:42,880
Uh, when you go to work, when you
leave work, um, that kind of thing.

876
00:57:42,882 --> 00:57:46,083
How about social media? Are you
on any social media accounts?

877
00:57:46,085 --> 00:57:50,355
Uh, I'm on Facebook,
but my account's private, so...

878
00:57:50,357 --> 00:57:53,291
Right. Okay, that's no good,
because he'd be able

879
00:57:53,293 --> 00:57:58,029
to, you know, figure out a friend
of yours from marching band

880
00:57:58,031 --> 00:58:01,967
or a sorority sister
and go get photos from them,

881
00:58:01,969 --> 00:58:05,270
create a bogus account and then
try to friend you that way.

882
00:58:05,272 --> 00:58:07,773
Your friends know your e-mail.
Just... That's enough.

883
00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:10,007
Just delete the Facebook
today.

884
00:58:10,009 --> 00:58:12,210
Um, and then talk
to your friends, you know.

885
00:58:12,212 --> 00:58:15,313
Be open about this. Inform them what's
going on. Tell them not to mention you.

886
00:58:15,315 --> 00:58:17,415
Don't tag you on Instagram.

887
00:58:17,417 --> 00:58:19,951
You know, uh, um...

888
00:58:19,953 --> 00:58:23,788
You know, baby showers or, you know,
Chardonnay date with the girls.

889
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:26,056
You know, whatever it is, if
there's someone taking a picture,

890
00:58:26,058 --> 00:58:28,492
you do whatever you can
to get out of it, all right?

891
00:58:28,494 --> 00:58:31,563
And think of your cell phone
as your enemy.

892
00:58:31,565 --> 00:58:34,802
And this: your new best friend.

893
00:58:38,572 --> 00:58:39,974
SAWYER:
<i>And now he's here.</i>

894
00:58:43,377 --> 00:58:45,242
Or maybe it's all in my head.

895
00:58:45,244 --> 00:58:46,848
(CHUCKLES)

896
00:58:47,947 --> 00:58:49,350
Hey, come here.
Come here.

897
00:58:52,185 --> 00:58:54,354
- Hey.
- Hmm?

898
00:58:55,455 --> 00:58:57,355
Column two.

899
00:58:57,357 --> 00:59:00,291
- For life.
- (CHUCKLES)

900
00:59:00,293 --> 00:59:02,960
Give me some. Give me some now.
Come on.

901
00:59:02,962 --> 00:59:05,197
- Ahh, hey!
- Hey.

902
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:07,401
You've been to the hood
a couple times, huh?

903
00:59:20,547 --> 00:59:22,382
Sawyer.

904
00:59:24,418 --> 00:59:26,253
I'm sorry you've had
such a rough day.

905
00:59:41,101 --> 00:59:43,070
- Sweet dreams.
- Drop dead.

906
01:00:12,465 --> 01:00:14,498
SAWYER:
<i>I need to use your phone.</i>

907
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,300
(SIGHS)

908
01:00:16,302 --> 01:00:17,668
- Now!
- God, hey!

909
01:00:17,670 --> 01:00:20,005
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.
- I need to use it now.

910
01:00:20,007 --> 01:00:21,639
Okay.

911
01:00:21,641 --> 01:00:23,910
Geez, just keep
your voice down.

912
01:00:25,444 --> 01:00:28,048
- (WHISPERING) Everyone's fucking asleep.
- What?

913
01:00:30,016 --> 01:00:31,918
SAWYER: <i>Hi, can I have
Angela Valentini's room, please?</i>

914
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,188
Yep.

915
01:00:42,228 --> 01:00:45,697
Mom, hi, it's me.
I left a message on your cell.

916
01:00:45,699 --> 01:00:48,266
Can-Can you just give me
a ring back as soon as possible?

917
01:00:48,268 --> 01:00:50,137
Thanks.

918
01:00:56,076 --> 01:00:57,478
(WHISPERING)
Thank you.

919
01:00:59,378 --> 01:01:00,614
Hey.

920
01:01:11,692 --> 01:01:15,092
(NATE INHALING) Man, I don't even know
if she's telling the truth or not.

921
01:01:15,094 --> 01:01:19,063
I mean, some days she's normal, but
other days it's, like, I don't know.

922
01:01:19,065 --> 01:01:20,901
Maybe I just been in here
too long.

923
01:01:22,601 --> 01:01:25,235
Forget all that. Look, I need you
to check on something for me.

924
01:01:25,237 --> 01:01:27,274
And not because I like her.

925
01:01:45,391 --> 01:01:47,625
Get any calls last night?
This morning?

926
01:01:47,627 --> 01:01:50,695
No calls, no texts,
no voice mails.

927
01:01:50,697 --> 01:01:52,529
Shit.

928
01:01:52,531 --> 01:01:55,199
My mom didn't pick up
last night.

929
01:01:55,201 --> 01:01:57,404
Not her cell,
not her motel room.

Hey. What's this, like,
day five in here for you?

933
01:02:08,348 --> 01:02:10,614
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, focus on that.

934
01:02:10,616 --> 01:02:12,282
You've done
most your time.

935
01:02:12,284 --> 01:02:14,351
It's all downhill
from here.

936
01:02:14,353 --> 01:02:17,788
Just keep your head down
for a few more days.

937
01:02:17,790 --> 01:02:19,556
And you're free.

938
01:02:19,558 --> 01:02:22,427
And I promise you,
on that date,

939
01:02:22,429 --> 01:02:25,797
your mom will be standing
right there waiting for you.

- You're a good person.
- Ha!

01:02:32,038 --> 01:02:33,570
I do a decent
impression of one.

943
01:02:33,572 --> 01:02:35,507
Don't tell nobody,
all right?

01:02:35,509 --> 01:02:37,741
How long have you got
left in here?

948
01:02:49,623 --> 01:02:52,460
So, uh, I get out
a few days after you.

949
01:02:54,194 --> 01:02:55,427
- We should maybe...
- No!

01:02:55,429 --> 01:02:56,527
- No?
- No.

951
01:02:56,529 --> 01:02:58,762

be dramatically reduced.

You've been a friend to me.

956
01:03:09,708 --> 01:03:12,509
- And I'd like the opportunity to be one for you.
- Okay.

957
01:03:12,511 --> 01:03:15,212
- If you let me.
- Yeah.

958

Once you're free, you might have a
completely different perspective.

959

And I don't blame you.

960

But should
that not happen...

961
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:28,128
maybe you'll let me
use your phone.

how you and I met.

to have their ring.

I was there.

1089
01:12:02,642 --> 01:12:04,975
Yeah, well,
he was your father,

1090
01:12:04,977 --> 01:12:09,048
and you couldn't think of
two words to say to him.

1091
01:12:10,917 --> 01:12:13,350
You keep saying
that you love me,

1092
01:12:13,352 --> 01:12:15,685
but you're not capable
of loving anybody.

1093
01:12:15,687 --> 01:12:18,756
Not true.

1094
01:12:18,758 --> 01:12:22,659
Losing his mind was the best thing
that could have happened to him.

1095
01:12:22,661 --> 01:12:24,894
Do you think
he'd be proud of you?

1096
01:12:24,896 --> 01:12:27,398
How you've turned out?

1097
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:28,765
- Stop it.
- What?

1098
01:12:28,767 --> 01:12:30,835
What? Too mean?

1099
01:12:30,837 --> 01:12:32,369
Not the girl you love?

1100
01:12:32,371 --> 01:12:35,171
- You don't fucking know me!
- I do!

1101
01:12:35,173 --> 01:12:37,742
Well, then love me
like this, David.

1102
01:12:37,744 --> 01:12:40,277
Love me like this.
Love me when I'm a bitch.

1103
01:12:40,279 --> 01:12:44,681
Love me when I cheat. Love me when I
shut down. Love all the shit about me.

1104
01:12:44,683 --> 01:12:46,850
That's not you.

1105
01:12:46,852 --> 01:12:50,289
That's what trying to make yourself like
everybody else in the world has done to you.

1106
01:12:51,891 --> 01:12:53,192
Really?

1107
01:12:54,326 --> 01:12:56,329
You're a fucking simpleton.

1108
01:12:57,763 --> 01:12:59,363
Do you know that?

1109
01:12:59,365 --> 01:13:02,699
- You are a fucking dunce.
- Sawyer.

1110
01:13:02,701 --> 01:13:05,806
That sweet,
kind girl in your head?

1111
01:13:06,838 --> 01:13:08,140
That's not me.

1112
01:13:10,677 --> 01:13:12,312
Can I ask you a question,
David?

1113
01:13:14,446 --> 01:13:16,083
Who did this to you?

1114
01:13:17,784 --> 01:13:20,350
Who rejected you?

1115
01:13:20,352 --> 01:13:23,887
Did she let you
down easy? Huh?

1116
01:13:23,889 --> 01:13:26,957
"I'm flattered, David, but I don't
want to ruin our friendship."

1117
01:13:26,959 --> 01:13:29,025
She ghost you? Hmm?

1118
01:13:29,027 --> 01:13:30,860
- She block your number?
- Stop.

1119
01:13:30,862 --> 01:13:32,462
She unfriend you
on Facebook?

1120
01:13:32,464 --> 01:13:34,230
Vanish from your life?

1121
01:13:34,232 --> 01:13:36,966
Or was it worse?
(GASPS)

1122
01:13:36,968 --> 01:13:40,770
Did she look like she was
going to be sick? Hmm?

1123
01:13:40,772 --> 01:13:44,007
- Did she laugh in your face? Did she tell all her friends?
- It's not you.

1124
01:13:44,009 --> 01:13:46,810
No? 'Cause I'm telling you, David.
That's me.

1125
01:13:46,812 --> 01:13:49,079
That's what I would've done.
That's what I did.

1126
01:13:49,081 --> 01:13:52,116
That's who you love.
That's who you fucking dream of.

1127
01:13:52,118 --> 01:13:54,417
That's who you've been stalking
for the past two years!

1128
01:13:54,419 --> 01:13:57,354
Am I everything you'd
hoped I'd be, David? Hmm?

1129
01:13:57,356 --> 01:14:01,091
Is this what you imagine when you dream
of us living in your fucking cabin?

1130
01:14:01,093 --> 01:14:03,394
Two years!

1131
01:14:03,396 --> 01:14:05,162
- Two years, David.
- Shh!

1132
01:14:05,164 --> 01:14:07,064
- What a waste.
- You don't mean this.

1133
01:14:07,066 --> 01:14:10,333
What a fucking waste. You could've
met someone else in that time.

1134
01:14:10,335 --> 01:14:13,369
- You know? People are pretty pathetic.
- I love you.

1135
01:14:13,371 --> 01:14:17,207
Child-killers gets visits from
women who see the good in them.

1136
01:14:17,209 --> 01:14:20,510
Someone who loves a child-killer might
be able to see some good in you.

1137
01:14:20,512 --> 01:14:22,512
- (CRYING)
- Because no one else fucking could.

1138
01:14:22,514 --> 01:14:24,180
No one else could, David.

1139
01:14:24,182 --> 01:14:25,783
No one else...

1140
01:14:25,785 --> 01:14:28,051
(GASPING, CHOKING)

1141
01:14:28,053 --> 01:14:30,354
Do it. Fucking do it.
(GASPS)

1142
01:14:30,356 --> 01:14:32,288
(SHOUTS)

1143
01:14:32,290 --> 01:14:34,927
(GASPING)

1144
01:14:39,264 --> 01:14:41,034
(WHIMPERING)

1145
01:14:44,236 --> 01:14:45,771
Now I see, David.

1146
01:14:47,272 --> 01:14:49,208
Now I see how you love me.

1147
01:15:15,301 --> 01:15:16,937
Check this out.

1148
01:15:22,542 --> 01:15:24,244
Our friend Nate
was taking notes.

1149
01:15:26,012 --> 01:15:29,380
All the shady stuff
that happens down here.

1150
01:15:29,382 --> 01:15:31,849
He's gonna need
a bigger notebook.

1151
01:15:31,851 --> 01:15:33,487
Second floor
should see this.

1152
01:16:06,352 --> 01:16:07,988
(NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

1153
01:16:16,629 --> 01:16:18,865
(NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

1154
01:16:38,284 --> 01:16:41,420
Um, you did the right thing
bringing this to me.

1155
01:16:56,201 --> 01:16:57,904
Good morning.

1156
01:17:01,072 --> 01:17:02,209
I...

1157
01:17:04,209 --> 01:17:05,911
I brought you
breakfast.

1158
01:17:09,682 --> 01:17:12,082
It's your favorite.

1159
01:17:12,084 --> 01:17:15,956
Two egg, bacon and cheese biscuit,
hash browns, large coffee.

1160
01:17:17,389 --> 01:17:20,925
You ate that at your desk
every morning.

1161
01:17:20,927 --> 01:17:24,161
You telling me that just killed
what little appetite I had.

1162
01:17:24,163 --> 01:17:25,498
Yeah.

1163
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:29,469
Most important meal
of the day.

1164
01:17:57,562 --> 01:18:00,096
Thanks for this.

1165
01:18:00,098 --> 01:18:01,500
You're welcome.

1166
01:18:05,637 --> 01:18:07,640
I'm not used to people
being so considerate.

1167
01:18:10,676 --> 01:18:12,609
Most of the guys I know

1168
01:18:12,611 --> 01:18:18,084
would neither know nor remember
what I have for breakfast.

1169
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:21,120
I know everything
about you.

1170
01:18:22,387 --> 01:18:24,988
I know your favorite book.

1171
01:18:24,990 --> 01:18:27,291
It's <i>Pale Fire.</i>

1172
01:18:27,293 --> 01:18:30,760
Your favorite song, "Walking
After Midnight" by Patsy Cline.

1173
01:18:30,762 --> 01:18:32,395
Yeah.

1174
01:18:32,397 --> 01:18:34,400
My dad used to play it
around the house.

1175
01:18:36,267 --> 01:18:38,534
I know you want to go
to Portugal.

1176
01:18:38,536 --> 01:18:41,137
You had your favorite vacation
there when you were 12.

1177
01:18:41,139 --> 01:18:42,542
Okay, enough.

1178
01:18:45,143 --> 01:18:46,545
Maybe you do know me.

1179
01:18:59,525 --> 01:19:02,161
You know you can't keep me
down here indefinitely.

1180
01:19:03,762 --> 01:19:05,561
People are going to be
looking for me.

1181
01:19:05,563 --> 01:19:08,468
My mom, my job.

1182
01:19:09,768 --> 01:19:12,304
You could call your mom
from the cabin.

1183
01:19:14,272 --> 01:19:16,308
You really want to go back
to that job?

1184
01:19:18,110 --> 01:19:19,612
How are we going to live,
David?

1185
01:19:20,812 --> 01:19:22,147
You secretly rich?

1186
01:19:23,782 --> 01:19:28,118
There's this old diner
that's for sale, by the cabin.

1187
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:29,489
I was thinking
we could renovate it.

1188
01:19:31,624 --> 01:19:33,390
You've thought of everything.

1189
01:19:33,392 --> 01:19:35,658
I think of us
all the time.

1190
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:37,596
How are you going to explain
my absence from the ward?

1191
01:19:40,266 --> 01:19:43,169
I already changed
the duration of your stay.

1192
01:19:44,637 --> 01:19:46,670
As far as
the administration knows,

1193
01:19:46,672 --> 01:19:50,243
they think your insurance already
ran out and that you're gone.

1194
01:19:53,312 --> 01:19:55,615
There's a back door...

1195
01:19:57,215 --> 01:19:58,785
leads out to the woods.

1196
01:20:00,386 --> 01:20:02,088
We could go right now.

1197
01:20:03,722 --> 01:20:05,358
What if I say no?

1198
01:20:07,325 --> 01:20:09,094
What if I say let me go...

1199
01:20:10,629 --> 01:20:13,296
and we'll start over.

1200
01:20:13,298 --> 01:20:15,234
We'll go out for drinks,
get to know each other.

1201
01:20:17,268 --> 01:20:19,204
I'd lose you.

1202
01:20:21,139 --> 01:20:22,508
You know that.

1203
01:20:25,311 --> 01:20:28,380
You'd go back
to your old life.

1204
01:20:29,748 --> 01:20:31,747
And I-I don't fit there.

1205
01:20:31,749 --> 01:20:33,652
I only belong with you.

1206
01:20:39,491 --> 01:20:40,659
I know it's a lot.

1207
01:20:42,527 --> 01:20:43,663
It's not that, Da...

1208
01:20:45,630 --> 01:20:47,333
It's not only that.

1209
01:20:50,236 --> 01:20:51,838
God, I don't know
how to say this.

1210
01:20:53,405 --> 01:20:54,541
W-What?

1211
01:20:56,241 --> 01:20:58,311
Sawyer,
you can say anything.

1212
01:21:09,521 --> 01:21:10,789
Have you ever...

1213
01:21:13,859 --> 01:21:15,562
Have you ever been
with anyone else?

1214
01:21:18,297 --> 01:21:20,532
Beyond your feelings for me,
have you ever...

1215
01:21:22,433 --> 01:21:24,169
had sex with anyone?

1216
01:21:26,771 --> 01:21:29,542
I'm not judging.
I'm not. It's just...

1217
01:21:31,209 --> 01:21:33,346
Fantasy and reality
are two different things.

1218
01:21:35,213 --> 01:21:36,850
I might not be
what you want.

1219
01:21:38,717 --> 01:21:40,917
You're all I've ever wanted.

1220
01:21:40,919 --> 01:21:43,188
You've got nothing
to compare me to.

1221
01:21:45,191 --> 01:21:47,224
That makes no sense.

1222
01:21:47,226 --> 01:21:50,894
I need you to see
what you've been missing,

1223
01:21:50,896 --> 01:21:53,366
and then decide
if you still want me.

1224
01:21:55,834 --> 01:21:57,568
David,

1225
01:21:57,570 --> 01:22:00,537
I might be your last,

1226
01:22:00,539 --> 01:22:02,509
but I can't be your first.

1227
01:22:06,844 --> 01:22:08,878
Uh, n-no.

1228
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:11,814
No. No, sorry. No.

1229
01:22:11,816 --> 01:22:14,283
Well, you would
if you loved me.

1230
01:22:14,285 --> 01:22:15,985
You say all
the right things, David.

1231
01:22:15,987 --> 01:22:18,387
Or what you think
are the right things.

1232
01:22:18,389 --> 01:22:22,492
Greeting card clichés and romance
novel declarations of love.

1233
01:22:22,494 --> 01:22:24,827
But that's not love.

1234
01:22:24,829 --> 01:22:27,831
Love is giving yourself over
to what someone else wants

1235
01:22:27,833 --> 01:22:31,335
even if it goes against
everything you believe.

1236
01:22:31,337 --> 01:22:32,705
You say you love me.

1237
01:22:34,339 --> 01:22:35,607
Prove it.

1238
01:22:38,977 --> 01:22:41,246
How do I prove it?

1239
01:22:43,648 --> 01:22:45,250
You brought me down here.

1240
01:22:47,518 --> 01:22:48,922
Bring someone else down here.

1241
01:22:52,290 --> 01:22:55,727
Y-Y-You want me to...?

1242
01:22:57,362 --> 01:22:58,731
Fuck her in front of me.

1243
01:23:01,734 --> 01:23:03,436
I can't do that.

1244
