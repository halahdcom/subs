00:32:39,755 --> 00:32:41,191
You guys know each other?

502
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:43,327
Yeah.

503
00:32:46,629 --> 00:32:48,062
Look.

504
00:32:48,064 --> 00:32:51,568
Is there any way possible you can
give me a lift to Shelter Island?

505
00:32:52,602 --> 00:32:53,702
Yeah, I could do that.

506
00:32:53,704 --> 00:32:55,036
Oh, good. Awesome.

507
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:56,207
Ouch!

508
00:32:56,974 --> 00:32:58,176
[groans]

509
00:32:58,442 --> 00:32:59,241
What?

510
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:01,611
You detached so abruptly.

511
00:33:03,914 --> 00:33:07,315
So without ceremony
of any kind.

512
00:33:07,317 --> 00:33:08,482
I...

513
00:33:08,484 --> 00:33:09,684
I apologize.

514
00:33:09,686 --> 00:33:10,855
It's all right.

515
00:33:12,054 --> 00:33:13,390
Youth.

516
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,226
You enjoyed the show?

517
00:33:19,228 --> 00:33:23,098
Yeah. Yeah, man. You were...
You were incredible.

518
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,065
You're like a god.

519
00:33:24,067 --> 00:33:25,136
[exclaims]

520
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,371
I can't catch them.

521
00:33:32,042 --> 00:33:34,675
- You okay?
- Yeah.

522
00:33:34,677 --> 00:33:38,882
Just look at these glowy things
flying around my face.

523
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:43,821
Kale?

524
00:33:44,855 --> 00:33:45,790
Yeah?

525
00:33:46,822 --> 00:33:48,155
Did you have the punch?

526
00:33:48,157 --> 00:33:49,526
- [brakes screeching]
- [grunts]

527
00:33:49,993 --> 00:33:51,462
Ow! Fuck!

528
00:33:52,396 --> 00:33:54,128
[whispers] It's a fairy.

529
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:55,763
It's a fairy.

530
00:33:55,765 --> 00:33:56,833
It's not a fairy.

531
00:33:57,833 --> 00:33:59,233
The punch was spiked.

532
00:33:59,235 --> 00:34:01,405
It's a group of fairies.

533
00:34:02,438 --> 00:34:04,405
They're meeting
about something.

534
00:34:04,407 --> 00:34:07,277
No. They're not meeting.

535
00:34:09,446 --> 00:34:11,779
- Kale...
- No, it's what they're doing.

536
00:34:11,781 --> 00:34:13,181
Kale, no. What are you doing?

537
00:34:13,183 --> 00:34:15,150
Kale? Kale, get back on the...

538
00:34:15,152 --> 00:34:17,251
What are you doing?
No, Kale. Stop!

539
00:34:17,253 --> 00:34:19,688
Stop! Stop the car. Stop!

540
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:20,654
Kale, stop!

541
00:34:20,656 --> 00:34:22,459
Just stop, please, stop!

542
00:34:22,993 --> 00:34:24,161
Shh.

543
00:34:24,994 --> 00:34:26,527
Keep your voice down,

544
00:34:26,529 --> 00:34:29,232
or we won't be able to hear
the fairies' secrets.

545
00:34:30,467 --> 00:34:31,602
Okay.

546
00:34:34,071 --> 00:34:35,773
You're hallucinating.

547
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:40,507
So...

548
00:34:40,509 --> 00:34:43,244
you're just gonna
give me the keys.

549
00:34:43,246 --> 00:34:46,248
Ow! Ow! What the...

550
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,715
You're a muggle.

551
00:34:47,717 --> 00:34:48,949
A muggle?

552
00:34:48,951 --> 00:34:50,687
Like a Harry Potter muggle?

553
00:34:51,154 --> 00:34:52,456
Hey.

554
00:34:53,522 --> 00:34:54,591
Kale.

555
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:57,761
Kale, get back
in the car! Kale!

556
00:34:58,795 --> 00:34:59,793
Kale?

557
00:34:59,795 --> 00:35:01,096
Kale, get back in the car.

558
00:35:01,098 --> 00:35:02,730
Kale, where are you going?

559
00:35:02,732 --> 00:35:03,965
Kale, give me the keys.

560
00:35:03,967 --> 00:35:05,203
Give me the keys, Kale.

561
00:35:05,802 --> 00:35:07,438
Kale, no! Kale!

562
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:09,339
Wonderful.

563
00:35:10,072 --> 00:35:11,275
[Kale whistling]

564
00:35:11,708 --> 00:35:12,674
Kale?

565
00:35:12,676 --> 00:35:15,175
[Kale whispering]
Come here. It's okay.

566
00:35:15,177 --> 00:35:17,212
Shh. I'm friendly.

567
00:35:17,214 --> 00:35:18,416
Kale?

568
00:35:18,848 --> 00:35:20,181
Come here.

569
00:35:20,183 --> 00:35:21,851
[Kale whistling]

570
00:35:34,797 --> 00:35:35,899
Okay, then.

571
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:46,344
[leaves rustling]

572
00:36:16,772 --> 00:36:18,041
I go this way now.

573
00:36:19,909 --> 00:36:20,911
Okay.

574
00:36:22,779 --> 00:36:23,748
You wanna come?

575
00:36:24,181 --> 00:36:25,349
No.

576
00:36:34,623 --> 00:36:37,294
[instrumental music playing]

577
00:36:40,996 --> 00:36:42,732
[dogs barking]

578
00:36:50,373 --> 00:36:52,310
[bells chiming]

579
00:37:07,324 --> 00:37:09,224
That's a great
painting of you.

580
00:37:09,226 --> 00:37:10,494
It's not me.

581
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,994
[laughs] Right.

582
00:37:12,996 --> 00:37:13,931
Right what?

583
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:18,366
Okay.

584
00:37:18,368 --> 00:37:21,069
Um, could I use your phone?

585
00:37:21,071 --> 00:37:23,438
Sorry. It's a business line.

586
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,706
It'll only take a second.

587
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:27,675
I just...
I need to call a cab.

588
00:37:27,677 --> 00:37:31,545
I can't tie up the business
line with personal calls.

589
00:37:31,547 --> 00:37:35,518
What if I let everyone in here
make personal calls, hmm?

590
00:37:36,819 --> 00:37:38,319
Okay.

591
00:37:38,321 --> 00:37:40,056
Might I use your restroom?

592
00:37:40,723 --> 00:37:41,926
Customers only.

593
00:37:43,627 --> 00:37:45,762
I would like one scoop
of rum and raisin, please.

594
00:37:48,831 --> 00:37:50,134
Plain or sugar?

595
00:37:51,735 --> 00:37:52,703
Cup.

596
00:37:59,775 --> 00:38:01,946
Uh, where do you think
you're going?

597
00:38:02,411 --> 00:38:03,513
Bathroom.

598
00:38:04,447 --> 00:38:05,980
I have to ring you up first.

599
00:38:05,982 --> 00:38:09,719
You want me to wait and go in
the bathroom with my ice cream?

600
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:14,322
I have to ring you up first.

601
00:38:14,324 --> 00:38:15,493
Fine.

602
00:38:24,034 --> 00:38:25,199
Three seventy-nine.

603
00:38:25,201 --> 00:38:28,268
I just realized that I left
my wallet somewhere, okay?

604
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:29,837
So you're not gonna buy it?

605
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,141
Well, I guess not.

606
00:38:33,243 --> 00:38:34,541
What am I supposed
to do with this?

607
00:38:34,543 --> 00:38:35,742
It's melting.

608
00:38:35,744 --> 00:38:37,110
Excuse me?

609
00:38:37,112 --> 00:38:38,980
I scooped this for you.

610
00:38:38,982 --> 00:38:40,047
It's yours.

611
00:38:40,049 --> 00:38:42,452
I didn't even touch it.
Just put it back.

612
00:38:43,319 --> 00:38:44,719
Can I just put it back?

613
00:38:44,721 --> 00:38:46,788
- Sure, you can!
- Then who's gonna want it?

614
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:48,889
That'd be like eating
someone else's chewed gum.

615
00:38:48,891 --> 00:38:52,061
That's nothing like eating
someone else's chewed gum, sir.

616
00:38:55,065 --> 00:38:57,232
Mom!

617
00:38:57,234 --> 00:38:58,668
[woman] What is it, Donny?

618
00:38:59,969 --> 00:39:01,536
He said he wanted
to use the bathroom.

619
00:39:01,538 --> 00:39:03,204
I told him the bathroom
is only for paying customers.

620
00:39:03,206 --> 00:39:05,639
- Okay, slow down.
- But he said he's gonna buy ice cream.

621
00:39:05,641 --> 00:39:07,308
- But then he said he doesn't want it.
- Slow down.

622
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,909
But now, it's melting!

623
00:39:08,911 --> 00:39:10,915
- Donny...
- I don't know what to do!

624
00:39:11,348 --> 00:39:12,583
In the freezer.

625
00:39:13,817 --> 00:39:15,019
[exhales]

626
00:39:16,552 --> 00:39:18,018
You say you lost your wallet?

627
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:21,021
Look, I don't even care
about the ice cream.

628
00:39:21,023 --> 00:39:25,025
I just came in here to try and use
the phone so that I can call a cab,

629
00:39:25,027 --> 00:39:28,429
which is irrelevant now
because I don't have a wallet!

630
00:39:28,431 --> 00:39:30,030
Do you need the freezer too?

631
00:39:30,032 --> 00:39:31,101
No!

632
00:39:31,567 --> 00:39:32,869
I'm fine!

633
00:39:33,969 --> 00:39:37,304
So you wanted an ice cream
to make you happy?

634
00:39:37,306 --> 00:39:40,708
No, I only ordered
the ice cream

635
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:45,081
because otherwise Donny wouldn't let
me use the customers only bathroom.

636
00:39:46,148 --> 00:39:47,715
Donny, soft liquor.

637
00:39:47,717 --> 00:39:50,684
Now, you let this poor boy
who's had a difficult night

638
00:39:50,686 --> 00:39:52,623
go and use our potty.

639
00:39:54,456 --> 00:39:55,725
Thank you.

640
00:39:56,359 --> 00:39:57,627
[toilet flushing]

641
00:40:04,768 --> 00:40:06,634
Everything come out all right?

642
00:40:06,636 --> 00:40:08,873
From the speed of things,
it was number one.

643
00:40:10,272 --> 00:40:11,338
Yep.

644
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,675
Come join us for a treat.

645
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:15,876
Uh, no, I'd love to,
but I really gotta go.

646
00:40:15,878 --> 00:40:20,784
I thought Donny told you that our
facilities are for customers only.

647
00:40:21,518 --> 00:40:22,820
Join us.

648
00:40:25,188 --> 00:40:26,123
Great.

649
00:40:28,023 --> 00:40:29,025
Thank you.

650
00:40:33,395 --> 00:40:35,131
Here you go.

651
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:39,602
Aah.

652
00:40:40,904 --> 00:40:42,005
Aah.

653
00:40:45,174 --> 00:40:46,243
Mmm.

654
00:40:48,043 --> 00:40:49,078
Good, isn't it?

655
00:40:49,946 --> 00:40:51,045
Creamy.

656
00:40:51,047 --> 00:40:52,081
Mm-hmm.

657
00:40:53,183 --> 00:40:54,114
Take another.

658
00:40:54,116 --> 00:40:55,215
You know what?
I got this.

659
00:40:55,217 --> 00:40:56,918
Oh.

660
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,255
- If you don't mind.
- [chuckles]

661
00:41:01,857 --> 00:41:02,993
Mmm.

662
00:41:05,561 --> 00:41:07,063
You know what?
This was...

663
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:11,034
Mmm. This was great.
Thank you.

664
00:41:12,034 --> 00:41:13,603
Are you two friends?

665
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,572
Yeah. Yeah, we're friends.

666
00:41:18,574 --> 00:41:20,810
Guess you're in the gang now.

667
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:22,543
[chuckles]

668
00:41:22,545 --> 00:41:24,244
Donny doesn't have
many friends
