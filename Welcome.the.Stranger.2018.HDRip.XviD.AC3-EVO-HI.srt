00:56:07,254 --> 00:56:09,590
No, it's fine. Really.
I'm gonna leave.

331
00:56:11,892 --> 00:56:15,963
I mean, I'm not sure where I'm
gonna go, but I'll figure it out.

332
00:56:18,198 --> 00:56:22,468
Why don't you stay one more
night? Just one more night.

333
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:25,236
I've already told
her all about you.

334
00:56:25,238 --> 00:56:29,841
We'll get to know
one another.

335
00:56:29,843 --> 00:56:31,278
Why didn't you
tell me about her?

336
00:56:32,078 --> 00:56:33,412
Didn't I?

337
00:56:33,414 --> 00:56:35,580
- Don't try and make me feel crazy.
- I'm not.

338
00:56:35,582 --> 00:56:37,482
Yes, you are. You didn't
tell me about her.

339
00:56:37,484 --> 00:56:39,118
Why?

340
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,852
- I don't know. I don't trust you.
- Trust me to what?

341
00:56:40,854 --> 00:56:42,354
'Cause you'd do
something weird.

342
00:56:42,356 --> 00:56:44,059
You'd make fun of her,
you'd be mean to her.

343
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,127
Where'd you say you met?

344
00:56:48,129 --> 00:56:51,162
- Nearby. She was up here on a film.
- Mmm.

345
00:56:51,164 --> 00:56:54,935
- Didn't I tell you that?
- Stop saying that! You didn't tell me.

346
00:56:58,472 --> 00:57:00,272
Is she an actress?

347
00:57:00,274 --> 00:57:03,508
Yes. She was up
here on a film.

348
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:05,310
- Where?
- Los Angeles.

349
00:57:05,312 --> 00:57:06,611
You just said
here, Ethan.

350
00:57:06,613 --> 00:57:09,281
No, I meant that...

351
00:57:09,283 --> 00:57:12,450
We met here, but she just
got back from Los Angeles.

352
00:57:12,452 --> 00:57:13,819
- Hollywood?
- I don't know.

353
00:57:13,821 --> 00:57:16,324
- It's the same thing, isn't it?
- Sort of.

354
00:57:18,158 --> 00:57:20,026
What kind of name
is Misty, anyway?

355
00:57:20,028 --> 00:57:22,127
I don't know.

356
00:57:22,129 --> 00:57:25,031
Does she just mist about
from room to room,

357
00:57:25,033 --> 00:57:26,665
just being all misty and shit?

358
00:57:26,667 --> 00:57:29,167
- What's up with you?
- How long have you been dating?

359
00:57:29,169 --> 00:57:31,671
I don't know.
A few months.

360
00:57:31,673 --> 00:57:33,839
You sure seem confused
about your relationship.

361
00:57:33,841 --> 00:57:37,174
You're making me confused.

362
00:57:37,176 --> 00:57:41,515
Don't blame your weakness
on my strength.

363
00:57:44,318 --> 00:57:45,419
She's nice.

364
00:57:46,886 --> 00:57:49,187
I'm happy.

365
00:57:49,189 --> 00:57:51,425
Can't you be happy for me?

366
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:55,493
But I can stay
a few more nights?

367
00:57:55,495 --> 00:57:58,730
Yeah, I already
said that.

368
00:57:58,732 --> 00:58:01,734
I thought she picked me.
I'm very confused.

369
00:58:01,736 --> 00:58:03,405
- What are you talking about?
- Okay, fine.

370
00:58:04,405 --> 00:58:05,906
I'll stay, okay?

371
00:58:07,207 --> 00:58:08,707
Okay.

372
00:58:08,709 --> 00:58:10,841
Just another week
or so, though.

373
00:58:10,843 --> 00:58:12,880
I already said that's okay.

374
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:17,050
Okay. Okay.

375
00:58:53,419 --> 00:58:54,622
You wanna help?

376
00:58:57,925 --> 00:58:59,593
Sure.

377
00:59:05,098 --> 00:59:08,102
Why don't you
break up the lettuce?

378
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:18,579
I like your hair.

379
00:59:20,647 --> 00:59:22,416
Thanks.

380
00:59:30,758 --> 00:59:32,727
Mount St. Helens.

381
00:59:35,629 --> 00:59:37,462
What?

382
00:59:37,464 --> 00:59:39,631
My necklace.

383
00:59:39,633 --> 00:59:42,500
It's made with the minerals from
when Mount St. Helens erupted

384
00:59:42,502 --> 00:59:46,471
in Washington state
back in 1980.

385
00:59:46,473 --> 00:59:51,245
It's literally a piece of disaster.
I mean, can you imagine?

386
01:00:00,086 --> 01:00:01,722
Where were you
last night?

387
01:00:06,459 --> 01:00:08,162
Up there.

388
01:00:12,533 --> 01:00:16,004
On a red-eye.

389
01:00:34,488 --> 01:00:37,823
Why don't you go
set the table?

390
01:00:37,825 --> 01:00:39,527
We'll have lunch
outside, yeah?

391
01:00:44,897 --> 01:00:46,233
Sure.

392
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:55,109
(DOOR OPENS)

393
01:01:27,006 --> 01:01:28,540
Who were you
with before Ethan?

394
01:01:28,542 --> 01:01:29,841
- Alice.
- What?

395
01:01:29,843 --> 01:01:31,011
Come on.

396
01:01:32,213 --> 01:01:33,647
It's fine.

397
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:39,417
- No one, really.
- No one?

398
01:01:39,419 --> 01:01:43,488
No, I wasn't really
the boyfriend type.

399
01:01:43,490 --> 01:01:44,825
And then, I met Ethan.

400
01:01:47,995 --> 01:01:50,328
Do you have
your own place?

401
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:54,165
No, I travel a lot for work,
so, I just stay here.

402
01:01:54,167 --> 01:01:57,334
What about your stuff? Where
do you keep all your stuff?

403
01:01:57,336 --> 01:01:59,971
I don't really
have a lot of stuff.

404
01:01:59,973 --> 01:02:02,477
Can we just have a normal
fucking conversation, please?

405
01:02:05,278 --> 01:02:08,615
Did Ethan tell you
about what's happening?

406
01:02:12,819 --> 01:02:14,453
No.

407
01:02:14,455 --> 01:02:16,591
You sure you don't know
what I'm talking about?

408
01:02:18,392 --> 01:02:19,861
Yes.

409
01:02:31,305 --> 01:02:33,973
(WHISPERING)
Hey, stop acting weird.

410
01:02:33,975 --> 01:02:35,143
ALICE: Ethan.

411
01:02:36,008 --> 01:02:39,778
You're the same as me.

412
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:41,779
We need to stick together.

413
01:02:41,781 --> 01:02:44,816
ETHAN: You tore us apart.

414
01:02:44,818 --> 01:02:48,356
That's why
I'm back now, okay?

415
01:02:51,290 --> 01:02:54,660
She was awful to me, Misty.

416
01:02:54,662 --> 01:02:57,562
- Truly awful to me.
- Who?

417
01:02:57,564 --> 01:02:58,899
Mother.

418
01:03:02,068 --> 01:03:03,502
That's why I ran away.

419
01:03:03,504 --> 01:03:04,669
No, you ran away
because you...

420
01:03:04,671 --> 01:03:06,370
- Because what?
- Nothing.

421
01:03:06,372 --> 01:03:09,640
- What?
- Nothing.

422
01:03:09,642 --> 01:03:14,848
After I fucked her husband, she
just walked into the ocean.

423
01:03:17,017 --> 01:03:20,785
Just walked and kept walking until...
(IMITATES WAVES)

424
01:03:20,787 --> 01:03:23,757
The tide took her away.

425
01:03:28,896 --> 01:03:33,901
There's no proof.
They never found her body.

426
01:03:35,301 --> 01:03:39,073
She had a secret life.

427
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:55,346
ALICE: After everything
we just talked about,

428
01:04:55,348 --> 01:04:59,517
she's gonna sit
by the fucking pool.

429
01:04:59,519 --> 01:05:02,287
She has no stuff. She
grew up here and there.

430
01:05:02,289 --> 01:05:06,024
- She has no past.
- She told us her past.

431
01:05:06,026 --> 01:05:07,591
Where'd you meet her?

432
01:05:07,593 --> 01:05:10,729
- I told you. Up here, on the movie.
- Really?

433
01:05:10,731 --> 01:05:12,631
Why is that so weird?

434
01:05:12,633 --> 01:05:14,665
She got into my head,
then yours.

435
01:05:14,667 --> 01:05:18,102
What? I don't...
What do you mean?

436
01:05:18,104 --> 01:05:19,970
She lives here,

437
01:05:19,972 --> 01:05:23,408
yet, I don't see, or feel the
energy of another woman.

438
01:05:23,410 --> 01:05:26,011
I don't know why not.

439
01:05:26,013 --> 01:05:29,747
I don't understand. You're
acting like she has an agenda.

440
01:05:29,749 --> 01:05:33,453
No. She's the one
acting, Ethan.

441
01:05:36,490 --> 01:05:41,225
She picked me.
Now, she wants you.

442
01:05:41,227 --> 01:05:44,696
What are you
talking about?

443
01:05:44,698 --> 01:05:47,397
It's not fair.

444
01:05:47,399 --> 01:05:50,035
She's gonna
take you away.

445
01:05:50,037 --> 01:05:54,406
I'm not going anywhere.

446
01:05:54,408 --> 01:05:57,944
I'm really sorry
I tore things apart.

447
01:05:59,546 --> 01:06:00,712
Alice...

448
01:06:00,714 --> 01:06:03,084
- Sorry.
- Alice.

449
01:06:04,718 --> 01:06:08,890
That's all in
the past. Okay?

450
01:06:12,459 --> 01:06:15,096
We can move forward.

451
01:07:41,414 --> 01:07:43,483
Looks great on you.

452
01:07:55,162 --> 01:07:58,232
Sorry about earlier.

453
01:07:59,865 --> 01:08:01,968
It's all right.

454
01:08:03,604 --> 01:08:06,473
You don't think I'm terrible?

455
01:08:07,874 --> 01:08:11,311
Everybody makes mistakes.

456
01:08:16,350 --> 01:08:19,451
- What's Ethan's book about?
- I don't know.

457
01:08:19,453 --> 01:08:23,624
He's not going to show it
to me until it's finished.

458
01:08:27,794 --> 01:08:31,031
Are you in love, Misty?

459
01:08:31,832 --> 01:08:33,598
Yes.

460
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,500
Both of you?

461
01:08:35,502 --> 01:08:38,036
Well, I would assume.

462
01:08:38,038 --> 01:08:42,105
- That's funny.
- Why's that?

463
01:08:42,107 --> 01:08:46,376
I guess I didn't get
that vibe from him.

464
01:08:46,378 --> 01:08:49,179
Why? What did he say?

465
01:08:49,181 --> 01:08:51,816
Nothing. Just that
you were casual.

466
01:08:51,818 --> 01:08:53,251
He didn't exactly
use the word, "love,"

467
01:08:53,253 --> 01:08:55,152
but he was probably
just nervous to tell me.

468
01:08:55,154 --> 01:08:56,755
Love is a big word.

469
01:08:56,757 --> 01:08:59,894
Do you think
I'm a child, Alice?

470
01:09:03,396 --> 01:09:05,730
No.

471
01:09:05,732 --> 01:09:08,802
So, don't lie to me like one.

472
01:09:29,722 --> 01:09:30,790
Hey.

473
01:09:32,993 --> 01:09:35,196
Those are beautiful.

474
01:09:38,164 --> 01:09:39,132
Thanks.

475
01:09:49,342 --> 01:09:51,311
You gonna come with me?

476
01:09:57,918 --> 01:09:59,483
Where?

477
01:09:59,485 --> 01:10:02,756
Europe. The Geneva film,
remember?

478
01:10:04,557 --> 01:10:06,390
Come.

479
01:10:06,392 --> 01:10:09,227
Alice can stay here
and watch the house.

480
01:10:09,229 --> 01:10:11,129
She can't come with us?

481
01:10:11,131 --> 01:10:14,933
No, they won't
allow that.

482
01:10:14,935 --> 01:10:17,602
Who are they?

483
01:10:17,604 --> 01:10:19,772
The producers.

484
01:10:23,043 --> 01:10:26,143
It's okay to leave her behind.

485
01:10:26,145 --> 01:10:27,879
She's my sister.

486
01:10:27,881 --> 01:10:32,153
She's not good for you.
She makes you crazy.

487
01:10:34,788 --> 01:10:38,792
Let's just get
out of here. Okay?

488
01:10:43,931 --> 01:10:46,000
(SIGHS) Okay.

489
01:11:18,864 --> 01:11:22,367
ALICE: <i>She won't get in our way.

(BREATHING HEAVILY) Ethan.

655
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:19,812
ETHAN: What have we done?

656
01:24:45,504 --> 01:24:48,138
ETHAN: They'll take her away?

657
01:24:48,140 --> 01:24:51,610
ALICE: Yes.
They'll take her away.

658
01:25:01,419 --> 01:25:05,057
Oh, shit. I forgot.

659
01:25:37,756 --> 01:25:40,060
ALICE: What is it?

660
01:25:45,698 --> 01:25:48,267
ETHAN: It wasn't real.

661
01:25:52,571 --> 01:25:56,642
It's okay.
It doesn't matter.

662
01:26:03,783 --> 01:26:08,719
I don't think she ever
walked into the ocean.

663
01:26:08,721 --> 01:26:12,590
I think she just wanted
you out of her life forever.

664
01:26:12,592 --> 01:26:14,625
Oh, yeah?

665
01:26:14,627 --> 01:26:18,761
Is that what you think?

666
01:26:18,763 --> 01:26:23,735
- So, where'd she go?
- I don't know.

667
01:26:28,673 --> 01:26:33,145
Ethan, she came here
because she knew.

668
01:26:38,184 --> 01:26:41,620
They took her
to a better place.

669
01:26:47,059 --> 01:26:51,594
Then why don't you
go with her, huh?

670
01:26:51,596 --> 01:26:54,099
So I can be alone.

671
01:27:02,106 --> 01:27:03,909
Okay.
