Anna..

173
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:57,484
I'm gonna undo these
straps for you, okay?

174
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,521
It's okay.

175
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:04,524
Just gonna undo
these straps.

176
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:11,164
Like that.

177
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:15,902
It's okay.

178
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,209
There you go.

179
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:32,819
Where's Daddy?

180
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:37,657
Is he in the better place?

[music continues]

183
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,832
Good morning, everyone.

184
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:21,934
So the doctors
have told me

185
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:24,137
what a bright
young girl you are

186
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:26,906
and how well you've responded
over the past week

187
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,908
to all their crazy tests.

188
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,578
I bet you're just about ready
to get out of here, huh?

189
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:34,447
Well, we think you're
ready to move on too.

190
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:37,750
So the Belington House
is a wonderful place.

191
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:40,720
They have a wide variety of
special therapeutic programs

192
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:42,189
designed for girls
just like you

193
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:45,024
and it's a lot more fun
than a hospital.

194
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:48,495
Excuse me, I'm sorry to
interrupt, but I gotta say

195
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:50,430
locking her up again
doesn't really sound like

196
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,464
the right strategy here.

197
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:52,665
With all due respect,
sheriff

198
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:54,701
I think we can trust
Dr. Rooney's expertise.

199
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,869
We haven't even received
the DNA results yet.

200
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:58,147
It seems a little bit
premature...

201
00:18:58,171 --> 00:19:00,673
I was just explaining to our
patient, the Belington House...

202
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:02,309
I'm gonna go with her!

203
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:05,612
Well, uh..

204
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:08,415
We'll see about that.

until your DNA results
come in.

208
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:18,325

that we use to identify

that you might have.

[indistinct chatter]

Until then I'm gonna
be responsible for you.

212
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:31,904
You okay with that?

213
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,645
You don't like my driving?

214
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:42,382
We're going less than
20 miles an hour.

215

It's safe.

I mean,
not in, in general.

217

If, you know,
for example

if you're driving
under the influence,

so no need to worry
about that.

you about from the hospital.

Why is she wearing
my clothes?

246
00:21:46,573 --> 00:21:48,074
Because she's our guest

and because she needed
something to wear.

- Roger.
- You need any help with her?

508
00:46:29,387 --> 00:46:30,721
No, I'm fine,
thank you.

509
00:46:30,755 --> 00:46:32,257
Well, here's the thing.

510
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:33,658
Richard Fuller just called

511
00:46:33,691 --> 00:46:35,961
and his 18-year-old son
Lawrence

512
00:46:35,994 --> 00:46:39,464
was also at that party and
he didn't come home either.

513
00:46:42,567 --> 00:46:44,369
He was last seen
around 11:00 p.m.

514
00:46:44,402 --> 00:46:47,772
Tom and I asked the kids, but no
one seems to see him leave, so..

515
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,450
Well, I, I thought maybe
we should ask her.

516
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:51,742
I think you should let me
handle that.

517
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:11,796
Anna, you need
to talk to me.

518
00:47:14,265 --> 00:47:16,301
Anna,
you need to tell me

519
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:19,404
what happened
at that party last night.

520
00:47:19,437 --> 00:47:22,173
You don't wanna be painting
your nails right now.

521
00:47:22,207 --> 00:47:23,474
I'm trying to help you.

522
00:47:23,508 --> 00:47:25,643
- I can't help you if you won't talk to me.
- Ellen.

523
00:47:27,212 --> 00:47:29,847
What's going on?
Are you okay?

524
00:47:29,881 --> 00:47:32,483
Ray, what do you know
about Lawrence Fuller?

525
00:47:32,517 --> 00:47:34,552
You mean besides
being an asshole?

526
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:36,654
Well, that asshole
is missing.

527
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,856
You think that Anna has
something to do with this?

528
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:40,134
I... is that what's
going on here?

529
00:47:40,158 --> 00:47:41,802
I want her to tell me
where she was last night.

530
00:47:41,826 --> 00:47:43,494
- She won't talk.
- Ellen.

531
00:47:43,528 --> 00:47:45,072
- I need for you to tell me where you were last night.
- I think it would be better

532
00:47:45,096 --> 00:47:47,532
if I talk to her.
- Oh, you do? Yeah?

533
00:47:47,565 --> 00:47:49,700
- Yes, alone. Yeah.

534
00:47:49,734 --> 00:47:50,868
Thank you.

535
00:47:57,275 --> 00:48:00,611
Don't worry, I won't tell
her about the blood.

536
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:06,551
Anna, you can't do
stuff like this.

537
00:48:06,584 --> 00:48:08,619
How am I supposed
to protect you?

538
00:48:13,959 --> 00:48:15,460
Let me see.

539
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:31,809
Ellen!

Thought so.

You're looking
for the others... like you.

553
00:51:15,873 --> 00:51:19,810
I haven't seen one of
your kind in 16 years

since the last purge.

Yeah, I remember
that night.

I'll never forget it.

Men from the town said they
got every last one of them.

But that isn't
quite true, is it?

00:51:56,981 --> 00:51:59,550

No, we got 'em all.

wanna understand.

Before I got you,
I had a dog.

594
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:45,730
His name was Jasper.
Good dog.

595
00:57:45,763 --> 00:57:47,965
Always a bit of a rebel.

596
00:57:50,568 --> 00:57:54,371
But then after the night
I got you

597
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:58,242
Jasper got crazier
and crazier.

598
00:58:00,177 --> 00:58:03,213
And then finally
one day he snapped.

599
00:58:05,783 --> 00:58:08,653
So I had to send him
to the better place..

600
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:11,756
...you know.

601
00:58:16,927 --> 00:58:19,196
I swore an oath, Anna.

602
00:58:21,065 --> 00:58:23,467
That I would kill
the Wildlings.

603
00:58:25,636 --> 00:58:27,037
If I had been..

604
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:30,841
...half the true hunter
Jasper was

605
00:58:31,976 --> 00:58:34,912
there would be no Anna..

606
00:58:34,945 --> 00:58:37,715
...and Jasper would still
be at my side.

607
00:58:45,455 --> 00:58:47,892
There's a better place
for you.

Lift up your shirt.

609

Find the place..

610
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:13,150
...and put it in.

611
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:20,290
Now, push it in.
Push it all the way in.

612
00:59:20,324 --> 00:59:23,861
Daddy, why didn't
you tell me

613
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:25,830
that I'm a Wildling?

614
00:59:30,267 --> 00:59:32,369
I wanted to spare you.

615
00:59:34,038 --> 00:59:35,472
Why?

(needle drops)

Anna was a mistake..

I wanna help you,
but you can't honestly

think that we can just
