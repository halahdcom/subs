1
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:49,501
Kids, y'all need to get inside!

2
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,298
The wedding is about to start.

3
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,047
Good afternoon, Ms. Quinn.

4
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,593
I heard Liam's song
on the radio this morning.

5
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,639
Can you believe it? Our very own Liam,
right here in Saint, is on the radio.

6
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:58,931
I can believe it, Ellen.

7
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,724
Now let's get inside
and watch him marry our Josie.

8
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:01,892
Yes, ma'am.

9
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:05,472
Our Liam has quickly become
a bonafide country star.

10
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,102
- Hey, you mind handing those out?
- Yes, ma'am.

11
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,058
Thank you.
Good to see you.

12
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,368
Ladies, twelve minutes.

13
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,616
- Oh!
- Twelve minutes, Ms. Quinn?

14
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:24,040
All the Southern time
in the world, my dear.

15
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:28,040
I handpicked these this morning
for Josie.

16
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,747
Thank you.

17
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:32,423
<i>I swear, though,
if one more person</i>

18
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:36,048
asks me about her groom's
new hit song on the radio...

19
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,432
Ms. Boudreau, I'll be sending
some of the boys

20
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,555
to get you lovely ya-yas
to your seats.

21
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:44,931
<i>All right.</i>

22
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,979
- Let's put the veil on.
- Okay.

23
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,228
Bethany, isn't she beautiful?

24
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:53,153
- I love you so much.
- I love you, too.

25
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:56,276
- Oh, you're gonna make me cry.
- You're gonna make <i>me</i> cry!

26
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,826
Hey, hey, hey,
there's my little sister.

27
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,995
I didn't know you could
clean up like that.

28
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,289
- Oh! Jake!
- Just kidding!

29
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,868
So are you ready for your big brother
to walk you down the aisle?

30
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,419
Is it really time?

31
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,041
It's almost.

32
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,998
Ms. Quinn wants me
to walk Mom down first.

33
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,378
Hey, how you doing?
Are you ready for this?

34
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:16,459
I'm ready.

35
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,545
Ladies...

36
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,926
Good Lord, don't y'all
look ravishing today.

37
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:22,052
Oh!

38
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,678
I'm getting married!

39
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,642
Ladies. You guys look beautiful.

40
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:30,394
- Mason!
- Johnny.

41
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,603
Josie, you look absolutely amazing.

42
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,609
Thank you, Mason.

43
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,066
- Kiera.
- Yeah.

44
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,447
Can me and Johnny talk to you
outside for a minute, please?

45
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,995
Sure. Josie, I'll be right back.

46
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:48,541
Laura, can you just touch up her lipstick?
Just a little more color.

47
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:49,959
Absolutely.

48
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,462
Do you think everything's okay?

49
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,292
Oh, yeah, honey,
everything's fine.

50
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:00,003
This is your special day.

51
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,010
Go like this.

52
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:08,265
Perfect.

53
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,530
Kiera, what is it?

54
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,652
Is Liam okay?

55
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,238
Liam's fine.

56
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,112
He's fine, he's just...

57
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,456
he's not coming.

58
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,707
I'm sorry, Josie.

59
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,083
What?

60
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,624
<i>We're gonna be here for you.</i>

61
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,552
Yes, we're here for you, honey.

62
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,541
Hell yeah!

63
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,902
Whoo-hoo!

64
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,246
New Orleans, thank you!

65
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,290
Thank you. You guys are awesome.

66
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,463
Now, I'm gonna do one more song
for you all, if that's okay.

67
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,506
I love you, Liam!

68
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,328
Thank you.

69
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,581
Goodnight.

70
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,842
Liam! Liam! Liam!

71
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,761
Liam! Liam!

72
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,011
Liam! Liam! Liam! Liam!

73
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,137
Great, great, great show, man.

74
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,184
You slayed it, as usual.

75
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,513
Vodka. Here we go.

76
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,473
- You see that blonde in the front row?
- Already on it.

77
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,310
Jack's put her in a car
headed to the after party.

78
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,440
I'm not going to the after party, man.

79
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,897
Okay, now, Liam,
the head of the label's gonna be there.

80
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,779
I mean, everyone's real eager to hear
about these new tunes you been working on.

81
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:35,737
Just have a bottle of vodka
sent up to my room, and a steak.

82
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,662
- All right? I'm starving.
- All right.

83
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,866
Jimmy, he ain't going.
He ain't going.

84
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,121
Ain't nothing like a hometown crowd,
though, right? Am I right?

85
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:49,334
I'm not from here.
I'm a few towns over.

86
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,293
Not here at all.

87
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,095
All right. Oh.

88
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,548
I'll get your towel, then.
Okay, great.

89
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,133
All right, boys,
good job, good job.

90
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,278
Hey, Liam Page!

91
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:16,861
I have been trying to get you up
for hours, Liam Page.

92
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,322
Can you stop calling me
"Liam Page"?

93
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,373
You're up! You're up! You're up!

94
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,997
- You're up! You're up! You're up!
- Hey, what are you... That's...

95
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,454
- That's my cell phone.
- Oh, that's a cell phone?

96
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,039
Please, come on...

97
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,716
No, it's broken. You broke it!

98
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,418
Oh, hold on! Wait!

99
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,003
Where are you going, Liam Page?

100
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,589
Oh, my God! Holy!

101
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,847
Okay, well, call me!

102
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,816
Could you please tell me,
where's the nearest cell phone store?

103
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,229
Yes, uh, Mr. Page.

104
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,734
I'd be delighted to assist you.

105
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:56,659
It's, uh, on the edge of the quarter.
I'd be happy to call you a car.

106
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:59,078
Can you just tell me how far,

107
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,996
which direction, how many blocks?

108
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,165
Take a right on Royal,
and it's six blocks down on your left.

109
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,664
- Okay.
- Oh, my.

110
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,515
<i>Liam, where are your shoes?</i>

111
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,231
Hey.

112
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:31,402
I'll give anyone $10,000
if they can fix my phone.

113
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,946
- $10,000.
- Oh, my God...

114
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,819
Mr. Page, uh,

115
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,525
- $10,000. You mind if I...?
- Can you...

116
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:38,735
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

117
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:42,321
Well, perhaps, sir,
we can interest you in a newer model?

118
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,407
I don't, I don't want
a newer model, okay?

119
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:48,120
- I want that... that phone.
- Allow me to assist you, Mr. Page.

120
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,921
- On the house. I'm the store manager.
- Oh.

121
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,923
Jojo?

122
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,251
- Jojo.
- Huh?

123
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,132
Release the device, please.

124
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:58,429
Thank you.

125
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,848
Why don't you step into my office?
We'll have a little more privacy.

126
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:05,307
Okay, let's have a look here.

127
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:12,936
I'll tell you what,
these older boards are tricky.

128
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,863
So, I take it these messages
you need to get to,

129
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,611
they must be very important.

130
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,067
Yes, there's just one.

131
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,490
There's just one.

132
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,667
Just give me one second here.

133
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:33,664
All right, well it's not gonna
win any beauty contests,

134
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,590
but this should work just fine now.

135
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,214
It's fixed?

136
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,842
I'll give you some privacy
and you can check for yourself.

137
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,056
Okay.

138
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:50,640
<i>April 9th. One saved message.</i>

139
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:54,568
<i>Hi, Liam. It's me, Josie.</i>

140
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,925
<i>Country star Liam Page
was spotted earlier today</i>

141
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,001
<i>in the French Quarter.</i>

142
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,838
<i>He was running barefoot,
according to some witnesses.</i>

143
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,968
Doris, hold on. This might be him.

144
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:26,475
Yep, I got him.

145
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,274
I need an espresso.

146
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,029
Oh, espresso?

147
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,906
Okay. Okay.

148
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,283
How about basic outerwear, huh?

149
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,035
Like shoes?

150
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,366
Hmm?

151
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,123
That little jog of yours
is all over T.V.

152
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,205
Doris has called me, like, five times.

153
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,085
Publicists live for this stuff, Sam.

154
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,882
Record labels do not.

155
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,631
Not to mention everyone's wondering
when you're gonna stop messing around

156
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,179
and deliver these new songs
you owe them.

157
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:07,599
I'm just, I'm dealing with
some writer's block right now.

158
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,893
Dude, I'm telling you,

159
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,390
you can't keep putting them off.

160
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:12,813
All right, Sam...

161
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,607
We have a meeting set
with the label...

162
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,150
Hold on one second.

163
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:21,192
Oh, crap, it's Blake Shelton.
I gotta get this.

164
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,363
Should be fun.

165
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,816
Hey, Blake.
What's up, buddy?

166
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,448
<i>Terrible accident took place
on I-59 this morning.</i>

167
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:29,871
<i>27-year-old councilman
Mason Belmont of St. Augustine</i>

168
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,245
<i>was driving on his way
to a city meeting</i>

169
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,372
<i>at approximately 6:30 AM</i>

170
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,579
<i>when he was struck by a drunk driver.</i>

171
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:39,006
<i>That driver is said to be
in critical condition.</i>

172
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,459
<i>Unfortunately Belmont did not survive.</i>

173
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:45,171
<i>St. Augustine, known by locals
as simply "Saint,"</i>

174
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:48,474
<i>is holding an open vigil
at their church tomorrow.</i>

175
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,095
<i>This was the third incident this month...</i>

176
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,769
All right, buddy, we'll talk soon.
All right, thank you.

177
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,265
<i>Okay, Liam, as I was saying,</i>

178
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,942
we're gonna get this meeting,
it's gonna be... Where you going?

179
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,690
You're just gonna walk... Okay.

180
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,156
I guess you're just gonna go. Great.

181
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:06,325
Get some shoes!

182
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,507
<i>A rooftop?</i>

183
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,053
You kidding me right now, Liam?

184
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:33,477
We're supposed to be on a flight
to Denver in half an hour.

185
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:36,897
Jeez, look at you, man.

186
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,225
I'm gonna go get you
a clean shirt or something.

187
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,605
Just get in the car.

188
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,401
<i>Now some sad news to report,</i>

189
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,609
<i>the town of St. Augustine is mourning
the loss of one of their own today.</i>

190
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,569
<i>27-year-old Mason Belmont,</i>

191
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,279
<i>who was born and raised in St. Augustine,</i>

192
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,285
<i>was killed on Tuesday in a car crash.</i>

193
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,082
Hey, Pat,
can you turn that up?

194
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,126
<i>...laid to rest this afternoon.</i>

195
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:01,626
<i>A funeral service will be held
and St. Augustine Community Church.</i>

196
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:05,005
<i>Mason leaves behind his wife
and two young children.</i>

197
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,965
Hey.

198
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:10,423
I'll give you a thousand bucks
if you get me out of here right now.

199
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,802
Yes, sir, boss.

200
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,877
Hey, Pat, I think you should go.

201
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,958
And if you wanna keep your job,

202
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,964
I wouldn't tell anyone where I am.

203
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,012
You got it, boss.

204
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:51,214
All right.

205
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,826
We're late. Remember, when we get inside,
you give Miss Kiera a big hug...

206
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,081
Oh...

207
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,135
Excuse us.

208
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,692
Hey, sis. Is everything okay?

209
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:50,322
Liam's here.

210
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:53,108
- What?
- Here's here.

211
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:57,242
Turn in our Bibles to Psalms 34:18.

212
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:01,200
<i>"The Lord is close
to the broken-hearted,</i>

213
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,911
<i>and he saves those
who are crushed in spirit."</i>

214
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,255
I wish I had the answers
to help you understand

215
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,877
why Mason was taken from us.

216
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,176
To help me understand.

217
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,968
<i>I think about this church,
during times like this.</i>

218
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:18,425
<i>Here in this church,
I've baptized most of you,</i>

219
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,351
<i>married most of you,</i>

220
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:22,680
<i>baptized your children.</i>

221
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,639
<i>We rejoiced in the good times together</i>

222
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:27,442
<i>and we bonded together
during the hard times.</i>

223
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,771
So, while I wish I had the answers
as to why,

224
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,902
what I can tell you is this...

225
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,234
That it was here, inside this church,

226
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,945
that Mason Belmont
sat every Sunday morning,

227
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:41,248
<i>with his family,
with that big smile on his face.</i>

228
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,495
<i>How blessed were we to have had</i>

229
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,828
<i>the privilege of experiencing that smile</i>

230
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:49,415
<i>that Mason bestowed upon us
through the grace of God?</i>

231
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,098
Hey, Jake, could you
take Billy to the car, please?

232
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,934
Just leave him be, Jos.

233
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:13,443
Josie, come on.

234
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,284
I got you, little one.

235
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,058
Hey, Liam.

236
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,679
Oh, hey, Dad.

237
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,145
Okay.

238
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:29,564
Ugh.

239
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:42,493
Morning.

240
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,696
Mornin'.

241
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,708
<i>What time is it?</i>

242
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,585
It's half past 9:00...

243
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,499
you know, AM.

244
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:02,176
That tastes awful, Dad.

245
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:05,092
Really?

246
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:06,472
Well, it tastes pretty good to me.

247
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,053
Mm-mm.

248
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:12,600
Uh, make sure you
clean your cup out.

249
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,603
You know, with some soap and water.

250
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,406
You still know how to wash dishes,
don't you, Liam?

251
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:30,834
Right here.

252
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:45,932
<i>What happened to Mom's rose garden?</i>

253
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,519
I don't know.

254
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,811
I just couldn't keep up with it.

255
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,950
So, I'll be back around 6:00 tonight.

256
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,778
You... you're just
gonna leave right now?

257
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,740
Well, I'll make us some supper
when I get back.

258
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,621
You know, if you're still around.

259
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:13,576
Well, um,

260
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,663
I'm not sure how long
I'm gonna be here for.

261
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:16,837
So...

262
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,131
Right.

263
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,710
Do they have Uber here, or...

264
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,723
How... how else am I
supposed to get around, Dad?

265
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,217
I think your old bike
is still in the garage.

266
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,639
Get out of the pool.
Come on, let's go, let's go.

267
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:37,067
Have you completely lost
your flipping mind?

268
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:39,395
<i>I mean,
you've pulled a lot of crap on me,</i>

269
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,231
but you've never missed
and entire concert, Liam.

270
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,031
- I'm sorry.
<i>- You're sorry?</i>

271
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:46,201
That's good, that's good.

272
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:48,574
Babe, would you get the kids?
I just don't want them to hear this.

273
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,372
Liam, you missed the whole concert.

274
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,325
Okay? That's 20,000 fans,

275
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,957
and me, and Doris, and the label,

276
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,663
all wondering why Liam Page
isn't at the concert

277
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,841
his people paid good money
to see him play at.

278
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,509
I mean, do you have any idea
how much this costs the tour?

279
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:04,882
I'll pay them back.

280
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,430
Oh, you're gonna pay them back?
You'll pay them back.

281
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,929
Oh, man, you just don't get it,
do you, buddy?

282
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:12,136
Okay, do you know,
right now,

283
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:15,597
the whole world is wondering
where Liam Page is.

284
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,899
Yeah. Have you turned on a TV?

285
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:21,103
Does that prehistoric cell phone
of yours even have Wi-Fi?

286
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:22,904
<i>I'm in my home town right now.</i>

287
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,027
In Louisiana. My...

288
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,983
My best friend from high school
passed away.

289
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,864
<i>I just went to his funeral.</i>

290
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,457
<i>Liam, I am so sorry, man,
I mean,</i>

291
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,535
<i>- are you all right?</i>
- Yeah, I think so.

292
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:37,710
<i>Okay, well...</i>

293
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,880
I just want you to know I'm gonna
get everything settled on this end.

294
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,456
All right? I mean,

295
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,587
that was your last concert date
on that tour,

296
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,589
so we'll just set Denver up

297
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,261
after we go to Europe
on the next tour.

298
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:48,338
It's all gonna be fine.

299
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,640
<i>You just...
you just be with your friends,</i>

300
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:51,887
<i>and your family.</i>

301
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,094
And Doris? I mean,
Doris is already spinning

302
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:56,396
some crazy story
about why you missed that concert.

303
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,189
So don't you even
worry about it, all right?

304
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,813
Hey, Sam...

305
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:02,439
where are my credit cards?

306
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:04,778
Why?

307
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,403
I mean, I never seen you use
your credit cards by yourself before.

308
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,576
I... I just, I want...

309
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:12,120
to buy a few things, that's all.

310
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:13,993
<i>All I have is the cash in my pocket.</i>

311
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,075
Okay, all right.
Yeah, I'll overnight them.

312
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,284
Thanks, Sam.

313
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:19,540
Oh... can I get a car?

314
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,711
<i>Just text me your address.</i>

315
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:23,006
Speaking of crazy, there's Doris.

316
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:25,049
All right, I gotta go, brother.
All right? We'll talk soon.

317
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,344
Bike it is.

318
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,645
<i>$16.47.</i>

319
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:46,820
<i>All right.</i>

320
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,024
<i>20, and there you go.</i>

321
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:51,280
<i>- Thank you very much.
- Thank you, and have a good day.</i>

322
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,206
We have more in the back.

323
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:58,374
Excuse me?

324
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,873
More magazines
with your face on them.

325
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:03,080
Do you want me
to get those for you?

326
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:06,666
Nah, I'm good. Thanks.

327
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,467
Lydia.

328
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,420
We went to high school together.

329
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,423
Right.

330
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,639
$24.99, please.

331
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,346
So, Lydia,

332
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,524
you don't happen to know
where Josie lives, do you?

333
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:23,942
No.

334
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:25,644
Or where she works?

335
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:27,695
Thanks for shopping at Ed's.

336
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:04,274
Here you go.

337
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,693
That'll be $8.69, Mrs. Boudreau.

338
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,113
Oh, Judy, could you pop into the back
and get that arrangement

339
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:11,485
for Ms. LeBlanc for me?

340
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,191
She's gonna come by this afternoon
to pick it up.

341
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,651
- Sure.
- Thank you.

342
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:16,407
10...

343
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,952
20...

344
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,117
30...

345
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,455
40...

346
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:29,249
50...

347
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:31,884
- Hi.
- I'm with a customer.

348
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,303
60.

349
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:36,886
You know, this is such
a pretty prayer plant, Mrs. Boudreau.

350
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:38,808
I think you picked out
the best one I have.

351
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,430
Thank you, dear.

352
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:41,511
It's for Kiera.

353
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,722
That is so thoughtful of you.

354
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:46,308
I just adore truly thoughtful people.

355
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,567
7...

356
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:50,020
8.

357
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:51,525
Thank you, ma'am.

358
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,823
Now, why don't you let me
help you out to your car.

359
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,947
Hey there, Mr. Boudreau!

360
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,448
Hey, Josie!

361
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:00,030
Let me get that for you.

362
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:01,490
Thank you.

363
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,119
Now, you all have a nice day.

364
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,872
We sure will, dear.

365
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:06,744
Idiot.

366
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:19,512
That was quite a punch
you socked me with yesterday.

367
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,263
That was just a warning shot.

368
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,844
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

369
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,308
So, this is where you work?

370
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:27,015
I own it.

371
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:29,522
I bought it after Mrs. Quinn passed
five years ago.

372
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:30,977
Wow.

373
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,562
Yes, Liam,

374
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:35,899
I actually did something with my life
after you walked out on me.

375
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:37,359
And, yes,

376
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:40,116
a lot of people in this town have come
and gone since you were last here.

377
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:43,740
My mama passed away.
Do you even know about that?

378
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,284
No.

379
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,494
I'm so sorry.

380
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:49,375
I... I had no idea.

381
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,214
Have you noticed
that in the past eight years

382
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:54,293
no one, and I mean no one,

383
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,719
in this little town of ours
has ever spoken to the press

384
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,922
about you
or your life here, ever?

385
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:01,383
Have you also noticed that no one's
taken a picture of you,

386
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,594
posted it on Facebook,
Instagram, nothing?

387
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:06,555
And why do you
suppose that is, Liam?

388
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,435
'Cause I walked out on you.

389
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:11,359
Liam, it's because
you left us all that day.

390
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:13,311
The entire town.

391
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:18,157
No one's spoken about
what you did here because...

392
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,984
because we each other's backs
here in Saint.

393
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,445
We're a family.

394
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:23,905
We're loyal.

395
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,701
But you don't belong here
anymore, Liam.

396
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,420
Please, just leave.

397
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,174
<i>Hey, Mama!</i>

398
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:40,050
Hi, sweet pea!

399
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,632
Oh, my. Um...

400
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,433
How was your day at school?

401
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,354
You know, the usual. Nothing special.

402
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,725
Hello, Liam.

403
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:50,273
Laura.

404
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:51,440
You know what?

405
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:53,689
Laura's gonna take y'all out
for some cupcakes

406
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,145
at the diner, my treat.

407
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:57,105
Actually, it's on me.

408
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:58,360
Let's get going, okay?

409
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,817
I'm just gonna have some soup,
no cupcakes.

410
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:02,447
I don't want to spoil my dinner.

411
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,074
<i>That sounds nice.</i>

412
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,655
<i>Come on guys, let's go.</i>

413
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,741
Hey! I know you.

414
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:09,747
You were outside the church yesterday.

415
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:13,330
You're that country star my mama
listens to sometimes.

416
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:17,129
I mean, I just sometimes
have the radio on...

417
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:18,585
<i>Sometimes.</i>

418
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:21,387
Not really my cup of tea, no offense.

419
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,548
None taken.

420
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,392
I'm a...

421
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,470
I'm a friend of your mom's.

422
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:31,727
- Liam.
- Billy.

423
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:35,147
Billy?

424
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:38,647
<i>Wow.</i>

425
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,528
That's a...

426
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:43,993
That's a really pretty name.

427
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,571
Okay, sweet pea,
why don't you get going with Laura, okay?

428
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,406
<i>- And I will come up and meet you...</i>
- Just one little minute.

429
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:53,290
How old are you, Billy?

430
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,337
I'm... I'm really small for my age,

431
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:57,632
and I'm losing my baby teeth

432
00:27:57,718 --> 00:28:00,256
much later
than everyone else at my age.

433
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:04,180
I mean, they don't even have
the tiniest little wiggle yet.

434
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:05,677
But I'm seven.

435
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,134
Okay! Cupcake time, let's go.

436
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:11,141
Bye, Mama! Nice to meet you, Liam!

437
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,392
Bye, sweet pea!

438
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:13,848
Um, hey...

439
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:24,617
Seven, huh?

440
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:36,212
Well, I guess that conversation
I've played out a million times in my head

441
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:38,290
is actually about to really happen, huh?

442
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,792
Yeah.

443
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:43,886
Yeah, I think it is.

444
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:47,340
I'm gonna need a beer for this one.

445
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:15,664
I didn't find out that
I was pregnant

446
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,622
until a couple weeks
after our wedding day.

447
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:23,176
<i>What was supposed to be
our wedding day.</i>

448
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:29,428
I was so angry and humiliated
after you just walked out on me

449
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:31,009
and yet,

450
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:32,435
somehow,

451
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:35,104
I mustered up all
of the strength I had left...

452
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,895
I called to tell you I was pregnant.

453
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:44,068
<i>Of course, it went straight
to your voicemail.</i>

454
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:49,986
<i>I left you some long message</i>

455
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,322
begging you to call me back.

456
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,375
<i>And then I promised myself</i>

457
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,044
<i>that if you didn't have the decency
to call me back</i>

458
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:02,044
to find out what was so important
that I had to tell you...

459
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:07,512
I was never gonna contact you again.

460
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:11,599
Because Billy and I,
we deserve better.

461
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,813
You named her after my mom, Josie.

462
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:28,734
I did that for your dad, Liam.

463
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:33,072
She loves him so much.

464
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:34,952
We all do.

465
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:40,123
<i>Hey, sis?</i>

466
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,588
What are you doing here, Liam?

467
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,383
<i>Haven't you put her through enough
for one lifetime?</i>

468
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,881
Good to see you, too, Jake.

469
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:51,009
You know what?
Liam was just leaving, actually.

470
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,215
- Yeah?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

471
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:54,221
- I was... I was just leaving?
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

472
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,642
All right.

473
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:07,863
- Why didn't you tell me, Dad?
- Tell you what?

474
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:11,033
That I had a daughter!
Why didn't you tell me about Billy?

475
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,361
I did tell you.

476
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:16,823
When? What are you talking about?
We haven't even spoken since I left.

477
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:19,034
Yeah, exactly.

478
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:22,916
I went to your, uh,
your first concert there in Seattle.

479
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,963
You wouldn't return my calls,
so I, uh,

480
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,632
had to track you down
like some kind of fan.

481
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,459
Find out where you were performing.

482
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,886
- You were... you were at that show?
- Yup.

483
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:33,430
I even went backstage to see you after.

484
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:35,884
Had to plead
with one of the security guards

485
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,934
to let me in to see my own son.

486
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:40,354
And there... there you were.

487
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,807
You were so out of your mind
on God knows what.

488
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:46,144
I honestly thought I'd stumbled
into the wrong room.

489
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:49,447
But even after that,
I still tried to tell you about Billy.

490
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:53,117
That you had this amazing
daughter on the way.

491
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:56,453
I don't remember any of that.

492
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,954
Yeah, you don't?
Why don't I refresh your memory?

493
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,410
You told me to leave
and never come back,

494
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:04,666
although in much more
colorful language.

495
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,418
So what was I supposed to do, Liam?

496
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:08,044
You were... you were legally an adult.

497
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:11,966
I couldn't force you
to come home with me.

498
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:15,673
I was really messed up then, Dad.

499
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,350
Yeah, well, you really seem to have it
all together now, son.

500
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:19,427
So good for you.

501
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,891
You know what?

502
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:28,023
I just... I don't get it, Liam.

503
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:30,730
<i>You were such a good kid,
you were a great son,</i>

504
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:32,816
You were...
you were great to your friends,

505
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,741
and you were so in love with Josie.

506
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,077
What happened to you, Liam?

507
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:39,451
What happened?

508
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:42,833
I don't know.

509
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:45,957
Well, that guy I saw
in Seattle that night,

510
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:49,006
I knew that Billy and Josie
were just better off without him.

511
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:51,880
So, yeah...

512
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,420
Yeah, shame on me.

513
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,386
<i>Good morning, everyone.</i>

514
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,633
Um... well, you know,

515
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:43,060
It's been a rough time

516
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,557
here in Saint.

517
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:48,649
It's been a rough few weeks,

518
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,772
and, uh, it's got me
thinking a lot about,

519
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,945
about mercy,

520
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,693
and forgiveness.

521
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:56,570
<i>You know, scripture says,</i>

522
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:00,745
<i>"Forgiveness... for in love,
in all love,</i>

523
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,823
<i>we must have the capacity to forgive."</i>

524
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:06,705
<i>You know, to forgive, it sounds so...</i>

525
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:09,333
<i>easy, in theory, doesn't it?</i>

526
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:12,165
<i>And yet it remains so...</i>

527
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:15,047
<i>so profoundly difficult to achieve.</i>

528
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:18,801
<i>Trust me, I know.</i>

529
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,176
You know, here inside this church,

530
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:23,135
we've always practiced forgiveness,
haven't we?

531
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:26,016
So, with that in mind,

532
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:28,598
let's try today to...

533
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:30,809
<i>forgive those that have hurt us,</i>

534
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,985
<i>and to move forward.</i>

535
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,814
<i>And if we can truly forgive,</i>

536
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,524
<i>then we can truly be set free.</i>

537
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,405
<i>Let us pray.</i>

538
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,248
Liam?

539
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:54,711
I'm glad you're here.
Come on, stick around.

540
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,508
Pastor Page.

541
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,257
You remember Ms. Johnson?

542
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,055
Liam!

543
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:02,348
Thank you so much for coming.

544
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:03,766
Good to see you.

545
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:05,218
- Hey.
- Thank you so much.

546
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:07,053
See you at fellowship next weekend.

547
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,771
Thank you.

548
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,147
Hey, um, I'm so sorry.

549
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,728
Come here.

550
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:25,155
Let's go out this way.

551
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:06,703
<i>April 9th. One saved message.</i>

552
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:09,157
<i>Hi, Liam.</i>

553
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,583
<i>It's me, Josie.</i>

554
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,471
Dad?

555
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,422
Sweet.

556
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:24,448
Hi.

557
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,318
Hey.

558
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:31,656
I'd like to buy some flowers.

559
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,036
For Kiera.

560
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:36,498
Okay.

561
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:38,204
Hydrangeas are her favorite.

562
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:40,164
All right. Perfect.

563
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:43,001
I'll get... I'll get 24.

564
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,960
24?

565
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:47,300
Yes...

566
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,926
please.

567
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,136
Okay.

568
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,901
This is 12. Grab that.

569
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,690
Perfect.

570
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:07,821
Mm-hmm.

571
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:11,700
That will be $187.51.

572
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:14,498
Here. I got my own credit card.

573
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:17,327
Congratulations.

574
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,249
I wanna see Billy.

575
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,330
Sign here, please.

576
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:23,791
Look, don't ignore me.

577
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:26,719
I... I know that I haven't been a great...

578
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,341
anything, all right?

579
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,764
But I wanna get to know her.

580
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:33,684
I'm not gonna cause any trouble,

581
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,386
it can all be on your terms,

582
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,063
but she's my daughter too, Josie,

583
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,515
whether you like it or not.

584
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,905
Can I have a little time
to think about it?

585
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,327
Yeah.

586
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,826
Of course you can.

587
00:38:58,127 --> 00:38:59,117
Thank you.

588
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:01,249
Yeah.

589
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,455
Here.

590
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:05,833
Got a, uh...

591
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:07,213
You got a pen for me to sign?

592
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,136
You sign it with your finger, Liam.

593
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,882
Yeah, I knew that.

594
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,226
You need help with those?

595
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,519
No, I got 'em.

596
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:30,278
Eight is 32. I always try
to remember that one.

597
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,109
That's a really good one.

598
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,944
Do you want me to cut you a piece?

599
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:36,121
- Ready?
- Cheers!

600
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:39,200
Mmm!

601
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:40,455
Great, huh?

602
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:41,786
Mm-hmm.

603
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,792
So, sweetie, there is...

604
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:51,595
There's actually something
I want to talk to you about.

605
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:54,760
It's about your daddy.

606
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:59,888
I thought you never wanted
to talk about him.

607
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:01,688
I did not.

608
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,515
But that is not fair to you.

609
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,772
You have a right to know your father.

610
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:07,694
But that only is if you want to.

611
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:10,439
Because if you don't, that's okay, too.

612
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:13,150
I don't know, he seemed nice to me.

613
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:19,244
The guy from outside the church
and the flower shop, right?

614
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:22,327
You two weren't exactly subtle,
if you know what I mean.

615
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:24,128
Um...

616
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,001
How did you g...

617
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,925
Okay, um...

618
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:34,637
Yes.

619
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:39,059
Now, sweet pea, we met
when we were very, very young,

620
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:42,976
But it is important that you know
that he did not abandon you.

621
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:44,227
Okay?

622
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:46,434
He didn't even know that I was pregnant.

623
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:49,486
Yeah, he looked pretty shocked
when he saw me.

624
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:52,155
We should invite him over for dinner.

625
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,483
Might help him process the news.

626
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,279
Are you sure?

627
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:00,706
Yeah, I'm sure.

628
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:08,251
You amaze me, child.

629
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:13,340
Unh-uh! That's my blackberry!
Don't you dare eat that, Billy.

630
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:14,636
Billy!

631
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,679
- Okay, Maria?
<i>- Yes, ma'am.</i>

632
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:18,223
- Hey, try Liam.
<i>- Of course, ma'am.</i>

633
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,096
Please. Oh, and you know what?

634
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,302
Uh, hold that for a second.

635
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:23,228
Uh, I want a Cobb salad.

636
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:26,978
Uh, just, I want it with no chicken,
no tomato, no cheese, no corn.

637
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:28,184
You know, I'll call it in.

638
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:30,314
I'll call it in, because the last time
you messed it up,

639
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:32,067
and you... you got me something
with bananas.

640
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:41,447
- Yeah, hello?
<i>- Liam!</i>

641
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:42,782
It's late! Wake up.

642
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:45,367
Yeah, I am awake.

643
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:46,668
Who is this?

644
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:50,088
Hello, it's...
it's Doris Grossnickle-Heinz,

645
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,290
Your favorite lifeline.

646
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:53,967
- Oh, hey, Doris.
<i>- Hey.</i>

647
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:56,340
So guess where I have the paparazzi
thinking you are right now?

648
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:57,922
Uh...

649
00:41:58,016 --> 00:41:59,757
somewhere in the Caribbean, right?

650
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,101
<i>Yes! St. Barts at a rehab for exhaustion.</i>

651
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:05,395
<i>They are on a wild goose chase
as we speak.</i>

652
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,473
- Great.
<i>- So, listen, those Pap smears</i>

653
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:10,685
<i>can only run around that tiny little
island for so long without figuring out,</i>

654
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:13,566
even in their tiny brains,
that you are not there.

655
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:16,740
So, "L" I am, when am I
gonna tell the public

656
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:18,818
that you are out of that
sexy little rehab,

657
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:22,245
<i>because your fans
are chomping at the bit right now.</i>

658
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:24,698
I'm in my hometown right now, Doris.

659
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:28,540
An old friend of mine passed away.

660
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,038
Oh.

661
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:32,839
Oh, that's terrible.

662
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:36,043
Uh... I'm so sorry, Liam.

663
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:38,379
<i>But listen to me,
funerals are much better</i>

664
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:39,839
<i>than rehab for playing
the sympathy card,</i>

665
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,468
<i>so what I want you to do,</i>

666
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,721
is take as many selfies as you can
of yourself in the shower,

667
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,598
shirtless, bottomless, I don't care.

668
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,475
<i>In the coffin, by the coffin,
hugging the corpse.</i>

669
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,181
It doesn't...
just get these pictures in to me,

670
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:50,561
and I will get you
the cover of <i>People.</i>

671
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,187
Yeah, good bye, Doris.

672
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,985
Liam?

673
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:55,654
Did he just hang up on me?

674
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,149
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

675
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:02,660
It's not good.

676
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,413
Oh...

677
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:12,713
Hello?

678
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:14,916
<i>Uh, I need to buy something, Sam,</i>

679
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,500
<i>on the Internet.</i>

680
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:19,507
- You drunk?
<i>- No, I have not been drinking.</i>

681
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:23,181
Say, if I wanted to buy, uh,
an espresso machine.

682
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,054
<i>How would I...
how would I go about that, man?</i>

683
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:28,262
Okay, you Google it, you click "buy."

684
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:31,224
Oh, so it's that easy?

685
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:34,025
Okay, all right,
say if I wanted to buy, uh,

686
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:35,603
some... some jewelry,

687
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,780
or a... a teddy bear.
How would I do that?

688
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,404
Okay, what the heck's
going on down there, Liam?

689
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:43,486
I mean, you said you were gonna
be there for a few days, and...

690
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,161
Yeah, uh...

691
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:47,581
I think I might...

692
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:49,784
I might be staying
for a little longer.

693
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:53,666
Okay, great. So, how long
we talking about?

694
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:57,500
Turns out, uh,

695
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:00,381
I have a daughter.

696
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:03,179
What? Shoot, Liam!
With a groupie?

697
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:08,727
My ex-fiance from a long time ago.

698
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:11,055
<i>She's seven.</i>

699
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:13,357
And her name's Billy.

700
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,984
<i>Sam? You alive?</i>

701
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,154
Yeah, no, yeah, I'm...

702
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,856
I mean, wow.

703
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:22,907
<i>Liam Page...</i>

704
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:24,110
<i>is a dad.</i>

705
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,161
You think I'm gonna be terrible at it?

706
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:31,617
- Yah!
- No, no, no, no, no.

707
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:34,578
I think you'll be great.

708
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:55,265
<i>I remember these plates.</i>

709
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:59,065
Your mom
used to use them all the time.

710
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:01,272
You knew my mom's mom?

711
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:04,654
Yeah, I did. I, uh...

712
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:08,153
I used to come over here for dinner
all the time growing up.

713
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,826
He did, sweetie.

714
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:12,658
Back when this was my mama's house,

715
00:45:12,752 --> 00:45:14,960
Uncle Jake and I were growing up.

716
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:21,959
Like the bear?

717
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:24,465
It's very big.

718
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,801
I mean, you like teddy bears, right?

719
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:32,386
Yeah, when I was four.

720
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,062
Billy! Manners, please.

721
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:37,978
Thank you, Liam.

722
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:39,810
You don't mind me
calling you Liam, do you?

723
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:42,442
Since I don't know you well enough
to call you "Dad."

724
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:44,067
Billy Ann! What's gotten into you?

725
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,490
What? It's the truth.

726
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:48,444
I said I wanted to meet him,
but I never said I'd be easy on him.

727
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:49,994
She's got a point.

728
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:51,868
Yeah, "Liam" is fine.

729
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:53,199
"Liam" is fine, Billy.

730
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:57,039
Open your present, Mama.

731
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:20,358
I don't know what to say.

732
00:46:25,366 --> 00:46:27,198
May I be excused?

733
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:29,743
Um, of course you can, sweet pea.

734
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,954
Hey, Liam,
you wanna see my pet rabbit?

735
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,623
That sounds... that sounds like fun.

736
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:38,577
You know what?
I'll come with you, okay?

737
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:40,128
Mama, I'm all right.

738
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:42,501
You're not gonna kill me
or anything, are you?

739
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:43,798
<i>Billy Ann, that's enough!</i>

740
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:48,671
I'm just joking.
Come on.

741
00:46:58,566 --> 00:46:59,898
You're not seriously thinking about

742
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:01,725
letting that guy
back in your life, are you?

743
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:08,486
<i>Hello!</i>

744
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:11,284
<i>Yes, you are so cute.</i>

745
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:12,736
<i>You want some water?</i>

746
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,282
<i>Here she is.</i>

747
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:19,538
Yeah.

748
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:20,869
Here she is.

749
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,457
So, are you gonna

750
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,007
take her out of her cage?

751
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:27,550
No way!

752
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:30,174
She might bite me
or scratch my eyes out.

753
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:32,051
Well...

754
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:35,308
You mind if... if I take her out?

755
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,101
Okay.

756
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:40,807
But if she bites you,
you only have yourself to blame.

757
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:42,932
Okay.

758
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:50,282
Are you sure
you don't want to pet her?

759
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,867
I'm sure.

760
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:54,569
She's very soft.

761
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:58,495
So my mama played me
some more of your songs.

762
00:47:58,584 --> 00:47:59,791
Oh, yeah?

763
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:02,164
They're better than average, I thought.

764
00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:04,875
Thanks.

765
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:08,083
So I guess we should get to know
each other or something?

766
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:10,923
Yeah.

767
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:12,929
I'd like that.

768
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,221
Why don't you pick me up
after school tomorrow?

769
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:21,350
I would love that...

770
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,681
Billy.

771
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:26,485
That was terrible.

772
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,483
I was terrible. I mean,
I don't know how to do kids.

773
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,939
She hated that teddy bear,

774
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:32,899
just like you hated that necklace.

775
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:34,154
Liam...

776
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:36,532
Billy doesn't
need you to buy her things.

777
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:39,365
And I don't need you
to buy me anything either.

778
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:41,954
I can't accept this.

779
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:57,929
She's got your smile, you know.

780
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,598
Got your laugh, too.

781
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:02,429
You don't remember my laugh.

782
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:25,707
I can't do that part with you, Liam.

783
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,374
- Good night.
- No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait, wait.

784
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:33,256
Wait, she...

785
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:36,679
She asked me if I... if I could
pick her up from school tomorrow.

786
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,595
Liam...

787
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:41,847
This is moving way too fast.

788
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:43,303
You're gone for eight years,

789
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:44,933
and now you want to pick up
my daughter from school?

790
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:46,014
Our daughter!

791
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:49,188
I can't...

792
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:52,146
I have no right to ask for much
here at all.

793
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,355
I know that.

794
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:55,736
But I'm here now.

795
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:59,698
And I want to be here, Josie.

796
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:02,326
I want to get to know Billy.

797
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:03,657
Please, just...

798
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:06,038
just give me
the opportunity to do that.

799
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,872
- I'll beg.
- Okay.

800
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:12,377
Want me to beg?
I'll beg for you.

801
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:14,209
- I'll beg for you.
- Liam, stop. Get up.

802
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:19,214
Fine. Tomorrow...

803
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:22,551
meet me at 3:00 at the old benches.
We can pick her up together.

804
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:24,432
Thank you.

805
00:50:24,522 --> 00:50:25,888
Do not be late.

806
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,597
I won't... I won't be late.

807
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,683
I promise.

808
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:31,393
What time?
What time was it again?

809
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:33,274
Liam...

810
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:35,447
I know what time it is.

811
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:40,193
Well, fancy meeting you here.

812
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,277
Mm-hmm.

813
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:42,783
Can I help you with that?

814
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:43,989
Yup.

815
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,876
What is this?

816
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:50,750
It's a car seat.

817
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:53,711
You know, for a child
to ride in a car.

818
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:55,383
Never heard of it.

819
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,210
Oh, my God. Maybe this wasn't
such a good idea.

820
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:59,512
I know what a car seat is.

821
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:01,885
Come on, give me a little credit.

822
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:04,434
Okay, so she's gonna be
coming out of these doors right here.

823
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:08,431
Wow. Same doors
we used to come out of.

824
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:13,522
Oh...

825
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:17,025
- Aw, man.
- Need to get that?

826
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:20,530
No. No, it's my publicist.

827
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,202
Is that the same phone
you've had since high school?

828
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:29,371
Uh...

829
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,913
I don't... I don't think so, no.

830
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:35,670
- I remember it.
- Uh...

831
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:38,255
I...

832
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:40,837
No, it's... I don't think it is.

833
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,797
It has an antenna, Liam.

834
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:46,092
I mean, I just...
I like the phone, okay?

835
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,053
Okay.

836
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:51,518
- Oh...
- Ooh.

837
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,727
Oh, it's Kiera.
I have to take this. I'm sorry.

838
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:57,312
Hey.

839
00:51:57,406 --> 00:51:59,489
Oh, no, no, no.
Sweetie, don't cry.

840
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:03,151
You know what, I'm at Wilmington,
but I can be there in ten minutes.

841
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:04,281
Is that okay?

842
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:05,737
I'm gonna call you
from the car, Kiera.

843
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:07,697
I'll be right there.

844
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,999
She's having a really rough time.

845
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:11,576
Uh...

846
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,457
So, you're going?
You're going right now.

847
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:16,460
Yeah. I mean, unless you don't think
you can handle this alone.

848
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,712
I'm... I'll just take her in the car...

849
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:21,260
Okay, I'm gonna call Laura.
She's picking up her kids anyway.

850
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:23,555
- It's no problem for her to...
- No, no, no, no.

851
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:26,384
I'm sorry. Look, I, uh...

852
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:28,890
My dad's house is, like,
two minutes from here.

853
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,561
I think I'll be... I'll be all right.

854
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:32,310
- Okay.
- Yeah?

855
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:33,640
Okay, um...

856
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:35,566
Billy knows
how to put that in the car.

857
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:37,269
Okay, that's lucky.

858
00:52:37,363 --> 00:52:39,150
So just pay attention
to what she says.

859
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:42,107
Um... you call me the moment
y'all get home.

860
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:43,988
- Okay?
- Yeah.

861
00:52:44,078 --> 00:52:45,694
Tell her I love her!

862
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,866
Oh, man.

863
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:02,293
Jumping in the deep end, huh?

864
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:04,471
- Yeah.
- Car seat and all.

865
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:06,297
- Yup.
- Where's your car?

866
00:53:06,392 --> 00:53:08,850
Uh... right here.

867
00:53:13,649 --> 00:53:15,390
That's your car?

868
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:16,816
<i>Yeah.</i>

869
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:18,768
What's wrong with it?

870
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,524
I don't do convertibles.

871
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:22,526
They're too dangerous.

872
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:26,784
Come on, it'll be fun, no?

873
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:31,331
Do you know the stats on surviving
an accident in a convertible?

874
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:34,743
No, no, I do not.

875
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:36,499
Well they are low, Liam.

876
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:38,250
Staggeringly low.

877
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,923
Do you want to know
exactly how low?

878
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:43,171
You know what? I'm all right.

879
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:45,254
Um...

880
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:51,934
What about Grampy's car?

881
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,854
Maybe... do you like his car?
Is his car okay?

882
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,772
- Yeah.
- Yeah? All right.

883
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:01,106
Do you know Grampy's...
Do you know his number?

884
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:02,528
Now?

885
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:04,321
Yeah, on the count of three.

886
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:05,694
One, two...

887
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,525
Hold on, hold on. Be careful now.

888
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:09,986
And... three.

889
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,491
Smells good, doesn't it?

890
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:13,289
- Can I stir?
- Yeah.

891
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:19,670
You're gonna ruin your dinner
with that, you know.

892
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,881
Well, sometimes...

893
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:25,381
you just gotta let go,
take a walk on the wild side.

894
00:54:25,471 --> 00:54:27,554
Trust that everything's gonna be okay.

895
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:32,801
Is that chocolate chocolate chip?

896
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:35,057
Mm-hmm.

897
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:38,431
I mean, that's the only flavor
that matters.

898
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:40,016
You want some?

899
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,147
It's pretty good.

900
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:43,398
Hmm?

901
00:54:43,489 --> 00:54:44,821
Grampy, is it okay?

902
00:54:44,907 --> 00:54:47,240
Um... yeah. Half a scoop.

903
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:48,988
All right? Don't ruin your supper.

904
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,824
You wanna do it? Okay.

905
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:57,041
There we go. All right. Now we're living.

906
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,789
Yeah, look at that, that's a mountain.

907
00:54:58,879 --> 00:55:00,495
Wow, okay.

908
00:55:00,589 --> 00:55:02,205
All right, one big, big bite.

909
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:03,881
Who can take the biggest bite?

910
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:05,174
One, two, three...

911
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:08,636
Whoa!

912
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,179
That's a big bite.

913
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:11,631
Uh-oh.

914
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:14,263
Guess what, brain freeze?

915
00:55:14,353 --> 00:55:16,640
<i>- Brain freeze! Brian freeze!
- No!</i>

916
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,722
Maybe this wasn't
such a good idea after all.

917
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:20,648
Yeah.

918
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:22,771
One sec.

919
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:26,945
- What?
- It's gonna ruin her supper!

920
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:28,523
You should have seen her face, Dad.

921
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:30,324
You should see all this gumbo.

922
00:55:33,831 --> 00:55:35,663
Is this yours?

923
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:38,116
I found it in Grampy's closet
a while back.

924
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:40,042
Yeah. Wow.

925
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:46,170
I have not seen you
for a long time.

926
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,673
How do you come up
with songs to play?

927
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,503
Well, truth is,

928
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:52,884
I have not been very good at it lately.

929
00:55:52,975 --> 00:55:54,216
But don't tell anyone.

930
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:56,722
Well, just start playing.
See what happens.

931
00:55:56,812 --> 00:55:58,895
Okay, uh, all right,

932
00:55:58,981 --> 00:56:00,222
smarty-pants.

933
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:03,058
Uh... what do you want me
to write a song about?

934
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:08,438
Something about...

935
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:10,774
Right now, here with us.

936
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:12,404
Okay.

937
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:14,110
Um...

938
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,911
Right now...

939
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:19,032
Here with us...

940
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:20,958
Uh...

941
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:24,079
Let's... let's just start
with the melody,

942
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:25,333
shall we?

943
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:43,064
That's nice.

944
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:44,732
I like that.

945
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:06,333
Who taught you to play
the guitar like that?

946
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:09,006
Uh, well, my mom.

947
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,549
My mama did,

948
00:57:10,636 --> 00:57:13,049
when I was a little older
than you, actually.

949
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:21,936
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

950
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:24,355
Uh, you all right there?

951
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,433
Yeah, grab that towel there.

952
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:30,110
- Get this outside.
- It is pretty heavy!

953
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:31,938
What do you got in there,
some bricks?

954
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:33,864
A lot of gumbo.
Watch out, it's hot! It's hot. It's hot.

955
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,692
Whoa, whoa, whoa, it's hot.

956
00:57:37,496 --> 00:57:40,409
<i>- Smells pretty good, Dad.
- That's a lot of gumbo.</i>

957
00:57:40,499 --> 00:57:42,582
<i>What did you put in there?</i>

958
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,215
Billy?

959
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:55,712
You play the guitar?

960
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:56,967
Nope.

961
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:00,888
No?

962
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:03,095
So how do you explain
what you're doing right there?

963
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:05,726
By watching what you just did.

964
00:58:09,069 --> 00:58:10,901
So, you...

965
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:13,275
you didn't learn at school, or...

966
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:15,857
Nope, we don't have that at school.

967
00:58:16,702 --> 00:58:18,819
Wow, uh...

968
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:20,786
Billy?

969
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:22,283
Yes?

970
00:58:22,374 --> 00:58:26,038
How would you like it
if I took you to a shop,

971
00:58:26,128 --> 00:58:29,462
and bought you a guitar
of your very own?

972
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:32,632
Um, why, yes! Yes!

973
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:35,210
Yes? All right, then it's a date.

974
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:43,551
Hey, sweet pea, how'd your day go?

975
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:46,183
I had the best time with you.

976
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:48,606
Thank you so much, Liam.

977
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:50,399
Uh, thank you.

978
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:52,898
Uh, me, too.

979
00:58:52,988 --> 00:58:55,071
I'll see you tomorrow
for guitar shoppin'.

980
00:58:55,157 --> 00:58:56,489
Yeah.

981
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:02,366
So guitar shopping?

982
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:04,573
Did you know that Billy
plays the guitar?

983
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,702
- Billy?
- Yeah.

984
00:59:11,006 --> 00:59:12,872
She just picked it up
and started playing.

985
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:14,377
It was like it was pouring out of her

986
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:15,834
like she's been playing
her whole life!

987
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:18,294
- Billy can play the guitar?
- Yes.

988
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,550
That's crazy.

989
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:27,558
I'm sorry, I told her
I was gonna get her a guitar.

990
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:31,440
I mean, is it okay if we go
guitar shopping tomorrow,

991
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,017
after school?

992
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:36,441
You should come with us

993
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:38,318
until you're comfortable

994
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,821
with me and Billy spending
time together, obviously.

995
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:43,153
So, you, me, and Billy?

996
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:44,532
Yeah.

997
00:59:49,169 --> 00:59:51,582
Nothing's gonna happen
between us, Liam.

998
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:54,835
I... I never said it was.

999
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:01,049
- Hey, Josie.
- Yeah.

1000
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:05,600
Is it all right if I pick you up
from work tomorrow?

1001
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:12,560
Okay.

1002
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:15,726
I'll pick you up in my dad's car.

1003
01:00:16,947 --> 01:00:18,779
Oh. So she, uh,

1004
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:20,777
she gave you those stats
on convertibles, huh?

1005
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:22,278
Yup!

1006
01:02:21,321 --> 01:02:23,904
You know, I am so excited
that you're sleeping over.

1007
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:29,531
Your mom said that you liked
to be wrapped up like a little burrito.

1008
01:02:29,621 --> 01:02:31,908
- Yup!
- Yeah?

1009
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:33,614
So am I doing this right?

1010
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:34,994
Almost, hang on.

1011
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:37,327
Uh, you forgot the feetsies
and the side.

1012
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,252
Are there more? Okay.

1013
01:02:39,339 --> 01:02:40,671
There you go.

1014
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:42,419
- Perfect!
- Perfect, like a little burrito.

1015
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:45,634
- Okay.
- Hey, Liam.

1016
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,256
Can I ask you a question?

1017
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:48,929
Yeah.

1018
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:50,756
Sure.

1019
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:54,135
What happened?

1020
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:56,642
I mean, why'd you leave my mama?

1021
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:01,358
Oh... man.

1022
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:05,905
<i>Um, well, the short answer is...</i>

1023
01:03:05,991 --> 01:03:07,857
that I was young...

1024
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:10,238
and... dumb.

1025
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:14,743
<i>And that's pretty much
the long answer, too.</i>

1026
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:23,631
All I can tell you...

1027
01:03:23,717 --> 01:03:25,174
is that...

1028
01:03:26,845 --> 01:03:30,464
this one night,
me and your mom were...

1029
01:03:30,557 --> 01:03:34,141
singing in a karaoke bar...
we were just goofing around...

1030
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:37,061
uh, but, as luck would have it,

1031
01:03:37,147 --> 01:03:41,061
this record exec
heard me singing,

1032
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:44,189
and he asked me
to record a song.

1033
01:03:44,279 --> 01:03:47,443
And then the next thing I know,
it's all over the radio,

1034
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:50,650
and then I'm off on tour, just like that.

1035
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:53,612
Like one big wild tornado.

1036
01:03:53,705 --> 01:03:56,118
But why didn't you
take my mama with you?

1037
01:03:59,461 --> 01:04:01,623
I... I wish I did,

1038
01:04:01,713 --> 01:04:03,750
<i>Billy.</i>

1039
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,627
<i>Really, I do.</i>

1040
01:04:06,885 --> 01:04:08,126
<i>But I...</i>

1041
01:04:09,304 --> 01:04:10,715
I was so young, I just,

1042
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:12,421
I-I didn't know...

1043
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:14,632
I didn't know how to handle

1044
01:04:14,726 --> 01:04:16,308
being famous.

1045
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,512
<i>I guess I just...</i>

1046
01:04:19,606 --> 01:04:22,474
<i>I got lost, and I got lost</i>

1047
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:25,935
for such a long time,
I couldn't find my way back.

1048
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,938
But you found your way back now.

1049
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:30,898
You're back, right?

1050
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:34,322
Yeah.

1051
01:04:34,412 --> 01:04:35,994
Yeah, I'm back, Billy.

1052
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:39,248
I'm back.

1053
01:04:40,377 --> 01:04:41,993
- Hey, Liam?
- Mm-hmm.

1054
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:43,248
Could I...

1055
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:46,880
maybe call you "Dad"?

1056
01:04:52,347 --> 01:04:54,430
That...

1057
01:04:54,516 --> 01:04:56,553
Yeah, I would love that,

1058
01:04:56,643 --> 01:04:58,350
more than anything.

1059
01:04:58,436 --> 01:04:59,927
Really.

1060
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:03,480
- Okay.
- Okay.

1061
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:05,102
- Okay, good night.
- Good night.

1062
01:05:05,193 --> 01:05:07,560
All right, you gonna go to sleep?

1063
01:05:07,654 --> 01:05:08,895
Mm-hmm.

1064
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:17,528
Uh...

1065
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:24,202
Billy just asked
if she could call me "Dad."

1066
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:28,672
Yeah.

1067
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:30,750
That's a lot of responsibility.

1068
01:05:31,803 --> 01:05:33,135
Yeah, I know.

1069
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:35,755
It's forever, Liam.

1070
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,886
I know.

1071
01:05:40,228 --> 01:05:42,140
I'm... ready.

1072
01:05:49,821 --> 01:05:52,859
Okay.

1073
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:57,952
I-I, um,

1074
01:05:58,037 --> 01:06:00,154
I should probably get inside...

1075
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:01,784
Oh! Oh...

1076
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:04,037
- You okay?
- I'm just a little bit tipsy.

1077
01:06:17,015 --> 01:06:19,348
Think maybe you could drive me home?

1078
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:21,925
Nope.

1079
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:27,438
Dad?

1080
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:29,437
<i>I'm gonna drive Josie home.</i>

1081
01:07:18,326 --> 01:07:21,910
You know, there is something
I would kind of love to do with you.

1082
01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:24,613
Yeah? What's that?

1083
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:32,417
I would love...

1084
01:07:32,507 --> 01:07:34,544
to go on a date...

1085
01:07:34,634 --> 01:07:36,717
with <i>the</i> Liam Page.

1086
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:40,720
No, come on!
I never got to experience that with you.

1087
01:07:40,807 --> 01:07:43,845
You know, we could get all dressed up,

1088
01:07:43,935 --> 01:07:45,767
go for a fancy dinner somewhere,

1089
01:07:45,853 --> 01:07:47,845
drink tons of champagne.

1090
01:07:47,939 --> 01:07:49,350
Watch your fans go nuts.

1091
01:07:50,817 --> 01:07:52,399
I'd love to do that with you.

1092
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:55,769
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1093
01:07:56,864 --> 01:07:58,651
Are you ready for that?

1094
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:00,323
Oh, I'm ready.

1095
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:03,531
For a date, that is.

1096
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:09,784
With <i>the</i> Liam Page.

1097
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:14,375
How's Saturday night?

1098
01:08:14,465 --> 01:08:16,127
Perfect.

1099
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:17,924
Better call your people,

1100
01:08:18,011 --> 01:08:20,970
let them know you're coming out
of that Caribbean rehab.

1101
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:24,389
My publicist is gonna be so thrilled.

1102
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:25,886
Night!

1103
01:08:25,977 --> 01:08:27,218
Night.

1104
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:31,188
<i>Oh, my gosh,
he gets on my nerves!</i>

1105
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:33,311
Then he fails
the math test, but...

1106
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:35,726
Hey, Billy.

1107
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:37,106
Hey, Dad!

1108
01:08:37,196 --> 01:08:38,232
Hey, girls.

1109
01:08:38,323 --> 01:08:39,689
- Bye!
- Bye!

1110
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:41,193
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah!

1111
01:08:41,284 --> 01:08:43,150
- Bye, Liam.
- Bye, guys.

1112
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:44,530
Bye!

1113
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:49,869
What... what's that?

1114
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:51,495
<i>Behind your back, what's that?</i>

1115
01:08:51,586 --> 01:08:52,827
- Behind my... What?
<i>- Behind your...</i>

1116
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:54,752
- This...
- What, in that hand?

1117
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:56,501
- I can't see a thing.
- Right here, right here, right here!

1118
01:08:56,591 --> 01:08:57,627
Right here! I got it.

1119
01:08:57,717 --> 01:09:00,425
You got it, you got it,
you got it, you got it.

1120
01:09:02,388 --> 01:09:03,720
You didn't!

1121
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:05,138
I did. You wanna do it?

1122
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:06,465
- Yes!
- Yes?

1123
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:08,050
All right!

1124
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:10,352
Grampy's in his car,

1125
01:09:10,438 --> 01:09:12,725
so we're just gonna
have to walk, I think.

1126
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:14,852
Why is my car seat in there, then?

1127
01:09:14,942 --> 01:09:17,650
Uh, I don't know.
I put it in there just in case.

1128
01:09:17,737 --> 01:09:19,945
But I can pick the car up later.
Come on.

1129
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:22,193
No. I'll take it.

1130
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:25,992
You'll... take the convertible?

1131
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:27,240
Yeah.

1132
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:29,822
What about all the stats
you told me about?

1133
01:09:29,916 --> 01:09:33,330
Well, sometimes I gotta let go
and walk on the wild side.

1134
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:35,126
Right, Dad?

1135
01:09:35,213 --> 01:09:37,956
Trust that everything's gonna be okay.

1136
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:44,758
You are something else, Billy.

1137
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:49,766
What kind of... what kind of music
you want to listen to?

1138
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:52,139
Well, the only one there is... country!

1139
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:53,846
That's my girl.

1140
01:10:04,492 --> 01:10:06,700
Yeah!

1141
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:11,408
Whoo!

1142
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:18,504
Wow. Where did you get this dress?

1143
01:10:18,589 --> 01:10:20,626
I borrowed it from Miss Laura.

1144
01:10:20,717 --> 01:10:23,050
She wore it at a Mardi Gras ball
down in Baton Rouge.

1145
01:10:23,136 --> 01:10:24,752
It's pretty, isn't it?

1146
01:10:24,846 --> 01:10:27,259
You're gonna look like
a movie star in it.

1147
01:10:27,348 --> 01:10:29,260
Thank you, sweetie.

1148
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:30,807
Can I put it on?

1149
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:32,725
Okay. Just a little, okay?

1150
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:36,806
Mm.

1151
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:38,435
Feels perfect.

1152
01:10:38,526 --> 01:10:40,017
- Want me to put a little on you?
- Mm-hmm.

1153
01:10:40,111 --> 01:10:41,693
Okay.

1154
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:48,359
Oh...

1155
01:10:48,453 --> 01:10:51,116
How'd I get so lucky to get you?

1156
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:55,328
I'll get it!

1157
01:11:43,424 --> 01:11:45,040
Excuse me, sir?

1158
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:47,376
Do you have any idea
where you're taking me?

1159
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:50,554
<i>Mr. Page wants
it to be a surprise for you.</i>

1160
01:12:46,737 --> 01:12:48,228
<i>Wow!</i>

1161
01:12:48,322 --> 01:12:50,905
<i>I've never seen what New Orleans
looks like from up here.</i>

1162
01:12:50,992 --> 01:12:52,824
<i>It's quite a view, isn't it?</i>

1163
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:56,494
If you look just over there...

1164
01:12:56,581 --> 01:13:00,495
we're gonna land right
on the roof of that hotel.

1165
01:13:01,419 --> 01:13:03,376
- Right, Jimmy?
<i>- That's right, Mr. Page.</i>

1166
01:13:03,462 --> 01:13:05,670
Wait, we're gonna land on that tiny roof?

1167
01:13:05,756 --> 01:13:07,713
Uh, yes, we are.

1168
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,541
<i>You okay with that?</i>

1169
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:11,092
<i>I guess so!</i>

1170
01:13:11,178 --> 01:13:13,465
<i>Well, hold on, here we go.</i>

1171
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:20,977
Oh, welcome!
Welcome, guys, to the French Quarter.

1172
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:22,304
Cody, you're up.

1173
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:24,481
Great to see you
on Southern soil again, Liam.

1174
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:26,274
You too, Cody.
Uh, it's great to be here.

1175
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:29,569
Yeah. On behalf of everyone watching
on Country Music Live right now,

1176
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:30,862
I think we'd all love to know,

1177
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:33,611
who is the beautiful woman
on your arm?

1178
01:13:33,701 --> 01:13:35,818
Uh, this is...

1179
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:37,494
the one.

1180
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:39,242
What's her name?
What's her name?

1181
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:41,790
Uh, that's all I got, guys.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1182
01:14:39,642 --> 01:14:41,429
Now,

1183
01:14:41,519 --> 01:14:43,476
is it just me,
or did the music just stop

1184
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:46,600
and everyone just walked off
the dance floor?

1185
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:48,728
I think they did.

1186
01:14:48,818 --> 01:14:50,650
I still haven't opened my eyes yet.

1187
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:53,604
Wow. Yeah, they did.

1188
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:29,973
Thank you.

1189
01:15:31,902 --> 01:15:33,268
For what?

1190
01:15:36,741 --> 01:15:38,403
For showing me...

1191
01:15:39,744 --> 01:15:41,952
how my life could be
with you in it.

1192
01:15:48,294 --> 01:15:50,411
Good night.

1193
01:15:50,504 --> 01:15:52,336
Uh, good night.

1194
01:15:52,423 --> 01:15:53,755
Go.

1195
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:15,981
<i>This is Sam. Leave it.</i>

1196
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:19,281
Hey, Sam. Give me a call back.

1197
01:16:19,366 --> 01:16:21,073
I need to talk to you
about the tour.

1198
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:24,035
That smells amazing, Johnny.

1199
01:16:24,121 --> 01:16:25,237
Thank you, Josie.

1200
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:27,163
- Hey.
- Hey, now.

1201
01:16:28,501 --> 01:16:30,037
- Hi!
- Hey!

1202
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:31,709
- Oh, hey, hold up!
- Go, go, go, go, go.

1203
01:16:31,796 --> 01:16:34,209
- We're all about to sit down and eat.
- We're hungry lions, man.

1204
01:16:34,298 --> 01:16:36,415
- Yeah, we're hungry lions!
- All right.

1205
01:16:36,509 --> 01:16:38,967
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
you don't eat like that.

1206
01:16:39,053 --> 01:16:41,295
- Why?
- You gotta put the blood on.

1207
01:16:41,388 --> 01:16:43,220
I don't think it needs too much blood.

1208
01:16:43,307 --> 01:16:45,264
Needs some blood.
I'm gonna put some blood on mine.

1209
01:16:45,351 --> 01:16:46,967
Smear it around.

1210
01:16:47,061 --> 01:16:49,269
And then you gotta
smooth it around like that.

1211
01:16:49,355 --> 01:16:52,519
And then you're gonna hold it
in the middle, like this.

1212
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:54,895
Then you're gonna...
eat it like a lion.

1213
01:16:54,985 --> 01:16:56,351
Grrrr...

1214
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:58,107
Rawr!

1215
01:16:58,197 --> 01:17:00,564
<i>There we go!
We're the kings of the jungle right now.</i>

1216
01:17:00,658 --> 01:17:03,241
<i>Well, you're the king,
and I'm the queen.</i>

1217
01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:04,784
How was that? Good?

1218
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:06,657
- Delicious.
- Mmm.

1219
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:09,239
- What's up, man?
- Grab a beer, man. Join me.

1220
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:12,830
No, I'm all good. I'm just kind of greasy
from the rigs, you know?

1221
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:15,333
- All right, we'll be out here.
- Billy.

1222
01:17:16,674 --> 01:17:19,257
Billy! Hey, Liam!
Do something, man.

1223
01:17:19,343 --> 01:17:21,630
She's choking!
It's gonna be okay, Billy. I got you.

1224
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,258
- Billy's choking! Get out here!
- Billy!

1225
01:17:24,348 --> 01:17:26,965
- Take a breath, sweetheart.
- Billy! Come on, come on!

1226
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:28,800
Come on, baby...
She's not breathing!

1227
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:30,977
Baby, come on!
Come on, baby, breathe!

1228
01:17:31,063 --> 01:17:33,430
Come on! Jake, it's not working.
She's not breathing!

1229
01:17:33,524 --> 01:17:35,265
- Okay, I've got it.
- Jake, you have to do something!

1230
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:37,351
Okay, I have this, okay!
Calm down!

1231
01:17:37,444 --> 01:17:39,106
<i>Come on, baby, breathe!
Come on, you got this.</i>

1232
01:17:39,196 --> 01:17:40,858
<i>Stay with me, Billy Ann!
Stay with me!</i>

1233
01:17:40,948 --> 01:17:44,282
<i>- A couple more. Come on, let's go.
- Come on, baby, breathe!</i>

1234
01:17:44,368 --> 01:17:47,076
<i>Julie, give her 10 CCs
of epi and push it.</i>

1235
01:17:47,163 --> 01:17:48,870
<i>Come on, Billy!</i>

1236
01:17:48,956 --> 01:17:50,788
Liam, sweetie?

1237
01:17:50,875 --> 01:17:53,083
Would you go get your daddy for me?

1238
01:17:53,169 --> 01:17:54,501
<i>Liam?</i>

1239
01:17:54,587 --> 01:17:57,751
<i>Sweetie, I need you to go get your daddy.
I think he went down the hall.</i>

1240
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,706
Go get your daddy for me.

1241
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:03,168
Julie, take him to see his dad.
I don't want him to see this.

1242
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:05,345
<i>Come on, Billy Ann Page.</i>

1243
01:18:05,431 --> 01:18:07,343
<i>Come on,
there's still a little more in you.</i>

1244
01:18:07,433 --> 01:18:09,550
<i>Not yet... not yet...</i>

1245
01:18:09,643 --> 01:18:10,850
<i>Come on, baby, breathe!</i>

1246
01:18:10,936 --> 01:18:12,052
<i>Come on, you got this!</i>

1247
01:18:12,146 --> 01:18:13,262
<i>Come on, baby. Come on.</i>

1248
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:15,062
Take a breath, okay?
Here comes a big one.

1249
01:18:16,984 --> 01:18:18,520
Oh!

1250
01:18:18,611 --> 01:18:20,443
You're good. You're good...

1251
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:22,566
Oh. I got you.

1252
01:18:22,656 --> 01:18:24,613
- Oh, my God...
- Let's get some water.

1253
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,566
<i>Let's have some lemonade, okay?</i>

1254
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:35,371
<i>She's all right, she's all right.</i>

1255
01:18:35,461 --> 01:18:36,747
I didn't know
what was happening.

1256
01:18:36,837 --> 01:18:38,703
It's all over now.
It's all over.

1257
01:18:45,888 --> 01:18:47,379
<i>Now, let's eat, everybody.</i>

1258
01:18:47,473 --> 01:18:49,339
<i>Drink some more
lemonade for Mama.</i>

1259
01:18:50,434 --> 01:18:52,346
Oh, you scared Mama.

1260
01:18:52,436 --> 01:18:53,927
You scared me so bad.

1261
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:34,976
Man...

1262
01:19:35,062 --> 01:19:37,429
I didn't know you could
sing like that, Walt.

1263
01:19:37,523 --> 01:19:39,480
Well, I only sing in this bar.

1264
01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:43,025
And you...

1265
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:46,859
you weren't old enough
to come in here before you left.

1266
01:19:50,577 --> 01:19:52,239
<i>You know,</i>

1267
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:54,821
<i>I used to sing in here with your mom.</i>

1268
01:19:57,751 --> 01:19:59,333
You used to sing with my mom?

1269
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:04,335
<i>Billy and I used to get quite
the crowd in here.</i>

1270
01:20:04,425 --> 01:20:05,711
Man...

1271
01:20:08,137 --> 01:20:11,175
<i>But it was you she liked
playing with the most.</i>

1272
01:20:11,265 --> 01:20:13,302
<i>She was always so proud of you.</i>

1273
01:20:18,605 --> 01:20:20,722
That was really nice tonight, Walt.

1274
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:22,182
Thanks, Fred.

1275
01:20:24,028 --> 01:20:25,360
You need a ride?

1276
01:20:28,324 --> 01:20:29,565
I'm all right.

1277
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:31,194
All right, son.

1278
01:20:31,285 --> 01:20:32,366
Take it easy.

1279
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:36,697
- How you doing, Jake?
<i>- Good, Walt.</i>

1280
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:38,622
- Yourself?
- Good.

1281
01:20:40,002 --> 01:20:42,870
<i>I had a feeling you'd be here.</i>

1282
01:20:42,963 --> 01:20:45,046
Hey, Freddy, can I get a beer?

1283
01:20:45,132 --> 01:20:46,498
You got it.

1284
01:20:57,186 --> 01:20:59,303
So, you think you're ready to be a dad...

1285
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:01,137
because you spent a couple weeks
playing house?

1286
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:04,600
<i>You know,</i>

1287
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:07,356
my little niece was choking,

1288
01:21:07,446 --> 01:21:09,483
and you just sat there, Liam.

1289
01:21:11,492 --> 01:21:14,235
I mean, she could have died
if she'd been alone with you.

1290
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:18,663
Man, you gotta be on 24/7
when you're a parent, Liam.

1291
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:23,709
You think you're equipped...

1292
01:21:24,963 --> 01:21:26,829
to keep that little girl alive...

1293
01:21:26,924 --> 01:21:28,335
every day?

1294
01:21:36,016 --> 01:21:38,133
I ain't gonna forget

1295
01:21:38,227 --> 01:21:41,186
all the bad years that Josie had
because of you.

1296
01:21:41,271 --> 01:21:43,479
Right? And I was there for her.

1297
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:45,431
I'm the one that got her through them.

1298
01:21:46,443 --> 01:21:49,402
Josie finally managed to rebuild her life,

1299
01:21:49,488 --> 01:21:51,605
not just for her, but for Billy, too.

1300
01:21:51,698 --> 01:21:53,815
Because you and I, we both know

1301
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:56,447
that you're just gonna
find some way to mess it up.

1302
01:22:00,791 --> 01:22:02,407
And it will destroy them.

1303
01:22:12,052 --> 01:22:14,214
You might have...

1304
01:22:14,304 --> 01:22:17,217
everyone else in this town
fooled right now, but...

1305
01:22:20,561 --> 01:22:21,972
you ain't fooling me.

1306
01:22:35,826 --> 01:22:37,533
I can't believe you smashed your hand

1307
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:39,281
through that bar mirror.

1308
01:22:40,247 --> 01:22:42,034
I'm almost done.

1309
01:22:42,124 --> 01:22:45,208
You'll be able to play again in no time.

1310
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:47,956
I never want to play again.

1311
01:22:48,046 --> 01:22:50,288
Now, don't say that, don't say that.

1312
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:53,295
It's a God-given talent
to be able to play

1313
01:22:53,385 --> 01:22:55,092
and sing the way you do.

1314
01:22:55,179 --> 01:22:56,761
I don't deserve it.

1315
01:23:01,268 --> 01:23:02,679
Let's face it.

1316
01:23:02,769 --> 01:23:04,351
Just be honest.

1317
01:23:04,438 --> 01:23:06,100
I'm a bad person, Dad.

1318
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:07,931
- Liam...
- Come on, it's okay.

1319
01:23:08,025 --> 01:23:09,266
It's true!

1320
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:11,817
We've... we've all forgiven you, son.

1321
01:23:13,197 --> 01:23:14,608
You shouldn't have.

1322
01:23:18,744 --> 01:23:20,030
I'm sorry.

1323
01:23:26,126 --> 01:23:28,209
I'm sorry that I left you.

1324
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:32,080
I'm sorry that I didn't
get in touch with you.

1325
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:36,092
I honestly don't know why I did it.

1326
01:23:39,139 --> 01:23:41,597
I know, I know.

1327
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:43,970
The further away I went...

1328
01:23:46,271 --> 01:23:48,479
and the longer I was gone...

1329
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:52,601
the more pain I was in at the end.

1330
01:23:55,948 --> 01:23:57,280
I'm sorry.

1331
01:23:58,116 --> 01:23:59,106
I know you are.

1332
01:23:59,952 --> 01:24:01,284
<i>I just didn't know how to get out.</i>

1333
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:02,656
I know.

1334
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:12,545
When your mom died, son...

1335
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:14,668
I was so stuck in my own grief...

1336
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:19,298
I somehow overlooked yours.

1337
01:24:21,807 --> 01:24:23,764
I got comforting words
for everyone in this town

1338
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:26,058
during their time of need, but...

1339
01:24:27,312 --> 01:24:30,100
I wasn't able to talk
to my own son during his.

1340
01:24:39,116 --> 01:24:40,402
That wound...

1341
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:42,484
that terrible wound...

1342
01:24:44,162 --> 01:24:47,405
losing your mom the way you did
at such a young age,

1343
01:24:47,499 --> 01:24:50,867
<i>I think being famous just fed that pain,</i>

1344
01:24:50,961 --> 01:24:53,624
<i>knocked down everything in its path.</i>

1345
01:25:02,514 --> 01:25:05,097
So I'm the one who's sorry, Liam.

1346
01:25:06,184 --> 01:25:08,141
I'm so, so sorry.

1347
01:28:49,491 --> 01:28:51,733
Thank you. Thank you, London.

1348
01:28:58,333 --> 01:29:00,165
All right, all right.

1349
01:29:00,252 --> 01:29:01,709
Liam! Liam!

1350
01:29:01,795 --> 01:29:03,878
Great, great show, man.

1351
01:29:03,964 --> 01:29:05,956
- Nice singing there, Stacey.
- Thanks, Sam.

1352
01:29:06,049 --> 01:29:08,211
Liam, that was seriously
the best set

1353
01:29:08,301 --> 01:29:10,133
I think I've ever seen you perform.

1354
01:29:11,012 --> 01:29:12,753
Man, I think these new songs of yours,

1355
01:29:12,848 --> 01:29:15,807
they're just...
just crushing it, you know?

1356
01:29:15,892 --> 01:29:18,100
Just get me out of here, Sam.

1357
01:29:56,683 --> 01:29:57,924
Sorry, man.

1358
01:30:05,358 --> 01:30:07,270
Liam, why are you
doing this to yourself?

1359
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:10,061
What?

1360
01:30:10,155 --> 01:30:11,737
What the heck happened
when you were home?

1361
01:30:11,823 --> 01:30:13,610
She almost died because of me.

1362
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:15,066
Who?

1363
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:16,571
Billy.

1364
01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:19,991
I mean, we were...

1365
01:30:20,081 --> 01:30:22,414
we were all about to have dinner
in the backyard,

1366
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,708
and Billy started choking,

1367
01:30:24,794 --> 01:30:27,537
and I just... I froze, man.

1368
01:30:27,631 --> 01:30:29,623
I was paralyzed by it.

1369
01:30:29,716 --> 01:30:32,675
I'm not a fully formed
human being, Sam.

1370
01:30:32,761 --> 01:30:34,468
I'm just not.

1371
01:30:34,554 --> 01:30:35,670
Liam,

1372
01:30:35,764 --> 01:30:37,926
you froze with Billy

1373
01:30:38,016 --> 01:30:39,302
because you love her.

1374
01:30:42,854 --> 01:30:44,686
She could have died, Sam.

1375
01:30:44,773 --> 01:30:47,015
But she didn't die, Liam.

1376
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:50,977
<i>And look,
we all mess up sometimes, Liam.</i>

1377
01:30:51,071 --> 01:30:53,563
<i>But it's what you do
after you mess up that counts.</i>

1378
01:30:53,657 --> 01:30:56,491
<i>You show up, you be there.</i>

1379
01:30:58,244 --> 01:30:59,701
You know what?

1380
01:30:59,788 --> 01:31:01,029
This whole time I managed you,

1381
01:31:01,122 --> 01:31:03,364
you ain't been nothing
but a big, fat idiot.

1382
01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:04,665
- You know that?
- Yeah.

1383
01:31:04,751 --> 01:31:05,787
Yeah, it's true.

1384
01:31:05,877 --> 01:31:07,664
And I get it, I do.

1385
01:31:07,754 --> 01:31:10,417
There are far better men than you
out there, no doubt.

1386
01:31:10,507 --> 01:31:11,839
Uh-huh.

1387
01:31:14,511 --> 01:31:16,594
<i>But Josie doesn't love them, Liam,</i>

1388
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:18,717
<i>she loves you.</i>

1389
01:31:18,807 --> 01:31:20,890
<i>And lucky for her, man,</i>

1390
01:31:20,976 --> 01:31:23,593
<i>'cause you love her, too.</i>

1391
01:31:33,363 --> 01:31:34,774
- Doris?
- Yeah.

1392
01:31:34,864 --> 01:31:36,776
- I need to get off this plane.
- You're what?

1393
01:31:36,866 --> 01:31:38,323
I need to get off this plane.

1394
01:31:38,410 --> 01:31:41,323
Uh, can you ask the pilot
to stay put, please?

1395
01:31:41,413 --> 01:31:42,870
- Of course, I'll let the pilot know.
- No, no, no!

1396
01:31:42,956 --> 01:31:44,322
You tell the pilot to go!

1397
01:31:44,416 --> 01:31:45,452
<i>To fly away!</i>

1398
01:31:45,542 --> 01:31:47,659
You... you know that we
are supposed to leave right now,

1399
01:31:47,752 --> 01:31:49,709
so we are going... right now...
into the air!

1400
01:31:49,796 --> 01:31:51,412
<i>Can you just ask
the pilot to open the door?</i>

1401
01:31:51,506 --> 01:31:52,622
<i>You tell the pilot</i>

1402
01:31:52,716 --> 01:31:54,799
that you are locking the doors
and we are taking off!

1403
01:31:54,884 --> 01:31:57,001
- I need to get off this plane.
- You are not getting off this plane.

1404
01:31:57,095 --> 01:31:59,382
- I'm getting off this plane.
- You are performing in Berlin

1405
01:31:59,472 --> 01:32:00,963
in 14 hours!

1406
01:32:01,057 --> 01:32:03,174
In 14 hours,
I'm gonna be in Louisiana.

1407
01:32:03,268 --> 01:32:04,349
All right!

1408
01:32:04,436 --> 01:32:05,722
For the love of God,

1409
01:32:05,812 --> 01:32:07,644
do not get off this plane.

1410
01:32:07,731 --> 01:32:10,769
<i>April 9th, one saved message.</i>

1411
01:32:10,859 --> 01:32:13,101
<i>Hi, Liam. It's me, Josie.</i>

1412
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:16,403
<i>I've called you so many times,
I've lost count.</i>

1413
01:32:16,489 --> 01:32:19,527
<i>I still don't know why you left me
on our wedding day.</i>

1414
01:32:19,617 --> 01:32:22,576
<i>I don't know if I'll ever find out.</i>

1415
01:32:22,662 --> 01:32:25,496
<i>But I really need you to call me back.</i>

1416
01:32:25,582 --> 01:32:27,790
<i>If you don't, I promised myself</i>

1417
01:32:27,876 --> 01:32:29,583
<i>that I'll never call you again.</i>

1418
01:32:31,046 --> 01:32:33,629
<i>I have to find some way
to move on with my life.</i>

1419
01:32:35,050 --> 01:32:37,042
<i>But I want you to know...</i>

1420
01:32:37,927 --> 01:32:39,964
<i>If I don't ever hear back from you...</i>

1421
01:32:41,056 --> 01:32:42,922
<i>I will always love you, Liam.</i>

1422
01:32:43,933 --> 01:32:47,017
<i>You will always be the one for me.</i>

1423
01:32:48,104 --> 01:32:49,891
<i>And you'll have my heart forever.</i>

1424
01:33:09,542 --> 01:33:12,080
<i>Hey, it's Josie. Leave a message.</i>

1425
01:33:13,713 --> 01:33:15,579
Uh...

1426
01:33:15,673 --> 01:33:18,666
Hey... Josie.

1427
01:33:20,095 --> 01:33:21,381
It's me.

1428
01:33:23,389 --> 01:33:27,053
It's taken me eight years
to return this message.

1429
01:33:29,562 --> 01:33:31,554
I mean, I always wanted to.

1430
01:33:32,524 --> 01:33:34,231
But I knew that I needed

1431
01:33:34,317 --> 01:33:36,934
to know how to tell you...

1432
01:33:37,028 --> 01:33:39,486
why I did what I did.

1433
01:33:40,490 --> 01:33:42,402
And I hadn't figured it out...

1434
01:33:43,618 --> 01:33:45,075
until now.

1435
01:33:47,705 --> 01:33:51,244
You see, my mom was the love
of my life until I met you.

1436
01:33:53,628 --> 01:33:54,914
And...

1437
01:33:56,256 --> 01:33:58,543
I know we were young,

1438
01:33:58,633 --> 01:34:01,250
but the thought of possibly
losing you one day,

1439
01:34:01,344 --> 01:34:03,051
the way that I lost her...

1440
01:34:05,098 --> 01:34:07,385
I found my heart couldn't take it, so...

1441
01:34:07,475 --> 01:34:09,683
<i>I ran...</i>

1442
01:34:11,479 --> 01:34:14,096
<i>But I could never move on, Josie.</i>

1443
01:34:15,608 --> 01:34:18,066
<i>And that message that you left me,</i>

1444
01:34:18,153 --> 01:34:19,610
<i>I did listen to it.</i>

1445
01:34:21,072 --> 01:34:23,655
<i>I listened to it every day
for the last eight years.</i>

1446
01:34:24,868 --> 01:34:27,611
<i>And then, when I met Billy,</i>

1447
01:34:27,704 --> 01:34:29,991
<i>my heartjust burst open.</i>

1448
01:34:31,833 --> 01:34:34,075
<i>I thought I wasn't good enough
for you two.</i>

1449
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:38,538
<i>But I'm gonna spend
the rest of my life trying to be.</i>

1450
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:46,469
<i>I'm never leaving Saint again</i>

1451
01:34:46,556 --> 01:34:49,674
<i>without you and Billy by my side.</i>

1452
01:34:54,189 --> 01:34:56,101
Josie!

1453
01:34:57,942 --> 01:34:59,558
Josie!

1454
01:35:01,321 --> 01:35:03,233
<i>You're the one.</i>

1455
01:35:03,323 --> 01:35:05,110
<i>You've always been the one.</i>

1456
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:05,257
So you've been carrying around

1457
01:36:05,343 --> 01:36:08,507
this old, beat up, duct-taped,

1458
01:36:08,596 --> 01:36:10,713
really ugly cell phone
the past eight years

1459
01:36:10,807 --> 01:36:11,968
because of me?

1460
01:36:13,768 --> 01:36:14,929
Yeah.

1461
01:36:18,648 --> 01:36:20,264
And you really
listened to that message

1462
01:36:20,358 --> 01:36:22,691
every single day
since I left it there?

1463
01:36:24,529 --> 01:36:26,270
Yeah.

1464
01:36:27,824 --> 01:36:30,783
And you're not ever leaving
Saint again without Billy or me?

1465
01:36:33,371 --> 01:36:34,862
Never.

1466
01:36:35,623 --> 01:36:37,990
Then I just wanted to say...

1467
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,212
welcome home.

1468
01:37:16,706 --> 01:37:18,823
Hey, I'm Jake.

1469
01:37:18,916 --> 01:37:20,657
Hi, I'm Doris.

1470
01:37:20,752 --> 01:37:22,618
Well, it's nice to meet you, Doris.

1471
01:37:22,712 --> 01:37:24,453
You smell good, Jake.

1472
01:37:28,259 --> 01:37:29,795
- Yeah!
- Whoo-hoo!

1473
01:37:32,138 --> 01:37:33,925
Yeah!

1474
01:37:38,686 --> 01:37:40,268
- Whoo!
- Go, Billy!

1475
01:37:40,355 --> 01:37:41,891
Whoo!

1476
01:37:41,981 --> 01:37:44,564
And for once,
you all know my dad.

1477
01:37:50,615 --> 01:37:52,652
This is a song we like to call,

1478
01:37:52,742 --> 01:37:55,029
"Finally Home."

1479
01:39:18,995 --> 01:39:20,076
Hi.
