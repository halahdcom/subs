00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,617
DEFCON 1! You know what I mean.

154
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:57,703
What are the meals?

155
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,957
Okay. I'm gonna take her
the truffle mac and cheese.

156
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,458
You can have the burger.

157
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:06,504
Are you insane? I won't give him
a plain hamburger. He has taste.

158
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,422
Okay. I'm gonna fix this, okay?

159
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:13,678
See what I'm making?
It's a truffle cheeseburger with kale.

160
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,100
This burger could win awards.
Pickle is my dinner.

161
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,268
- No, no, no.
- What?

162
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:23,062
I won't give him a truffle cheeseburger
without a pickle.

163
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,736
I wanna be paid back tomorrow,
8 percent interest, liquidity preference.

164
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,530
Do I look like I can afford interest?

165
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,991
I steal my toilet paper
from the office bathroom.

166
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,493
You should learn to keep cash on you.

167
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:41,706
You should remember to order dinner
before everything closes.

168
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,625
You know that pickle?
That aforementioned pickle?

169
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,086
That wasn't for my boss.
That was for me.

170
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,214
You're a monster.

171
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,013
- Oh, hi.
- I'll need you in here before me tomorrow.

172
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,641
Okay, what time would that be?
Do you want your food? Okay.

173
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,320
[intercom buzzing]

174
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,239
- [Suze] Hello?
- I'm here, I'm here.

175
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,783
You took too long. I'm in bed.

176
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,494
Okay. Perfect. I'll get in with you.

177
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,288
I'm already asleep, baby.

178
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,000
I can wake you up. With my penis.

179
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:31,922
Not with my penis. You'll be fully awake
when it touches... You know what I mean.

180
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,175
I have an early shoot tomorrow

181
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:36,719
and if I don't get eight hours,
my face could be puffy.

182
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:41,557
- Can I call you in the morning?
- Yeah. Sweet dreams... princess.

183
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:44,393
[man] You can wake me up.

184
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:47,938
With your penis.

185
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,029
[announcer on TV]...should be
the final play unless there's a penalty.

186
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,116
Kellogg's throw...

187
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,579
It's gonna be tapped and caught!
It's caught!

188
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,122
It's caught!

189
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,041
- [door opens]
- [laughing]

190
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:12,463
You're up! Oh, my gosh, hi.

191
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:14,006
How was your date?

192
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,093
It was good. He's in my room now
drinking Gatorade

193
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,762
to recover from our vigorous love-making.

194
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,263
- Nice.
- Really?

195
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,682
No. I worked late. Didn't make it in time.

196
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:24,934
Oh...

197
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,978
Dude, loved Kirsten's article
about Cleveland fans.

198
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,147
- I sent it to ten people.
- He did.

199
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,733
Wasn't it awesome? How was the party?

200
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,026
Gilbert was there.

201
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,112
You haven't seen him since...

202
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:37,405
[Becca laughing]

203
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,492
Since she had sex with him
in the bathroom on the Acela?

204
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:45,621
- You told him about that?
- I could read it from your hand code.

205
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:47,123
I tell him everything, Harp.

206
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,458
If we had to avoid every guy
she's had sex with

207
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,586
on public transportation,
we'd never leave the apartment.

208
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,006
- [chuckles] Shut up.
- Do you want a glass of cold water?

209
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,092
- Yes. I would love that.
- Okay.

210
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,844
- I love you.
- I love you so much.

211
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,471
- Love you, Mike.
- I love you, Harper.

212
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,850
He's such a dork. Oh, God. I love him.

213
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,102
- I love you. I'm gonna go to bed.
- Sweet dreams.

214
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,019
Good night.

215
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:13,899
[Becca screams]

216
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,401
- Janet?
- [Becca] What?

217
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,027
No way!

218
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,904
- No way!
- [Mike chuckles]

219
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,781
I said no. I...

220
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,909
I'm kidding! I said yes! [shouts]

221
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:27,830
Oh, my God. We're not old enough
to get married, though.

222
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,540
What? What?

223
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,292
I love you.

224
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:35,504
Congratulations. Congratulations
and I'm so happy for you.

225
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,174
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

226
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:41,051
- I love you, Mike! My favorite people.
- I love you, Harper!

227
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:44,388
- I was talking to my mom...
- I'm gonna let you do that.

228
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,975
I just wanna spend my life with you.

229
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,269
- Are you kidding me?
- Oh, my God.

230
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,312
[Mike] I'm so excited.

231
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,208
- [Duncan] Hey, buddy.
- [yelps]

232
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,419
What...? How long have you been there?

233
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,007
You're sitting alone in the dark?

234
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,805
Do you have a guy over?

235
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,807
Why do you always assume
I have a guy over?

236
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,018
Not all gay guys are having sex
all the time.

237
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,395
- Don't you have to teach soon?
- Can't sleep.

238
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:37,358
I'm setting up this art show for a kid
living at a homeless shelter with his mom.

239
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:40,361
I think he's good enough to get into
one of those magnet schools.

240
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:44,990
Today I got a waiter fired for dripping
condensation on Rick's pant leg, so...

241
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,200
I also feel good.

242
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:51,372
When you get promoted, you can be one of
those rich guys that donates supplies.

243
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,082
So you don't feel so bad.

244
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,960
We love that guy.
We make him a card every year.

245
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,174
- I'll call you later.
- You better.

246
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,885
[door opens then closes]

247
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,931
Technically, this time,
I did have a guy over.

248
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:26,073
[Dan] Martin's leaving.
He's gonna be a VP at Sequoia Capital.

249
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:29,118
Serious? He's jumping associate
and right to VP?

250
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,537
It's Rick. He knows everybody there.

251
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,290
If you got his stamp of approval,

252
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,167
- it's the golden ticket.
- Martin's barely 30.

253
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:41,255
We weren't talking to you, dipshit.
Go get Rick a smoothie.

254
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,090
[both laughing]

255
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,800
I don't get Rick smoothies.

256
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,761
He's on a juice cleanse.

257
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,054
[chattering]

258
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:54,310
Paying student athletes
is such a hot-button issue.

259
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:58,606
You couldn't back off? You're implying
we're getting rich off poor kids.

260
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:03,110
We're not. We're proving it. Your AD
bought a $2-million boat last year.

261
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:05,279
Your star player is on food stamps.

262
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:09,658
Kirsten, we are all
a big happy family here.

263
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:13,120
We've always liked you.
We like what you're doing here,

264
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:16,624
but don't make a name for yourself
by burning bridges. [chuckles]

265
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,500
I sent you that article as a courtesy.

266
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:22,463
I'm not changing a word.
I will send you the link when it is live.

267
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,676
- That was incredible. You just feel like...
- Ah-ah.

268
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,761
Where's my lunch?

269
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,805
- I'm gonna get it.
- Tell me something I don't know!

270
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,060
Here are those ETFs.

271
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,686
[cell phone beeps]

272
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,649
[sighs]

273
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:43,692
- Intern?
- My name's Bo.

274
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:46,820
- I don't give a shit.
- It has fewer syllables.

275
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,865
Cover Rick's phone. I'm gonna get lunch.
All right?

276
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:54,328
Don't pee, don't zone out, don't sneeze.
Just cover his phones, try not to exist.

277
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,248
Do not ever, ever connect to his ex-wife.

278
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:01,251
- Do I tell him if she calls?
- Yeah.

279
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:05,923
And slather my dick in ink and use it
to write the hieroglyphic for "no."

280
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:09,760
- I don't know hieroglyphics.
- Sorry. That was over the line.

281
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,470
But no, don't tell him. Go.

282
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,683
Do not put on any more clothes.
I'm coming over.

283
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,101
[Rick shouts, then crashing]

284
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,143
Oh, shit.

285
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,937
[Rick] Someone's ass is fired!

286
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:25,442
- What happened?
- He's upset about this.

287
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,114
- [Rick] Goddamn you, Kiki!
- This is his ex-wife.

288
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,075
Kiki Otis is...? Oh, that makes sense.

289
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,953
"Spiritual commitment ceremony"?
You showed him this?

290
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,830
You didn't say anything about his mail.

291
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,915
- You have no idea what...
- It's non-legal.

292
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,083
Rick?

293
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,754
What is this?! Bulletproof glass?!

294
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,591
Where's pencil-dick?

295
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:52,511
- I feel like I'm pencil-dick.
- You're fired.

296
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:56,515
Charlie, take his work. I don't
wanna see pencil-dick's face again.

297
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:02,354
Pencils can be all lengths and girths,
so, the joke's on him.

298
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:07,943
Obviously, you're talented.
You don't have to keep convincing us.

299
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,320
Start by taking out the adjectives.

300
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:13,365
- Thank you so much.
- Anything for a Dartmouth grad.

301
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,075
It's late. Get out of here.

302
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,705
You are so lucky to work for her.

303
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,416
- I know.
- I reached out to her

304
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:25,044
through the alumni magazine
and she responded right away.

305
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,879
Now she's gonna be my mentor.

306
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,089
She's amazing.

307
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,382
[chuckles]

308
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,805
Harper, I'm gonna take a nap.
So, just wake me up at midnight.

309
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:42,144
Oh, but don't startle me. Play a lullaby
then slowly increase the volume.

310
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:44,855
Okay.

311
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:01,955
- Hello.
- Holy shit.

312
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:06,001
Here's your stupid interest. There you go.

313
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:09,630
What are you still doing here?
Are you like a janitor?

314
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,674
Do I look like a janitor?

315
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:14,635
No.

316
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,137
I work for Kirsten Stevens.

317
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,807
- Who?
- The sports reporter from ESPN.

318
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,308
Okay.

319
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:24,394
She got Roger Goodell to admit he'd
seen the video? Don't know her?

320
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,815
She broke the Penguins
concussion protocol story

321
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:31,944
- that literally changed the NHL.
- But what are you doing here?

322
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,196
I can't leave until she leaves.

323
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:38,075
And she never leaves,
so, I'm always the last one here.

324
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,952
- I'm the last one here.
- No, you're not.

325
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:43,664
- Even when Rick's not here, I'm here.
- Kirsten keeps a cot in her office.

326
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:46,834
Rick keeps a Tempur-Pedic cot
in his office. The Tesla of cots.

327
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:50,129
Kirsten's like if Miss Piggy and Voldemort
had a baby

328
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:53,674
and that baby had low blood sugar
and hadn't had sex in a year.

329
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,927
Don't talk about babies having sex.
What's wrong with you?

330
00:18:58,595 --> 00:18:59,763
Do you want some?

331
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:05,894
Rick throws away any liquor
that costs less than $200.

332
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,063
We're at work.

333
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,691
It's almost midnight. Grow up.

334
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,819
It's been so long,
I have the tolerance of a fetus.

335
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:16,905
[laughing]

336
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,867
[man] It was a tough loss, but we're
putting it behind us. Looking forward.

337
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,910
The third glass is still bad.

338
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:25,080
If you could watch the ball
as well as you're watching my tits,

339
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,665
you could have made the playoffs.

340
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:29,376
I wanna have an article
on her site someday.

341
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,795
My God. Will you look at this?

342
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,009
Suze gets invited to cool shit.
I miss all of it.

343
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:40,304
I miss everything. It's been so long
since I've been to a party.

344
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:44,474
Or made out with a guy. I don't even
remember how. Like my tongue atrophied.

345
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,729
When my mom was my age, she had me.
I've never had a boyfriend.

346
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,190
But you're a grown-up.

347
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,441
Take that back.

348
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:57,487
- Not even like a camp boyfriend?
- I'm gonna end up like Kirsten.

349
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:58,822
[Harper chuckles]

350
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:03,952
Like buying thousand-dollar throw blankets
and... sleeping with my computer.

351
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:08,373
That's why she's so mean. She's sleeping
with a laptop. She needs to get laid.

352
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,920
- She needs to be made love to.
- Well, Rick needs to get laid.

353
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:17,299
The two of them are always in this office.
Let's lock them together

354
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,092
so they can have sex with each other.

355
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,011
[both laughing]

356
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,598
Think about it.
We Cyrano them out of the office.

357
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:27,476
And then when they're boning, we're free.

358
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:31,438
Well, I don't need to be free,
I need to be promoted.

359
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:37,110
All I care about is that I'm not
still an assistant when I'm 28 years old.

360
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,946
That's when it gets really sad.

361
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:41,740
- I'm 28.
- I'm so sorry. [chuckles]

362
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,910
- For you. That's sad for you.
- You should leave.

363
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,453
Bye.

364
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,051
- I made something.
- What...?

365
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,095
You're so quiet.
You move like a Prius.

366
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,430
- What is that?
- It's a spreadsheet

367
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,058
of everything I know about Kirsten.

368
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:11,603
- What she likes, doesn't like.
- I have no idea what this is for.

369
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:14,856
To set them up.

370
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,026
For our Cyrano.

371
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:22,114
- That was a joke.
- But it doesn't have to be.

372
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,742
- What's Rick's favorite food?
- The filet from Ai Fiori's.

373
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,912
- Where will he be at 3?
- His son's school play.

374
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:33,208
- Hey, what does he hate?
- "Geoff" spelled with G and sour cream.

375
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,544
We know everything about them.
What they like.

376
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:39,715
We control their entire schedule.
We are the men behind the curtain.

377
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,550
We can get them to do anything.

378
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,181
- This is very thorough.
- Thank you.

379
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,726
- Absolutely not.
- What?

380
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,102
- I thought...
- This is insane.

381
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:54,229
I barely have time to do my job.

382
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:58,066
- If Rick found out, he'd fire me.
- He'd never find out.

383
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:03,530
- This could save us.
- I gotta take my girlfriend to lunch.

384
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:07,326
- Should I send this to you?
- Please don't.

385
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,703
["Yankee Doodle" playing on speakers]

386
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,121
Oh, Suze.

387
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:12,956
Suze.

388
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:17,669
Mm. Mm.

389
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:22,674
- I thought we were getting lunch.
- Excuse me. Are those seats taken?

390
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,843
Yeah, sorry. They're taken.

391
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:26,970
Yeah, I know we were.

392
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:31,016
Rick needed me to save the seats.
His son's the second lead.

393
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,936
I thought we could do a theater picnic.

394
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:40,317
Hey, you look amazing.
How'd the, uh, thing go this morning?

395
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:43,320
Good. I booked that Old Navy campaign.

396
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,197
That is incredible.

397
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:51,411
Look, I'm gonna be traveling so much
and you're already so busy.

398
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,871
No. I'm not busy.

399
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:56,583
I don't wanna be with a guy
saving somebody else's seats.

400
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,504
I want the guy whose seats
are being saved, you know?

401
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:05,133
- I think we should...
- No! [clearing throat]

402
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,136
I know this is annoying...

403
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:13,141
Ma'am, I would lay my life down for these.
If you can't say the same, move on.

404
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,560
We can make this work.

405
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:19,481
I'm about to get promoted.
My schedule will be easier.

406
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,234
Then our seats are gonna be saved.

407
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:23,485
I promise.

408
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,531
- Hey.
- Excuse me.

409
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,033
- [boy] Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

410
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,535
I like the beard.

411
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,246
- You got these seats?
- Yeah.

412
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:37,999
You're gonna have to get me a masseuse.
We're three centimeters from the stage.

413
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,837
What is wrong with you?
I'll mess up my neck.

414
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:47,551
Oh.

415
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,511
Lot of hot moms here.

416
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,888
Holler.

417
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:00,147
I'm in.

418
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,192
When they're boning, we're free, right?

419
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,529
Where could they meet?

420
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,700
- Rick's usually at the District Club.
- Okay.

421
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:15,245
- Could she run into him there?
- Sure. She can run into him.

422
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:20,167
After she's nominated by two members,
one former member, approved by the board.

423
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,378
Also has a sex change.
Technically, women are allowed.

424
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:25,589
- I get it.
- Rick cares about winning.

425
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:28,800
We just gotta make your boss
seem like a business deal

426
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:30,802
or a softball game.

427
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:33,763
All Kirsten cares about
is her site, her brand.

428
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:37,017
- It's like her baby.
- She shouldn't have a real baby.

429
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:37,934
How dare you.

430
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:41,396
But I do think that's a huge part of it.

431
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:48,195
We need a meet cute.
Like, every great romance has a meet cute.

432
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,781
Like, getting stuck in an elevator
or something, but...

433
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:55,827
- Let's get them stuck in an elevator.
- How would we do that?

434
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,205
You don't know Creepy Tim?

435
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:00,749
A succulent.

436
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,420
Can you grow plants down here?

437
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,381
Oh, no. They just slowly die.

438
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,718
Oh.

439
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:15,222
So, buddy, we wanted
to shut down the elevator

440
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:16,973
so two people could fall in love.

441
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,059
Charlie...

442
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:23,313
the only thing I love more than love
is love in enclosed spaces.

443
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,690
And succulents.

444
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:30,528
And you already gave me
one of those, so, my answer is yes.

445
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:45,335
Falcon One's headed to the Nest.
We are a go for Pandora's Box.

446
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,629
You're not in the Secret Service.
Say "elevator."

447
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,216
- We're a go for Pandora's Box.
- Copy that.

448
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,135
[Harper] There she is.

449
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,097
Okay, can you stop at her floor?

450
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:04,729
Say something.

451
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:05,897
What?

452
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:09,234
Does no one look each other
in the eyes anymore?

453
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,112
Oh.

454
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:16,533
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who's this guy?
- You need to go, sir.

455
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:19,369
- Make your way out.
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

456
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,579
- [both] Call it off.
- It's go time.

457
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:24,332
- What the hell?
- What did you think?

458
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,169
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, no.

459
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:31,214
Can you start it back up?

[chuckles]

462
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:38,263
Thank you, God. I'm extremely
claustrophobic. That would've been bad.

463
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,806
But you work on a truck.

464
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,641
Let it go, Rick.

465
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:45,103
Your job is to ride elevators.
How are you claustrophobic?

466
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:49,190
I usually take the stairs.
But today was a big day.

467
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:51,860
Okay, let's not make it any worse.

468
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,196
[alarm buzzes]

469
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,407
- Why did you do that?
- That wasn't me.

470
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:00,076
This might be
an actual system malfunction.

471
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:01,953
Oh, my God.

472
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:07,876
This has never happened before.
Oh, irony, you fickle queen.

473
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:13,256
Yup. This is how it always starts
in my nightmare.

474
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:17,135
Here we go. All right.
We just all need to calm down.

475
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:18,887
[Joe sighs]

476
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,431
- Uh, what are you doing?
- What is he doing?

477
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:23,892
Is it getting hot in here?

478
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:28,146
Stop doing that, please. Stop now.

479
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:29,981
- I need to be free of this.
- Stop that.

480
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,316
Okay.

481
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:35,904
The pants are off.
I'm calling the firefighters.

482
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,697
Don't. I'm calling the real police.

483
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,825
Okay, this button is designed
for this emergency.

484
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,370
You want the emergency response team,

485
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,705
not the jackoffs
assigned to the Elevator Squad.

486
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,499
No. Maybe we can make a rope.

487
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:49,918
You're not gonna get service.
It's already ringing.

488
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,213
- Excuse me.
- If we press it at the same time,

489
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:55,840
- it'll confuse the system.
- [Kirsten] It was ringing.

490
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,426
I gotta pee. I'm gonna pee.

491
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,720
If you pee, I will end your life.

492
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:04,391
Stress incontinence. That is a real
condition and you are not helping.

493
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:06,476
I'm gonna listen to my body.

494
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:07,811
Oh.

495
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:09,854
[both] Don't pee.

496
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:10,897
Pee.

497
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:17,195
- Do not pee in there. Do not pee in the...

502
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,296
Ah.

503
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:45,974
Hello.

504
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:51,187
I'm not great at reading rooms,
but I can tell that was a success.

505
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,650
It was okay.

506
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,403
- Are you kidding?
- Hmm?

507
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:01,406
That was a disaster.
They hate each other.

508
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:04,826
Hate, we can work with.
Hate is not the opposite of love.

509
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,703
Know what the opposite of love is?

510
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,121
- Ice.
- Indifference.

511
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:12,917
Well, that's also very true, Creepy Tim.
[gasps]

512
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,337
- Uh...
- People call me Creepy Tim?

513
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,506
No.

514
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,300
I love it.

515
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,761
Your dry cleaning's in the car,

516
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:26,681
and I forwarded you Jeff's itinerary
for the Simone Biles profile.

517
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:29,392
Oh.

518
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:33,646
And, also, apparently some guy
you were stuck in the elevator with

519
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,107
asked security for your contact info.

520
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,778
- Was it the delivery man?
- No.

521
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:42,447
Um, some big shot in the building.

522
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,034
I guess he has a crush on you.

523
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:51,915
But don't worry, I told them we do not
give out your number, okay?

524
00:29:56,586 --> 00:30:00,965
I heard you got stuck in an elevator
with that sports reporter. Kirsten...?

525
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:04,385
Kirsten Stevens.
I knew I recognized her from somewhere.

526
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,845
Kirsten Stevens.

527
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:09,933
I think Mark Cuban is thinking
about investing in her site.

528
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:14,604
Hmm.

529
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,612
I did it. What now?

530
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:24,531
[Harper]
Does Rick have good Yankees tickets?

531
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:28,076
No, he watches from the bleachers
like a peasant. He does.

532
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:34,499
[Harper] Charlie?

533
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:36,960
Hi, I'm so sorry.

534
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:40,380
So sorry. I got here so early
that I thought I had time to dick around,

535
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:42,215
so I went there, lost track of time

536
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:44,634
- and was late.
- That's the dumbest thing I've heard.

537
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:46,678
- That is not a real thing.
- It is.

538
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:49,722
It's the over-dick-around thing.
I over-dicked it.

539
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:53,434
- Why are you wearing that?
- I'm going to a baseball game.

540
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,187
Why are you wearing that?

541
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:59,274
I'm not on the team.
Why would I wear the jersey?

542
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:02,735
- I don't wear scrubs to the doctor's.
- I'll get nachos.

543
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,197
I've made a mistake.

544

[Harper] What are you doing? Come on!

545
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,088
- [Harper] Bobby?
- [Bobby] Harper?

546
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:24,841
[Harper] Hey, I need a favor. We need...

547
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:26,217
the people...

548

in these two seats right here to make out.

549
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:34,726
- What do they look like?
- One is a beautiful woman with dark hair

550
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,645
and a fierceness
that's both scary and inspiring.

551
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:40,648
The other is a guy.

552
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,943
- You know I can make this happen.
- Good.

553

[announcer] Number 40, Luis Severino.

554
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:50,408
Yankees' 24-year-old Dominican pitcher
is on the mound to start.

555
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,912
So, Rick's here. If you see the...

556
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:57,790
- You see the U? He's right above.
- Do you have a telescope so I can see him?

557
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:01,210
- Are seats this far back legal?
- These are the best.

558
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:04,672
There's a community here.
And you can see the whole field.

559
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:06,716
And there's Dennis.

560
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,843
Hi, sweetheart. How you doing?

561
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:12,555
Dennis introduced me to the Gerilympics.
He's a heavy weightlifting champ.

562
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:17,477
- What does he bench, negative 10?
- I heard that, you little pissant.

I'm old, not deaf.

564

- Is that your boyfriend?
- Absolutely not, Dennis.

565
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:23,816
Good.

I'm gonna take a picture of you
and post it on Tinder.

You know, guys love girls
who like sports.

- Are you kidding me?
- They do.

571
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:46,464
They think they like girls liking sports.
They like a girl in a tight sports jersey

serving wings
and getting terms wrong.

- How else would I get here?

00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:20,540
No, I mean, because nobody...
Nobody peed.

You're welcome to take this seat
until my colleague gets here.

589
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,403
It's the best seat in the stadium.

590
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:54,282
Actually, it's just
the most expensive seat.

From where I'm sitting,
you hear both coaches better.

Wait. Oh, yeah!
That is what I'm talking about!

909
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:33,483
[yells]

910
00:52:35,151 --> 00:52:36,027
That's my laptop.

911
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:38,947
Bring me my laptop.

912
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:45,036
How could you let them
pick the restaurant?

913
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,539
- It was your turn to choose.
- No, you chose last time.

914
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:49,749
Damn it.

915
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,544
Rick is worse than before.

916
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:54,629
- He tried to fire a mailman today.
- My God.

917
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:58,341
- Mailmen work for the U.S. government.
- Get them together before they kill us.

918
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:01,303
I can feel it in my bones
that Kirsten is capable of murder.

919
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,973
- [exhales] So, what are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

920
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:08,059
It's your turn to figure something out.

921
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:11,396
Why isn't there anything
in my calendar at 2 p.m.?

922
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:13,690
You know I need a hard out
after family events.

923
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:16,818
Oh, my. I'm so sorry. I didn't know
that your lunch was with family.

924
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:19,946
- I'll figure it out right now.
- If I pay you to make my life easier,

925
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:23,158
but instead, you make it harder,
you're useless to me.

926
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:24,326
Do you understand?

927
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:33,126
So, bad news is,
Kirsten ripped me a new one.

928
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:36,296
Good news is I now have time
to see Golf Guy.

929
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:39,090
- Mm.
- What is this? Charlie?

930
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:44,971
- Oh, my God.
- This is Rick's son's science project.

931
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:50,393
Life gave me lemons,
and I used it to battery-power lemonade.

932
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,979
Can you... fix it?

933
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:58,610
No. It was a masterpiece,
and now he's not even getting a ribbon.

934
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:03,156
Go, get out of here. Save yourself.

935
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:07,285
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

936
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:15,293
We need a new project.
Whole new thing.

937
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:18,129
- Yeah.
- What about Golf Guy?

938
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:21,216
I don't wanna squeeze
my salamander too hard.

939
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:26,304
I honestly did not know that someone could
do this to lemons with their bare hands.

940
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:31,768
[Charlie laughing] Rick was so pissed.

941
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:36,022
Imagine if a duck were on meth,
it was like, "Hey, Charlie. Charlie."

942
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:39,359
- Sounded like that duck.
- Why do you work for this guy?

943
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:43,446
- Why don't you just... quit?
- Are you insane?

944
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:46,658
I've spent three years
doing every shit errand imaginable.

945
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:48,576
Can't quit.

946
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:52,789
I'd have to start all over,
and all of this would've been a waste.

947
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:57,877
Plus, Rick is the most respected VC
of all time, so if he makes me an analyst,

948
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:00,797
- I can get a job anywhere.
- But do you like the actual work?

949
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,800
Nobody likes the actual work.
That's the job.

950
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:05,927
Do the best one
where you make the most money.

951
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:06,845
Hmm.

952
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,685
Okay, why do you work for Kirsten?

953
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:17,480
I work for Kirsten because I wanna write
the articles that made me cry

954
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:21,234
when I was a little girl, and Kirsten's
the best sports journalist there is.

955
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:24,029
Well, has she read any of your stuff?

956
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:27,949
I haven't written anything
or finished writing anything.

957
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:31,119
My days are so long
and so exhausting

958
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:34,873
it's like when I have time,
everything I write is... bad.

959
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:38,334
- That is probably not true.
- It is true.

960
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:41,921
I think I wanted to impress her
and I wanted her to like me,

961
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:47,010
so, it's just like, I worked so hard
at being this great assistant

962
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:49,471
and making sure she was happy that...

963
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:55,602
I don't know, feels like I might have lost
any writing skill I ever had.

964
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:59,689
Well, that is definitely not true.

965
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:03,318
You're a terrible assistant.

966
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:05,612
[laughs]

967
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,490
Can you pass me a few of those?

968
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:16,790
- You ready?
- I'm ready.

969
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:21,127
- What?
- Yeah.

970
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,379
Holy shit. How does that work?

971
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:26,091
Well, the bonds in the milk connect
with the DNA in the...

972
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:28,968
I have no idea. I'm not a scientist.

973
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:36,935
All the supplies are in the bag.
Feels like a winner.

974
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:39,813
This isn't as good as the lemons.

975
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:47,237
[Charlie over phone] He wasn't happy,
but he didn't break anything,

976
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:50,740
- so, maybe that's an improvement.
- [Harper] Well, technically, he's right,

977
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:53,034
but given the fact
that we did that in the night,

978
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:56,371
- Magic Milk should win a Nobel Prize.
- [Rick] Charlie!

979
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:57,747
Yo!

980
00:56:57,831 --> 00:57:00,375
- Oh, my God. I think Rick's drunk.
- What?

981
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:01,709
[laughs]

982
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:05,004
I've never seen him drunk before.
He's violent when he's sober.

983
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,589
- Charlie...?
- [line disconnects]

984
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:10,885
[humming]

985
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:14,931
- Yeah.
- Do it with me, white boy.

986
00:57:17,308 --> 00:57:20,228
Yeah. Get over here, you dig it?
Come on, man.

987
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:22,814
Come on.

988
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:25,233
[singing] Charlie chicken and grits

989
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:26,359
Huh!

990
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:28,528
You don't know that shit.

991
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:31,948
Um...

992
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:36,327
You're a good guy.

993
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:40,582
Do you know that?

994
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,335
- For real.
- What?

995
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:50,800
I appreciate you.

996
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:54,929
And I should tell you that more often.

997
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:03,980
Good idea. Let's have another drink.

998
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:11,571
- Okay.
- Oh, no. No, no, no. I got it.

999
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:20,288
I hate losing, Charlie.

1000
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:24,000
And she thinks I'm a loser.

1001
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:26,377
What should I do?

1002
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,132
You're a person.

1003
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:33,510
What would you do?

1004
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:40,475
- Apologize.
- No. Next.

1005
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:44,479
Tell her she's good at her job.
Tell her you respect what she does.

1006
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:47,607
Just tell her you see her.

1007
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:49,984
Ew.

1008
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:55,031
- What does that even mean?
- I don't know.

1009
00:58:57,075 --> 00:59:01,079
I think maybe it's just...
Maybe it's just what I'd wanna hear.

1010
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:03,831
[computer beeps]

1011
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:05,792
Hmm?

1012
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:12,632
[door closes nearby]

1013
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:21,391
Hey.

1014
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:25,019
- What are you doing here?
- [clears throat]

1015
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:26,729
I see you.

1016
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:31,734
What? What does that even mean?

1017
00:59:32,443 --> 00:59:33,278
I see you.

1018
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:35,280
"I see you," like...

1019
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:37,657
I see you.

1020
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:42,912
[chuckles]

1021
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:48,042
- Oh. Lock the door.
- Mm-hm.

1022
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:52,380
Yes, ma'am.

1023
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:55,133
I meant that as a joke.

1024
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:56,843
[laughing]

1025
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:57,969
You're the boss.

1026
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,055
[Rick laughs]

1027
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:08,104
Let's go to your apartment. I'm serious.
[laughs]

1028
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:11,441
Rick.

1029
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:12,650
[both laughing]

1030
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:23,286
[knock on door]

1031
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:25,997
- [Harper] Charlie?
- I want rose petals everywhere.

1032
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,374
I need it to look like a massacre
at a flower shop.

1033
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:31,711
Nantucket is a go. They land in an hour,
I put the champagne

1034
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:35,298
- on Rick's credit card. Here you go.
- Hotel room is all set.

1035
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,760
- It's about to be Boner City in there.
- Wow, okay.

1036
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:42,138
Someone say Boner City?
Frigging love that place.

1037
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:44,932
Harper, this is Duncan. My roommate.

1038
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:47,101
He's a teacher
at a middle school in the Bronx.

1039
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:49,604
But he's gay, so,
keep your ovaries in your pants.

1040
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:52,899
- I'll just shove them back in there.
- [Charlie] What are you...?

1041
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:56,653
- Why are you dressed like that?
- For Becca's engagement party tonight.

1042
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:00,239
What are you wearing?
Where are the rest of your shorts?

1043
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:04,577
These are cool, all right?
Suze likes short shorts on guys.

1044
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:07,121
- Stop.
- [laughing] Your shorts suck.

1045
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:09,791
You know what, stop it.
You're not friends.

1046
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:12,210
- I feel like we're becoming friends.
- We're friends.

1047
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:14,712
- Do you wanna come to this party?
- I don't think so.

1048
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:17,256
I gotta finish writing this article
to distract myself.

1049
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,675
Distract yourself from what?

1050
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:21,010
The fact that Golf Guy
hasn't called me in a few days.

1051
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:24,180
- Like zero contact?
- Yeah, but he'll call me soon,

1052
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:26,641
'cause he said he was gonna come
to Becca's party tonight.

1053
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:30,561
- Whatever. It's not like I care.
- It's gonna be fun.

1054
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:32,438
- Duncan?
- [Duncan] Free booze and hot dogs.

1055
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:35,733
- You've convinced me. I'll be there.
- Perfect. She's my plus one.

1056
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:39,320
You're my plus one.
I'm Suze's plus one. You're a plus two.

1057
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:41,656
- So, she's my plus three.
- I'm his plus three.

1058
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:42,573
What?

1059
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:44,325
[cheering]

1060

01:10:19,465 --> 01:10:22,384
- What does that mean?
- He's hooking up with a guy.

1207
01:10:23,135 --> 01:10:24,678
Duncan is gay?

1208

What?

I'm kidding.

We cannot interrupt him.

Do you know how athletic I was?

1212

Impressed yet?

1213
01:10:36,815 --> 01:10:37,900
I'm so hungry.

1214

Too hungry.

1215
01:10:40,444 --> 01:10:41,570
Oh, God. Nope.

1216
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:43,364
- Do you need some help?
- Yeah.

1217
01:10:48,285 --> 01:10:51,956
- Give me the pizza.
- No. I'm gonna take it up to the top.

1218
01:10:52,039 --> 01:10:54,458
Absolutely not, your hands
are too small. Ah!

1219
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:56,418
- Charlie.
- I'll hold it in one hand.

1220
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:59,255
I'm gonna move my way up this ladder
like a monkey. Stop.

1221
01:10:59,338 --> 01:11:01,173
Stop. I got this.

1222
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:04,343
- All right.
- Oh, my God.

1223
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:07,805
Stop. Keep the top up.
Otherwise the cheese will slide.

1224
01:11:07,888 --> 01:11:10,140
- [laughs]
- Please don't drop my pizza.

1225
01:11:10,224 --> 01:11:14,061
- What? Just stop making me laugh.
- I'm serious.

1226
01:11:14,144 --> 01:11:16,730
- Stop making me laugh.
- I'm not trying to. I mean it.

1227
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:19,692
- Okay?
- It is in my possession. I got this.

1228
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:23,529
- [Harper] Oh, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

Hi.

1262

- What are you doing here?
- You two, in my office, now.

1263
01:14:12,739 --> 01:14:13,824
[Rick] Charlie,

1264
01:14:13,907 --> 01:14:14,950
this is Kirsten.

1265
01:14:15,033 --> 01:14:17,703
- Kirsten's assistant, Helga.
- Harper.

1266
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:20,664
Hello.

1267
01:14:23,208 --> 01:14:26,753
You two should get to know each other
because Kirsten and I,

1268
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:28,297
we're getting married.

1269
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:30,549
Wow.

1270
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:32,092
- [Harper] Really?
- That's great.

1271
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:33,302
Amazing.

1272
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:35,512
Wonderful. [chuckles]

1273
01:14:35,596 --> 01:14:38,307
We're flying to St. John's,
we're gonna elope on the beach,

1274
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:42,603
sunsets, all that romantic shit.
We want you two to set it up.

1275
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:46,231
Us. Of course.
Obviously, because who else would do it?

1276
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:48,734
- We can do that.
- Sunset, St. John's.

How come you're not writing this down

- What's going on?
- Oh. Um...

That's so soon.

1283

I'm gonna be gone for so long,
there's gonna be little to do.

Invite all the usual girls.

1304
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:04,685
Maybe we should have a party before
the wedding. What's on my agenda?

1305
01:16:04,768 --> 01:16:07,396
You have Mary's baby shower,
but I canceled that for you.

1306

- I'll go to that now.
- You will?

they'll wanna talk about.

All right. Sorry.

I'm gonna give you some advice.

1311

Men don't wanna date you
when you're beating them to a story.

1312
01:16:26,748 --> 01:16:29,585
But I have met someone
who wants me to be strong.

1313
01:16:29,668 --> 01:16:33,005
And he likes that I'm successful.
He's a goddamn unicorn.

01:16:33,213 --> 01:16:34,339
[chuckles]

1315
01:16:34,798 --> 01:16:36,508
I don't know. It feels like fate.

1316
01:16:38,051 --> 01:16:40,012
- I know that I've been cunty.
- You haven't.

1317
01:16:40,304 --> 01:16:42,889
- Don't be those women that can't say cunt.
- I am not.

1318
01:16:45,726 --> 01:16:48,228
I know I've been cunty.
It's partly because you're young

1319
01:16:48,312 --> 01:16:51,106
and your skin bounces back,
and it annoys me, but...

1320
01:16:51,356 --> 01:16:53,150
it's because I want you to succeed.

1321
01:16:55,027 --> 01:16:56,695
What do you mean?

1322
01:16:57,195 --> 01:16:59,281
I see so much potential in you.

1323
01:16:59,823 --> 01:17:01,950
But you have to have tough skin.

1324
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:06,872
So, if I'm the most awful person when this
shitstorm of an industry is hard on you,

1325
01:17:06,955 --> 01:17:08,790
I know that you'll be prepared.

1326
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,003
MyChef Series A is gonna be
such a disaster.

1327
01:17:13,503 --> 01:17:16,006
We're so smart we didn't invest with them.

1328
01:17:16,214 --> 01:17:17,758
Don't forget to tell Kiki.

1329
01:17:18,216 --> 01:17:21,011
- About MyChef?
- No, dummy. About the wedding.

1330
01:17:21,219 --> 01:17:23,430
And the date. Six weeks before hers.

1331
01:17:23,513 --> 01:17:24,473
Is she invited?

1332
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:28,477
Send her a big bouquet of daisies.
She hates daisies.

1333
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,103
With a note that says, "Ha, ha.

1334
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:34,107
I'm gonna beat you to the altar.
But tonight, we're gonna knock boots

1335
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:35,942
like we did on that Swiss gondola."

1336
01:17:36,026 --> 01:17:37,444
- And, obviously,
- Um, what?

1337
01:17:37,527 --> 01:17:40,489
tell Kirsten I have a meeting
or something tonight.

1338
01:17:43,283 --> 01:17:45,619
Well... I just thought, uh...

1339
01:17:46,703 --> 01:17:49,039
I thought you were gonna marry Kirsten.

1340
01:17:49,289 --> 01:17:53,335
Yeah, I am. Which reminds me.
This week, go to a ring spot

1341
01:17:53,418 --> 01:17:56,171
and get a ring so big,
you can see that shit from space.

1342
01:17:58,548 --> 01:17:59,800
Food here sucks.

1343
01:18:03,804 --> 01:18:05,305
Charlie, you did it.

1344
01:18:06,223 --> 01:18:07,641
What? Well, I didn't.

1345
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:09,643
I did it. We both did it.

1346
01:18:09,893 --> 01:18:11,436
What are we talking about?

1347
01:18:12,896 --> 01:18:17,442
I know this started out selfishly for us,
but we made two people fall in love.

1348
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:20,028
We made two miserable people happy.

1349
01:18:20,654 --> 01:18:23,532
I thought best-case,
they'd date for a month.

1350
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:27,703
But they actually really like each other.
We changed their lives.

1351
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:32,666
I'm proud of us.
I think we did something really good.

1352
01:18:34,501 --> 01:18:35,335
Me, too.

1353
01:18:36,253 --> 01:18:38,755
So, I was looking at
the, uh, Caneel Bay Resort.

1354
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:41,341
They have a, uh, slot next Saturday.

1355
01:18:50,308 --> 01:18:52,686
Will you come help me pick out the ring?

1356
01:18:52,894 --> 01:18:55,772
Absolutely not. I gotta go to the office,
drop off these things.

1357
01:18:56,231 --> 01:18:58,650
Please? You're better at this than me.

1358
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:01,862
I need female expertise.
You know what Kirsten likes.

1359
01:19:01,945 --> 01:19:04,781
You're beautiful.
You're charming. You are witty.

1360

01:27:38,002 --> 01:27:41,798
You're not a bad writer yet.
Stop feeling sorry for yourself

1514
01:27:41,881 --> 01:27:43,633
and just write something bad.

1515
01:27:43,967 --> 01:27:47,804
Yes, Kirsten was mean.
But you learned so much from her.

1516
01:27:47,887 --> 01:27:50,139
You just never had the time to use it.

1517
01:27:50,890 --> 01:27:53,935
And now, bud, you got the time.

1518
01:27:54,018 --> 01:27:57,230
So, get off your bony little ass
and just do it!

1519
01:27:57,313 --> 01:27:58,815
- Okay.
- Okay.

1520
01:27:59,649 --> 01:28:00,733
I'm gonna write...

1521
01:28:01,651 --> 01:28:04,487
the shittiest article ever written.

1522
01:28:04,570 --> 01:28:06,864
Yes. It's gonna suck ass.
I can't wait to read it.

1523
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:09,242
Okay. I got this.

1524
01:28:09,325 --> 01:28:11,327
Okay. Okay. Yes. Okay.

1525
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:14,622
Are you cleaning this up?
Are we gonna hire someone?

1526
01:28:18,835 --> 01:28:22,338
I am not leaving this chair
until I write an entire article.

1527
01:28:23,256 --> 01:28:27,427
- Great. That's great news for me.
- Can I get some free chips and water?

1528
01:28:30,888 --> 01:28:32,557
[Suze] I always wanted to eat here.

1529
01:28:33,016 --> 01:28:36,561
This is where Kim
threw Kanye's half-birthday party.

1530
01:28:37,103 --> 01:28:38,438
Our best table.

1531
01:28:45,278 --> 01:28:46,696
This is exciting.

1532
01:28:55,371 --> 01:28:56,414
Mm.

1533
01:28:58,041 --> 01:28:58,875
Oh, my God.

1534
01:29:00,043 --> 01:29:03,129
This is the best meal I've ever had.

1535
01:29:10,762 --> 01:29:14,474
The best meal I ever had
was a $5 pizza thrown up a fire escape.

1536
01:29:16,476 --> 01:29:17,310
What?

1537
01:29:21,606 --> 01:29:22,565
This sucks.

1538
01:29:23,775 --> 01:29:25,151
This whole place sucks.

1539
01:29:26,402 --> 01:29:28,946
It smells weird. It's far too quiet.

1540
01:29:29,447 --> 01:29:32,492
And this steak is delicious.
It is not worth $70.

1541
01:29:32,950 --> 01:29:36,371
And you and I,
we never talk about anything.

1542
01:29:40,374 --> 01:29:43,544
I don't want to wanna be an asshole.

1543
01:29:44,504 --> 01:29:46,047
You sound insane.

1544
01:29:47,256 --> 01:29:48,466
Just eat your steak.

1545
01:29:53,262 --> 01:29:56,516
If my 15-year-old self would see me now,
he would punch me in the dick.

1546
01:29:58,935 --> 01:30:00,770
I don't wanna do this anymore, Suze.

1547
01:30:01,562 --> 01:30:03,022
But you're my backup.

1548
01:30:04,524 --> 01:30:05,483
Mm.

1549
01:30:09,946 --> 01:30:10,780
You know what?

1550
01:30:11,739 --> 01:30:14,075
Order whatever you want, on me.

1551
01:30:17,161 --> 01:30:20,039
What am I doing? You're not
my girlfriend anymore. Give me that.

1552
01:30:20,123 --> 01:30:21,332
I'm not Rockefeller.

1553
01:30:26,879 --> 01:30:28,714
[cell phone buzzing]

1554
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:35,346
Harper. You were right.

1555
01:30:35,805 --> 01:30:38,474
We can't let them do this.
I'm going to JFK.

1556
01:30:38,724 --> 01:30:40,143
Meet me at the terminal.

1557
01:30:40,977 --> 01:30:42,145
It's the cheap one.

1558
01:30:43,396 --> 01:30:45,439
Don't have time. Leaving the coat.

1559
01:30:45,982 --> 01:30:48,985
I need a taxi.
I gotta get to the airport right now.

1560
01:30:49,068 --> 01:30:52,655
I gotta stop someone from getting married.
Flight leaves in... Oh.

1561
01:30:53,197 --> 01:30:54,615
I got, like, four hours.

1562
01:30:55,324 --> 01:30:58,911
And we've been to Times Square. What about
museums? Should we go to the Met?

1563
01:30:58,995 --> 01:31:02,748
Do you like beautiful art that makes you
re-examine what it means to be human?

1564
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:05,126
- Yeah.
- Then, yeah. The Met's worth it.

1565
01:31:05,209 --> 01:31:08,713
In fact, it may still be open
if you go right... Oh, my God.

1566
01:31:08,796 --> 01:31:10,756
I did the over-dick-around thing.

1567
01:31:16,012 --> 01:31:16,846
Sorry.

1568
01:31:20,975 --> 01:31:21,809
Rick?

1569
01:31:25,938 --> 01:31:28,065
Hey. Did I forget something?

1570
01:31:28,691 --> 01:31:30,818
Yeah. That you're a bastard.

1571
01:31:33,237 --> 01:31:35,781
I don't wanna be like you.
I'm not gonna be.

1572
01:31:36,949 --> 01:31:39,035
I don't want the promotion. I quit.

1573
01:31:41,078 --> 01:31:41,954
Okay.

1574
01:31:42,538 --> 01:31:44,582
Kirsten? Don't marry him.

1575
01:31:45,041 --> 01:31:46,042
[chuckles]

1576
01:31:46,292 --> 01:31:49,670
Do it, honey. Go with the young guy.

1577
01:31:52,215 --> 01:31:53,299
Oh, no. No, no.

1578
01:31:53,382 --> 01:31:55,885
I mean, she's a very handsome woman.
Just...

1579
01:31:56,010 --> 01:31:59,388
- Not what's going on here.
- Charlie. You're fired as fuck.

1580
01:31:59,472 --> 01:32:01,349
I literally just quit.

1581
01:32:01,974 --> 01:32:04,310
Kirsten, I know you don't know me,
but I know you,

1582
01:32:04,393 --> 01:32:06,479
because all Harper does is talk about you.

1583
01:32:07,146 --> 01:32:10,524
And even when she's complaining about you,
she's really complimenting you.

1584
01:32:10,858 --> 01:32:13,277
I know how hard you work
and what a badass you are,

1585
01:32:13,361 --> 01:32:17,657
and I know you don't put up with any shit.
So, don't put up with his.

1586
01:32:18,991 --> 01:32:22,620
I don't know what you think you're getting
out of this, but you deserve better.

1587
01:32:23,246 --> 01:32:24,163
You are better.

1588
01:32:26,457 --> 01:32:29,460
Oh, my God. Gave myself goose bumps.

1589
01:32:29,710 --> 01:32:31,420
He's crazy. You realize that?

1590
01:32:32,296 --> 01:32:33,130
Hmm?

1591
01:32:36,634 --> 01:32:37,843
What's my favorite food?

1592
01:32:39,971 --> 01:32:42,348
Your favorite... It's steak tartare.

1593
01:32:43,099 --> 01:32:45,351
It's green curry, you douche-tard.

1594
01:32:45,434 --> 01:32:48,771
She likes it medium-spicy
from Thai Leaf on Broadway.

1595
01:32:49,897 --> 01:32:51,399
What's my favorite place?

1596
01:32:52,525 --> 01:32:54,402
Kiki, I ca... [clears throat]

1597
01:32:54,485 --> 01:32:55,653
This is ridiculous.

1598
01:32:56,112 --> 01:32:56,946
Why are we...?

1599
01:32:57,989 --> 01:32:58,823
Kirsten.

1600
01:33:00,241 --> 01:33:01,492
Your name is Kirsten.

1601
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:04,912
Squam Lake, New Hampshire,
you douche-tard.

1602
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:08,332
Charlie,
I know you're no longer his assistant,

1603
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:10,960
but could you please strike "wedding"
from his calendar?

1604
01:33:11,335 --> 01:33:12,670
Absolutely.

1605
01:33:13,713 --> 01:33:15,047
Are you being serious?

1606
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:18,175
No. Kiki's short for Kirsten.

1607
01:33:38,779 --> 01:33:39,697
I finished.

1608
01:33:41,574 --> 01:33:42,658
I finished.

1609
01:33:43,701 --> 01:33:44,785
The whole article.

1610
01:33:45,828 --> 01:33:47,413
I finished it.

1611
01:33:47,496 --> 01:33:49,332
From beginning to end.

1612
01:33:50,583 --> 01:33:53,085
I finished it. I finished the whole thing.

1613
01:33:53,169 --> 01:33:55,463
You, sir, are a hero and scholar,

1614
01:33:55,546 --> 01:33:58,883
and are about to receive the greatest tip
in the history of the service industry.

1615
01:34:02,178 --> 01:34:05,264
Technically, I don't have my wallet on me.
Tomorrow...

1616
01:34:05,348 --> 01:34:07,350
Leave this place and never return.

1617
01:34:11,562 --> 01:34:12,772
[whispers] I did it.

1618
01:34:15,149 --> 01:34:16,400
[knock on door]

1619
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:20,237
Hey.

1620
01:34:20,696 --> 01:34:22,907
- What do you want?
- You live here?

1621
01:34:24,867 --> 01:34:25,993
It's disgusting.

1622
01:34:26,702 --> 01:34:28,245
Hold up. Hold up, hold up.

1623
01:34:28,621 --> 01:34:29,872
I'm sorry. I just...

1624
01:34:29,955 --> 01:34:30,831
I, uh...

1625
01:34:31,624 --> 01:34:34,960
I need some information on, uh, my wife.
My ex-wife.

1626
01:34:35,294 --> 01:34:36,253
Like what?

1627
01:34:37,213 --> 01:34:38,297
Uh...

1628
01:34:38,589 --> 01:34:41,717
I got some written down here.
Uh, assorted favorites,

1629
01:34:41,801 --> 01:34:43,844
as in, uh, favorite foods,

1630
01:34:43,928 --> 01:34:47,014
- flowers, clothing...
- Are you serious?

1631
01:34:47,723 --> 01:34:51,477
Look, I realize I should know this.
But you used to do all this stuff for me.

1632
01:34:56,190 --> 01:34:57,316
I want her back.

1633
01:35:00,611 --> 01:35:02,029
I have an old Kiki file.

1634
01:35:02,988 --> 01:35:04,573
- I'll send it over to you.
- [exhales]

1635
01:35:05,741 --> 01:35:06,992
Thank you. Thank you.

1636
01:35:07,493 --> 01:35:08,536
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

1637
01:35:09,245 --> 01:35:11,372
- I really appreciate this.
- Rick.

1638
01:35:11,831 --> 01:35:13,999
- You still work for this guy?
- Nope.

1639
01:35:16,961 --> 01:35:19,088
It's soy. Nice seeing you, Rick.

1640
01:35:21,048 --> 01:35:21,882
[Charlie] Bye, Rick.

1641
01:35:39,024 --> 01:35:40,151
- Hi.
- Oh.

1642
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:42,194
Thank God you're here.

1643
01:35:42,278 --> 01:35:45,823
I can't find that piece
on lesbian soccer players in Nigeria.

1644
01:35:46,407 --> 01:35:48,492
Probably in your "deleted" folder.

1645
01:35:48,576 --> 01:35:50,828
- I can't find Julie's number.
- You made me change it

1646
01:35:50,911 --> 01:35:53,414
- to Satan in your contacts.
- Come back to work.

1647
01:35:54,081 --> 01:35:54,915
What?

1648
01:35:54,999 --> 01:35:59,003
You crossed every line ever.
I genuinely considered setting you up

1649
01:35:59,086 --> 01:36:01,714
for white-collar crime
and just letting you rot in jail.

1650
01:36:04,008 --> 01:36:06,635
But I understand in some ways
what you were trying to do.

1651
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:08,846
You're not an unintelligent person.

1652
01:36:09,054 --> 01:36:12,266
I don't know how you did all this.
This place is falling apart without you.

1653
01:36:16,145 --> 01:36:17,897
Come back and do it with me.

1654
01:36:19,148 --> 01:36:20,858
I learned so much from you.

1655
01:36:23,277 --> 01:36:24,236
You're my hero.

1656
01:36:28,699 --> 01:36:33,412
But if I wanna actually be a writer, I
have to stop making excuses not to write.

1657
01:36:35,664 --> 01:36:37,458
So, I can't be your assistant.

1658
01:36:38,834 --> 01:36:40,377
But I'd love to help you find a new one.

1659
01:36:42,671 --> 01:36:43,797
You're fired again.

1660
01:36:44,215 --> 01:36:47,843
- I have to get my stuff. This is awkward.
- Have you written anything?

1661
01:36:48,385 --> 01:36:50,888
Have I written anything? Yes.
I have written something.

1662
01:36:50,971 --> 01:36:53,265
It's just... It's right here.

1663
01:36:54,225 --> 01:36:55,434
Let's go over it.

1664
01:36:56,101 --> 01:36:59,438
- Tell me something I don't know.
- Okay.

1665
01:37:02,483 --> 01:37:05,319
- "Twilight Champions."
- Yeah, but that title is...

1666
01:37:05,402 --> 01:37:09,323
- No, I like it. I love the title.
- I like it, too. I could like it.

1667
01:37:09,406 --> 01:37:11,742
This is about the geriatric Olympiads?

If I spend too much time
on Gilda in the beginning,

1669
01:37:14,870 --> 01:37:18,582
people will know that she's gonna die.
Let her death be a twist.

1670
01:37:19,166 --> 01:37:21,877
Hold off until
after Harry wins his first med...

1671
01:37:49,113 --> 01:37:49,947
Hi.

1672
01:37:50,906 --> 01:37:51,740
Hi.

1673
01:37:54,326 --> 01:37:56,036
So, what are you doing here?

1674
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:59,540
Oh, Kirsten told me to meet her.
What are you doing here?

1675
01:38:02,001 --> 01:38:03,877
Oh, my God.

1676
01:38:05,838 --> 01:38:07,506
- She Cyrano'd us.
- Yes, she...

1677
01:38:08,215 --> 01:38:10,718
I Googled it.
So, I know what it means now.

1678
01:38:13,971 --> 01:38:15,264
Why are you dressed like that?

1679
01:38:16,307 --> 01:38:19,268
I don't work here anymore.
I quit working for Rick.

1680
01:38:21,186 --> 01:38:23,355
Starting over. At 28.

1681
01:38:24,481 --> 01:38:27,651
Actually, I'm a temp,
which is technically lower

1682
01:38:27,735 --> 01:38:31,989
on the totem pole than an assistant,
which is kind of a kick in the nuts.

1683
01:38:33,490 --> 01:38:38,245
But it's, um, kind of cool.
I get to see a bunch of different jobs.

1684
01:38:39,455 --> 01:38:41,248
Find out what I actually like.

1685
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:43,834
I like you.

1686
01:38:45,961 --> 01:38:47,046
So, so much.

1687
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:51,383
You're not hard to get at all.

1688
01:38:52,551 --> 01:38:53,761
You're hard to earn.

1689
01:38:54,887 --> 01:38:56,639
It's so much better.

1690
01:38:58,474 --> 01:39:01,810
You displayed a total lack of character
when it mattered.

1691
01:39:04,855 --> 01:39:05,689
I know.

1692
01:39:08,275 --> 01:39:13,030
Charlie, you have the romantic and
sexual personality of a seventh-grader.

1693
01:39:14,990 --> 01:39:17,534
Seventh?
I feel like it'd be at least high school.

1694
01:39:17,826 --> 01:39:19,703
You wear suits to sports games.

1695
01:39:21,205 --> 01:39:22,039
What?

1696
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:29,171
You're a know-it-all.

1697
01:39:30,381 --> 01:39:34,176
You are unbelievably bad at beer pong.

1698
01:39:34,843 --> 01:39:38,555
You're a sore winner.
And you use too many exclamation points.

1699
01:39:42,393 --> 01:39:43,394
And yet...
